We define an $S$-number to be a natural number, $n$, that is a perfect square and its square root can be obtained by splitting the decimal representation of $n$ into $2$ or more numbers then adding the numbers.
</p>
<p>
For example, $81$ is an $S$-number because $\sqrt{81} = 8+1$.<br>
$6724$ is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{6724} = 6+72+4$. <br>
$8281$ is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{8281} = 8+2+81 = 82+8+1$.<br>
$9801$ is an $S$-number: $\sqrt{9801}=98+0+1$.
</p>
<p>
Further we define $T(N)$ to be the sum of all $S$ numbers $n\le N$. You are given $T(10^4) = 41333$.

<p>
Find $T(10^{12})$.
