<p>There is a grid of length and width 50515093 points. A clock is placed on each grid point. The clocks are all analogue showing a single hour hand initially pointing at 12.</p>  

<p>A sequence $S_t$ is created where:
$$
\begin{align}
S_0 &amp;= 290797\\
S_t &amp;= S_{t-1}^2 \bmod 50515093 &amp;t&gt;0
\end{align}
$$
The four numbers $N_t = (S_{4t-4}, S_{4t-3}, S_{4t-2}, S_{4t-1})$ represent a range within the grid, with the first pair of numbers representing the x-bounds and the second pair representing the y-bounds. For example, if $N_t = (3,9,47,20)$, the range would be $3\le x\le 9$ and $20\le y\le47$, and would include 196 clocks.</p>

<p>For each $t$ $(t&gt;0)$, the clocks within the range represented by $N_t$ are moved to the next hour $12\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 2\rightarrow \cdots $.</p>

<p>We define $C(t)$ to be the sum of the hours that the clock hands are pointing to after timestep $t$.<br />
You are given $C(0) = 30621295449583788$, $C(1) =  30613048345941659$, $C(10) = 21808930308198471$ and $C(100) = 16190667393984172$.</p>

<p>Find $C(10^5)$.</p>
