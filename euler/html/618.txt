<p>Consider the numbers $15$, $16$ and $18$:<br>
$15=3\times 5$ and $3+5=8$.<br>
$16 = 2\times 2\times 2\times 2$ and $2+2+2+2=8$.<br>
$18 = 2\times 3\times 3$ and $2+3+3=8$.<br> 

$15$, $16$ and $18$ are the only numbers that have $8$ as sum of the prime factors (counted with multiplicity).</p>
<p>
We define $S(k)$ to be the sum of all numbers $n$ where the sum of the prime factors (with multiplicity)  of $n$ is $k$.<br>
Hence $S(8) = 15+16+18 = 49$.<br>
Other examples: $S(1) = 0$, $S(2) = 2$, $S(3) = 3$, $S(5) = 5 + 6 = 11$.</p>
<p>
The Fibonacci sequence is $F_1 = 1$, $F_2 = 1$, $F_3 = 2$, $F_4 = 3$, $F_5 = 5$, ....<br>
Find the last nine digits of $\displaystyle\sum_{k=2}^{24}S(F_k)$.</p>
