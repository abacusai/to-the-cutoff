<p>The number $145$ is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to $145$:
$$1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.$$</p>
<p>Perhaps less well known is $169$, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to $169$; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:</p>
\begin{align}
&amp;169 \to 363601 \to 1454 \to 169\\
&amp;871 \to 45361 \to 871\\
&amp;872 \to 45362 \to 872
\end{align}
<p>It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,</p>
\begin{align}
&amp;69 \to 363600 \to 1454 \to 169 \to 363601 (\to 1454)\\
&amp;78 \to 45360 \to 871 \to 45361 (\to 871)\\
&amp;540 \to 145 (\to 145)
\end{align}
<p>Starting with $69$ produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.</p>
<p>How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?</p>
