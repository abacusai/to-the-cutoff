<p>Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the following formulae:</p>

<td>$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \dots$</td>
</tr><tr><td>Square</td>

<td>$1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \dots$</td>
</tr><tr><td>Pentagonal</td>

</tr></table><p>The ordered set of three $4$-digit numbers: $8128$, $2882$, $8281$, has three interesting properties.</p>
<ol><li>The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).</li>
<li>Each polygonal type: triangle ($P_{3,127}=8128$), square ($P_{4,91}=8281$), and pentagonal ($P_{5,44}=2882$), is represented by a different number in the set.</li>
<li>This is the only set of $4$-digit numbers with this property.</li>
</ol><p>Find the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic $4$-digit numbers for which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in the set.</p>
