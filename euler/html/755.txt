Consider the Fibonacci sequence $\{1,2,3,5,8,13,21,\ldots\}$.
</p>
<p>
We let $f(n)$ be the number of ways of representing an integer $n\ge 0$ as the sum of different Fibonacci numbers.<br>
For example, $16 = 3+13 = 1+2+13 = 3+5+8 = 1+2+5+8$ and hence $f(16) = 4$. 
By convention $f(0) = 1$.
</p>
<p>
Further we define
$$S(n) = \sum_{k=0}^n f(k).$$
You are given $S(100) = 415$ and $S(10^4) = 312807$.

Find $\displaystyle S(10^{13})$.
