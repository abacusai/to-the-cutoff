<p>
An integer of the form $p^q q^p$ with prime numbers $p \neq q$ is called a <dfn>hybrid-integer</dfn>.<br>
For example, $800 = 2^5 5^2$ is a hybrid-integer.
</p>
<p>
We define $C(n)$ to be the number of hybrid-integers less than or equal to $n$.<br>
You are given $C(800) = 2$ and $C(800^{800}) = 10790$.
</p>
<p>
Find $C(800800^{800800})$.
