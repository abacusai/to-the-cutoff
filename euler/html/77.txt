<p>It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:</p>
\begin{align}
&amp;7 + 3\\
&amp;5 + 5\\
&amp;5 + 3 + 2\\
&amp;3 + 3 + 2 + 2\\
&amp;2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
\end{align}
<p>What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five thousand different ways?</p>
