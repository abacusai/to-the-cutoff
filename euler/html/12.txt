<p>The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the $7$<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$. The first ten terms would be:
$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \dots$$</p>
<p>Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:</p>
<blockquote class="monospace"><b> 1</b>: 1<br><b> 3</b>: 1,3<br><b> 6</b>: 1,2,3,6<br><b>10</b>: 1,2,5,10<br><b>15</b>: 1,3,5,15<br><b>21</b>: 1,3,7,21<br><b>28</b>: 1,2,4,7,14,28</blockquote>
<p>We can see that $28$ is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.</p>
<p>What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>
