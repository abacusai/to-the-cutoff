<p>Let $g(n)$ be the number of <strong>undirected graphs</strong> with $n$ nodes satisfying the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The graph is connected and has no cycles or multiple edges.</li>
<li>Each node is either red, blue, or yellow.</li>
<li>A red node may have no more than 4 edges connected to it.</li>
<li>A blue or yellow node may have no more than 3 edges connected to it.</li>
<li>An edge may not directly connect a yellow node to a yellow node.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, $g(2)=5$, $g(3)=15$, and $g(4) = 57$.<br>
You are also given that $g(10) = 710249$ and $g(100) \equiv 919747298 \pmod{1\,000\,000\,007}$.</p>

<p>Find $g(10\,000) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.</p>
