<p>Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
\begin{align}
1634 &amp;= 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4\\
8208 &amp;= 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4\\
9474 &amp;= 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
\end{align}
</p><p class="smaller">As $1 = 1^4$ is not a sum it is not included.</p>
<p>The sum of these numbers is $1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316$.</p>
<p>Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.</p>
