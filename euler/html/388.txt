Consider all lattice points $(a,b,c)$ with $0 \le a,b,c \le N$.
</p>
<p>
From the origin $O(0,0,0)$ all lines are drawn to the other lattice points.<br>
Let $D(N)$ be the number of <i>distinct</i> such lines.
</p>
<p>
You are given that $D(1\,000\,000) = 831909254469114121$.
</p><p>
Find $D(10^{10})$. Give as your answer the first nine digits followed by the last nine digits.
