<p>
Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula: $P_n = \tfrac 12n(3n-1)$ giving the sequence:
</p>
$$1,5,12,22,35, 51,70,92,\ldots $$
<p>
Some pentagonal numbers can be expressed as the sum of two other pentagonal numbers.<br />
For example:
</p>
$$P_8 = 92 = 22 + 70 = P_4 + P_7$$
<p>
3577 is the smallest pentagonal number that can be expressed as the sum of two pentagonal numbers in two different ways
</p>
$$
\begin{align}
P_{49} = 3577 &amp; = 3432 + 145 = P_{48} + P_{10} \\
 &amp; = 3290 + 287 = P_{47}+P_{14}
\end{align}
$$
<p>
107602 is the smallest pentagonal number that can be expressed as the sum of two pentagonal numbers in three different ways.
</p>
<p>
