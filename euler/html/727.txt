<p>Let $r_a$, $r_b$ and $r_c$ be the radii of three circles that are mutually and externally tangent to each other. The three circles then form a <dfn>triangle of circular arcs</dfn> between their tangency points as shown for the three blue circles in the picture below.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p727_circular_arcs.jpg" alt="CircularArcs" /></div>

<p></p>
Define the circumcircle of this triangle to be the red circle, with centre $D$, passing through their tangency points. Further define the incircle of this triangle to be the green circle, with centre $E$, that is mutually and externally tangent to all the three blue circles. Let $d=\vert DE \vert$ be the distance between the centres of the circumcircle and the incircle.
<p>
Let $\mathbb{E}(d)$ be the expected value of $d$ when $r_a$, $r_b$ and $r_c$ are integers chosen uniformly such that $1\leq r_a&lt;r_b&lt;r_c \leq 100$ and $\text{gcd}(r_a,r_b,r_c)=1$.</p>
<p>
Find $\mathbb{E}(d)$, rounded to eight places after the decimal point.</p>
