Given $n$ equally spaced points on a circle, we define an <dfn>$n$-star polygon</dfn> as an $n$-gon having those $n$ points as vertices. Two $n$-star polygons differing by a rotation/reflection are considered <b>different</b>.</p>

<p>
For example, there are twelve $5$-star polygons shown below.</p>

<p>
For an $n$-star polygon $S$, let $I(S)$ be the number of its self intersection points.<br>
Let $T(n)$ be the sum of $I(S)$ over all $n$-star polygons $S$.<br>
For the example above $T(5) = 20$ because in total there are $20$ self intersection points.</p>

<p>
Some star polygons may have intersection points made from more than two lines. These are only counted once. For example, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">$S$,</span> shown below is one of the sixty $6$-star polygons. This one has $I(S) = 4$.</p>

<p>
You are also given that $T(8) = 14640$.</p>

<p>
Find $\displaystyle \sum_{n = 3}^{60}T(n)$. Give your answer modulo $(10^9 + 7)$.</p>
