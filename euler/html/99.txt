<p>Comparing two numbers written in index form like $2^{11}$ and $3^7$ is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that $2^{11} = 2048 \lt 3^7 = 2187$.</p>
<p>However, confirming that $632382^{518061} \gt 519432^{525806}$ would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.</p>
<p>Using <a href="resources/documents/0099_base_exp.txt">base_exp.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.</p>
<p class="smaller">NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.</p>
