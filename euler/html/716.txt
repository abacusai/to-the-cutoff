Consider a directed graph made from an orthogonal lattice of $H\times W$ nodes. 
The edges are the horizontal and vertical connections between adjacent nodes.
$W$ vertical directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction. Similarly, $H$ horizontal directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction.
</p>
<p>
Two nodes, $A$ and $B$ in a directed graph, are <strong>strongly connected</strong> if there is both a path, along the directed edges, from $A$ to $B$ as well as from $B$ to $A$. Note that every node is strongly connected to itself.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>strongly connected component</strong> in a directed graph is a non-empty set $M$ of nodes satisfying the following two properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>All nodes in $M$ are strongly connected to each other.</li>
<li>$M$ is maximal, in the sense that no node in $M$ is strongly connected to any node outside of $M$.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are $2^H\times 2^W$ ways of drawing the directed lines. Each way gives a directed graph $\mathcal{G}$. We define $S(\mathcal{G})$ to be the number of strongly connected components in $\mathcal{G}$.
</p>
<p>
The illustration below shows a directed graph with $H=3$ and $W=4$ that consists of four different strongly connected components (indicated by the different colours).

Define $C(H,W)$ to be the sum of $S(\mathcal{G})$ for all possible graphs on a grid of $H\times W$. You are given $C(3,3) = 408$, $C(3,6) = 4696$ and $C(10,20) \equiv 988971143 \pmod{1\,000\,000\,007}$.
</p>
<p>
Find $C(10\,000,20\,000)$ giving your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
