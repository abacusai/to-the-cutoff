A positive integer $N$ is <dfn>stealthy</dfn>, if there exist positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ such that $ab = cd = N$ and $a+b = c+d+1$.<br />
For example, $36 = 4\times 9 = 6\times 6$ is stealthy.
</p>
<p>
You are also given that there are 2851 stealthy numbers not exceeding $10^6$.
</p>
<p>
How many stealthy numbers  are there that don't exceed $10^{14}$?
