<p>Consider the fraction, $\dfrac n d$, where $n$ and $d$ are positive integers. If $n \lt d$ and $\operatorname{HCF}(n, d)=1$, it is called a reduced proper fraction.</p>
<p>If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \le 8$ in ascending order of size, we get:
$$\frac 1 8, \frac 1 7, \frac 1 6, \frac 1 5, \frac 1 4, \frac 2 7, \frac 1 3, \mathbf{\frac 3 8, \frac 2 5, \frac 3 7}, \frac 1 2, \frac 4 7, \frac 3 5, \frac 5 8, \frac 2 3, \frac 5 7, \frac 3 4, \frac 4 5, \frac 5 6, \frac 6 7, \frac 7 8$$</p>
<p>It can be seen that there are $3$ fractions between $\dfrac 1 3$ and $\dfrac 1 2$.</p>
<p>How many fractions lie between $\dfrac 1 3$ and $\dfrac 1 2$ in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for $d \le 12\,000$?</p>
