<p>
A square is drawn around a circle as shown in the diagram below on the left.<br>
We shall call the blue shaded region the L-section.<br>
A line is drawn from the bottom left of the square to the top right as shown in the diagram on the right.<br>
We shall call the orange shaded region a <dfn>concave triangle</dfn>.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0587_concave_triangle_1.png?1678992053" class="dark_img" alt="0587_concave_triangle_1.png">
</div>
<p>
It should be clear that the concave triangle occupies exactly half of the L-section.
</p>
<p>

Two circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around both circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right as shown in the diagram below.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0587_concave_triangle_2.png?1678992053" class="dark_img" alt="0587_concave_triangle_2.png">
</div>
<p>
This time the concave triangle occupies approximately 36.46% of the L-section.
</p>
<p>
If $n$ circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around the <var>n</var> circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right, then it can be shown that the least value of <var>n</var> for which the concave triangle occupies less than 10% of the L-section is $n = 15$.
</p>
<p>
What is the least value of $n$ for which the concave triangle occupies less than 0.1% of the L-section?
