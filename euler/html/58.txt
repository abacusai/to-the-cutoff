<p>Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.</p>
<p class="center monospace"><span class="red"><b>37</b></span> 36 35 34 33 32 <span class="red"><b>31</b></span><br>
38 <span class="red"><b>17</b></span> 16 15 14 <span class="red"><b>13</b></span> 30<br>
39 18 <span class="red"> <b>5</b></span>  4 <span class="red"> <b>3</b></span> 12 29<br>
40 19  6  1  2 11 28<br>
41 20 <span class="red"> <b>7</b></span>  8  9 10 27<br>
42 21 22 23 24 25 26<br><span class="red"><b>43</b></span> 44 45 46 47 48 49</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ≈ 62%.</p>
<p>If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?</p>
