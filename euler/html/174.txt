<p>We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.</p>
<p>Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: 3x3 square with a 1x1 hole in the middle. However, using thirty-two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae.</p>
<div class="center">

<p>If <var>t</var> represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that <var>t</var> = 8 is type L(1) and <var>t</var> = 32 is type L(2).</p>
<p>Let N(<var>n</var>) be the number of <var>t</var> ≤ 1000000 such that <var>t</var> is type L(<var>n</var>); for example, N(15) = 832.</p>
<p>What is <span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">∑</span></span> N(<var>n</var>) for 1 ≤ <var>n</var> ≤ 10?</p>
