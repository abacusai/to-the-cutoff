<p>Let us define a <dfn>geometric triangle</dfn> as an integer sided triangle with sides $a \le b \le c$ so that its sides form a <strong>geometric progression</strong>, i.e. $b^2 = a \cdot c$</p> 

<p>An example of such a geometric triangle is the triangle with sides $a = 144$, $b = 156$ and $c = 169$.</p>

<p>There are $861805$ geometric triangles with perimeter $\le 10^6$.</p>

<p>How many geometric triangles exist with perimeter $\le 2.5 \cdot 10^{13}$?</p>
