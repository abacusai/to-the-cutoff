Define $F(n)$ to be the number of integers $xâ‰¤n$ that can be written in the form $x=a^2b^3$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers not necessarily different and both greater than 1.</p>
<p>
For example, $32=2^2\times 2^3$  and $72=3^2\times 2^3$ are the only two integers less than $100$ that can be written in this form. Hence, $F(100)=2$.

<p>
Further you are given $F(2\times 10^4)=130$ and $F(3\times 10^6)=2014$.

Find $F(9\times 10^{18})$.
