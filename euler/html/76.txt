<p>It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:</p>
\begin{align}
&amp;4 + 1\\
&amp;3 + 2\\
&amp;3 + 1 + 1\\
&amp;2 + 2 + 1\\
&amp;2 + 1 + 1 + 1\\
&amp;1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
\end{align}
<p>How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?</p>
