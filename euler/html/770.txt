<p>
A and B play a game. A has originally $1$ gram of gold and B has an unlimited amount.
Each round goes as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A chooses and displays, $x$, a nonnegative real number no larger than the amount of gold that A has.</li>
<li>
Either B chooses to TAKE. Then A gives B $x$ grams of gold.</li>
<li>
Or B chooses to GIVE. Then B gives A $x$ grams of gold.</li>
</ul>
<p>
B TAKEs $n$ times and GIVEs $n$ times after which the game finishes.</p>
<p>
Define $g(X)$ to be the smallest value of $n$ so that A can guarantee to have at least $X$ grams of gold at the end of the game. You are given $g(1.7) = 10$.
</p>
<p>
Find $g(1.9999)$.
