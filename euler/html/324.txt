<p>Let $f(n)$ represent the number of ways one can fill a $3 \times 3 \times n$ tower with blocks of $2 \times 1 \times 1$.<br>You're allowed to rotate the blocks in any way you like; however, rotations, reflections etc of the tower itself are counted as distinct.</p>
<p>For example (with $q = 100000007$):<br>$f(2) = 229$,<br>$f(4) = 117805$,<br>$f(10) \bmod q = 96149360$,<br>$f(10^3) \bmod q = 24806056$,<br>$f(10^6) \bmod q = 30808124$.</p>

<p>Find $f(10^{10000}) \bmod 100000007$.</p>
