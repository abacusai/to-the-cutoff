<p>A certain type of flexible tile comes in three different sizes - $1 \times 1$, $1 \times 2$, and $1 \times 3$ - and in $k$ different colours. There is an unlimited number of tiles available in each combination of size and colour.</p>

<p>These are used to tile a closed loop of width $2$ and length (circumference) $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The loop must be fully covered by non-overlapping tiles.</li>
<li>It is <i>not</i> permitted for four tiles to have their corners meeting at a single point.</li>
<li>Adjacent tiles must be of different colours.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the following is an acceptable tiling of a $2\times 23$ loop with $k=4$ (blue, green, red and yellow):</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0671_loop_acceptable.png?1678992054" alt="Acceptable colouring">
</div>

<p>but the following is not an acceptable tiling, because it violates the "no four corners meeting at a point" rule:</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="resources/images/0671_loop_unacceptable.png?1678992054" alt="Unacceptable colouring">
</div>

<p>Let $F_k(n)$ be the number of ways the $2\times n$ loop can be tiled subject to these rules when $k$ colours are available. (Not all $k$ colours have to be used.) Where reflecting horizontally or vertically would give a different tiling, these tilings are to be counted separately.</p>

<p>For example, $F_4(3) = 104$, $F_5(7) = 3327300$, and $F_6(101)\equiv 75309980 \pmod{1\,000\,004\,321}$.</p>
<p>Find $F_{10}(10\,004\,003\,002\,001) \bmod 1\,000\,004\,321$.</p>
