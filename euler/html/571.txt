<p>A positive number is <strong>pandigital</strong> in base $b$ if it contains all digits from $0$ to $b - 1$ at least once when written in base $b$.</p>

<p>An <dfn>$n$-super-pandigital</dfn> number is a number that is simultaneously pandigital in all bases from $2$ to $n$ inclusively.<br>
For example $978 = 1111010010_2 = 1100020_3 = 33102_4 = 12403_5$ is the smallest $5$-super-pandigital number.<br>
Similarly, $1093265784$ is the smallest $10$-super-pandigital number.<br>
The sum of the $10$ smallest $10$-super-pandigital numbers is $20319792309$.</p>

<p>What is the sum of the $10$ smallest $12$-super-pandigital numbers?</p>
