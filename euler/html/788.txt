<p>
A <dfn>dominating number</dfn> is a positive integer that has more than half of its digits equal.
</p>
<p>
For example, $2022$ is a dominating number because three of its four digits are equal to $2$. But $2021$ is not a dominating number.
</p>
<p>
Let $D(N)$ be how many dominating numbers are less than $10^N$.
For example, $D(4) = 603$ and $D(10) = 21893256$.
</p>
<p>
Find $D(2022)$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
