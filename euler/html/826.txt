<p>Consider a wire of length 1 unit between two posts. Every morning $n$ birds land on it randomly with every point on the wire equally likely to host a bird. The interval from each bird to its closest neighbour is then painted.</p>

<p>Define $F(n)$ to be the expected length of the wire that is painted. You are given $F(3) = 0.5$.</p>

<p>Find the average of $F(n)$ where $n$ ranges through all odd prime less than a million. Give your answer rounded to 10 places after the decimal point.</p>
