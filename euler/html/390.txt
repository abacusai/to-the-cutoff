<p>Consider the triangle with sides $\sqrt 5$, $\sqrt {65}$ and $\sqrt {68}$.
It can be shown that this triangle has area $9$.</p>

<p>$S(n)$ is the sum of the areas of  all triangles with sides $\sqrt{1+b^2}$, $\sqrt {1+c^2}$ and $\sqrt{b^2+c^2}\,$ (for positive integers $b$ and $c$) that have an integral area not exceeding $n$.</p>

<p>The example triangle has $b=2$ and $c=8$.</p>

<p>$S(10^6)=18018206$.</p>

<p>Find $S(10^{10})$.</p>
