<p>The <strong>blancmange curve</strong> is the set of points $(x, y)$ such that $0 \le x \le 1$ and $y = \sum \limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} {\dfrac{s(2^n x)}{2^n}}$, where $s(x)$ is the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer.</p>

<p>The area under the blancmange curve is equal to Â½, shown in pink in the diagram below.</p>

<p>Let $C$ be the circle with centre $\left ( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2} \right )$ and radius $\frac{1}{4}$, shown in black in the diagram.</p>

<p>What area under the blancmange curve is enclosed by $C$?<br>Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form <i>0.abcdefgh</i>.</p>
