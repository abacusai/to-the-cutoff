<p>A <dfn>symmetrical convex grid polygon</dfn> is a polygon such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All its vertices have integer coordinates.</li>
<li>All its internal angles are strictly smaller than $180^\circ$.</li>
<li>It has both horizontal and vertical symmetry.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the left polygon is a convex grid polygon which has neither horizontal nor vertical symmetry, while the right one is a valid symmetrical convex grid polygon with six vertices:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="resources/images/0742_hexagons.jpg?1678992055" class="dark_img" alt=""></div>

<p>Define $A(N)$, the minimum area of a symmetrical convex grid polygon with $N$ vertices.</p>

<p>You are given $A(4) = 1$, $A(8) = 7$, $A(40) = 1039$ and $A(100) = 17473$.</p>

<p>Find $A(1000)$.</p>
