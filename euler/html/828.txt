<p>It is a common recreational problem to make a target number using a selection of other numbers. In this problem you will be given six numbers and a target number.</p>

<p>For example, given the six numbers $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, $7$, $25$, and a target of $211$, one possible solution is:</p>
$$211 = (3+6)\times 25 − (4\times7)\div 2$$
<p>This uses all six numbers. However, it is not necessary to do so. Another solution that does not use the $7$ is:</p>
$$211 = (25−2)\times (6+3) + 4$$

<p>Define the <em>score</em> of a solution to be the sum of the numbers used. In the above example problem, the two given solutions have scores $47$ and $40$ respectively. It turns out that this problem has no solutions with score less than $40$.</p>

<p>When combining numbers, the following rules must be observed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each available number may be used at most once.</li>
<li>Only the four basic arithmetic operations are permitted: $+$, $-$, $\times$, $\div$.</li>
<li>All intermediate values must be positive integers, so for example $(3\div 2)$ is never permitted as a subexpression (even if the final answer is an integer).</li>
</ul>

<p>The attached file <a href="project/resources/p828_number_challenges.txt">number-challenges.txt</a> contains 200 problems, one per line in the format:</p>
<center><big><tt>211:2,3,4,6,7,25</tt></big></center>
<p>where the number before the colon is the target and the remaining comma-separated numbers are those available to be used.</p>

<p>Numbering the problems 1, 2, ..., 200, we let $s_n$ be the minimum score of the solution to the $n$th problem. For example, $s_1=40$, as the first problem in the file is the example given above. Note that not all problems have a solution; in such cases we take $s_n=0$.</p>

<p>Find $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{200} 3^n s_n$. Give your answer modulo $1005075251$.</p>
