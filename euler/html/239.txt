<p>A set of disks numbered $1$ through $100$ are placed in a line in random order.</p>

<p>What is the probability that we have a partial derangement such that exactly $22$ prime number discs are found away from their natural positions?<br>
(Any number of non-prime disks may also be found in or out of their natural positions.)</p>

<p>Give your answer rounded to $12$ places behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghijkl.</p>
