<p>Define $f(0)=1$ and $f(n)$ to be the number of different ways $n$ can be expressed as a sum of integer powers of $2$ using each power no more than twice.</p>
<p>For example, $f(10)=5$ since there are five different ways to express $10$:</p>
\begin{align}
&amp; 1 + 1 + 8\\
&amp; 1 + 1 + 4 + 4\\
&amp; 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4\\
&amp; 2 + 4 + 4\\
&amp; 2 + 8
\end{align}
<p>What is $f(10^{25})$?</p>
