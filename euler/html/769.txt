<p>Consider the following binary quadratic form:</p>
$$
\begin{align}
f(x,y)=x^2+5xy+3y^2
\end{align}
$$
<p>A positive integer $q$ has a primitive representation if there exist positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that $q = f(x,y)$ and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">$\gcd(x,y)=1$.</span></p>

<p>We are interested in primitive representations of perfect squares. For example:<br />
$17^2=f(1,9)$<br />
$87^2=f(13,40) = f(46,19)$</p>

<p>Define $C(N)$ as the total number of primitive representations of $z^2$ for $0 &lt; z \leq N$.<br /> 
Multiple representations are counted separately, so for example $z=87$ is counted twice.</p>

<p>You are given $C(10^3)=142$ and $C(10^{6})=142463$ </p>

<p>Find $C(10^{14})$.</p>
