<p>
An $n \times n$ grid of squares contains $n^2$ ants, one ant per square.<br>
All ants decide to move simultaneously to an adjacent square (usually $4$ possibilities, except for ants on the edge of the grid or at the corners).<br>
We define $f(n)$ to be the number of ways this can happen without any ants ending on the same square and without any two ants crossing the same edge between two squares.

<p>
You are given that $f(4) = 88$.<br>
Find $f(10)$.
