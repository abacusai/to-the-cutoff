<p>A googol ($10^{100}$) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; $100^{100}$ is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only $1$.</p>
<p>Considering natural numbers of the form, $a^b$, where $a, b \lt 100$, what is the maximum digital sum?</p>
