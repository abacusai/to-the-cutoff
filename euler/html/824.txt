<p>A <dfn>Slider</dfn> is a chess piece that can move one square left or right.</p>

<p>This problem uses a cylindrical chess board where the left hand edge of the board is connected to the right hand edge. This means that a Slider that is on the left hand edge of the chess board can move to the right hand edge of the same row and vice versa.</p>

<p>Let $L(N,K)$ be the number of ways $K$ non-attacking Sliders can be placed on an $N \times N$ cylindrical chess-board.</p>

<p>For example, $L(2,2)=4$ and $L(6,12)=4204761$.</p>

<p>Find $L(10^9,10^{15}) \bmod \left(10^7+19\right)^2$.</p>
