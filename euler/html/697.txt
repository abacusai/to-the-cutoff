<p>Given a fixed real number $c$, define a random sequence $(X_n)_{n\ge 0}$ by the following random process:</p>
<ul><li>$X_0 = c$ (with probability 1).</li>
<li>For $n&gt;0$, $X_n = U_n X_{n-1}$ where $U_n$ is a real number chosen at random between zero and one, uniformly, and independently of all previous choices $(U_m)_{m&lt;n}$.</li>
</ul><p>If we desire there to be precisely a 25% probability that $X_{100}&lt;1$, then this can be arranged by fixing $c$ such that $\log_{10} c \approx 46.27$.</p>

<p>Suppose now that $c$ is set to a different value, so that there is precisely a 25% probability that $X_{10\,000\,000}&lt;1$.</p>
<p>Find $\log_{10} c$ and give your answer rounded to two places after the decimal point.</p>
