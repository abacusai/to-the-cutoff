<p>The number $512$ is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits raised to some power: $5 + 1 + 2 = 8$, and $8^3 = 512$. Another example of a number with this property is $614656 = 28^4$.</p>
<p>We shall define $a_n$ to be the $n$th term of this sequence and insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.</p>
<p>You are given that $a_2 = 512$ and $a_{10} = 614656$.</p>
<p>Find $a_{30}$.</p>
