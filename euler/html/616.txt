<p>Alice plays the following game, she starts with a list of integers $L$ and on each step she can either:
</p><ul><li>remove two elements $a$ and $b$ from $L$ and add $a^b$ to $L$</li>
<li>or conversely remove an element $c$ from $L$ that can be written as $a^b$, with $a$ and $b$ being two integers such that $a, b &gt; 1$, and add both $a$ and $b$ to $L$</li></ul> 
<p>For example starting from the list $L=\{8\}$, Alice can remove $8$ and add $2$ and $3$ resulting in $L=\{2,3\}$ in a first step. Then she can obtain $L=\{9\}$ in a second step.</p>

<p>Note that the same integer is allowed to appear multiple times in the list.</p>

<p>An integer $n&gt;1$ is said to be <dfn>creative</dfn> if for any integer $m \gt 1$ Alice can obtain a list that contains $m$ starting from $L=\{n\}$.

</p><p>Find the sum of all creative integers less than or equal to $10^{12}$.</p>
