<p>
Two players are playing a game, alternating turns. There are $k$ piles of stones.
On each turn, a player has to choose a pile and replace it with two piles of stones under the following two conditions:
</p>

<ul><li> Both new piles must have a number of stones more than one and less than the number of stones of the original pile.</li>
<li> The number of stones of each of the new piles must be a divisor of the number of stones of the original pile.</li></ul>

<p>
The first player unable to make a valid move loses.
<br>
Let $f(n,k)$ be the number of winning positions for the first player, assuming perfect play, when the game is played with $k$ piles each having between $2$ and $n$ stones (inclusively).<br>$f(10,5)=40085$.
</p>
<p>
Find $f(10^7,10^{12})$.<br>Give your answer modulo $987654321$.
