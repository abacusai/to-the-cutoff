<p>Let's call an integer sided triangle with exactly one angle of $60$ degrees a $60$-degree triangle.<br>
Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle of such a $60$-degree triangle.</p>
<p>There are $1234$ $60$-degree triangles for which $r \le 100$.
<br>Let $T(n)$ be the number of $60$-degree triangles for which $r \le n$, so<br>
$T(100) = 1234$, $T(1000) = 22767$, and $T(10000) = 359912$.</p>

<p>Find $T(1053779)$.</p>
