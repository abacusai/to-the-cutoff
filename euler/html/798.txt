<p>
Two players play a game with a deck of cards which contains $s$ suits with each suit containing $n$ cards numbered from $1$ to $n$.</p>

<p>
Before the game starts, a set of cards (which may be empty) is picked from the deck and placed face-up on the table, with no overlap. These are called the visible cards.</p>

<p>
The players then make moves in turn.<br />
A move consists of choosing a card X from the rest of the deck and placing it face-up on top of a visible card Y, subject to the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>X and Y must be the same suit;</li>
<li>the value of X must be larger than the value of Y.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The card X then covers the card Y and replaces Y as a visible card.<br />
The player unable to make a valid move loses and play stops.</p>

<p>
Let $C(n, s)$ be the number of different initial sets of cards for which the first player will lose given best play for both players.</p>

<p>
For example, $C(3, 2) = 26$ and $C(13, 4) \equiv 540318329 \pmod {1\,000\,000\,007}$.</p>

<p>
Find $C(10^7, 10^7)$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.</p>
