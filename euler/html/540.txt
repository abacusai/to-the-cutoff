<p>
A <strong>Pythagorean triple</strong> consists of three positive integers $a, b$ and $c$ satisfying $a^2+b^2=c^2$.<br>
The triple is called primitive if $a, b$ and $c$ are relatively prime.<br>
Let $P(n)$ be the number of <strong>primitive Pythagorean triples</strong> with $a \lt b \lt c \le n$.<br>
For example $P(20) = 3$, since there are three triples: $(3,4,5)$, $(5,12,13)$ and $(8,15,17)$.

You are given that $P(10^6) = 159139$.<br>
Find $P(3141592653589793)$.
