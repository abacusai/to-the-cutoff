The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring
3 × 2 × 1 is twenty-two.

If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes
to cover every visible face, the third layer would require seventy-eight
cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to
cover every visible face.

However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5 × 1 × 1 also
requires twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring 5
× 3 × 1, 7 × 2 × 1, and 11 × 1 × 1 all
contain forty-six cubes.

We shall define C(n) to represent the number of cuboids that contain n
cubes in one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5, and
C(118) = 8.

It turns out that 154 is the least value of n for which C(n) = 10.

Find the least value of n for which C(n) = 1000.
