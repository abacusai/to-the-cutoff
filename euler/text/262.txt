The following equation represents the _continuous_ topography of a mountainous
region, giving the **elevation height above sea level** h at any point (x,
y): 
    h = (5000 - x^2 + y^2 + xy/200 + 25(x + y)/2)
    · e^-|x^2 + y^2/1000000 - 3(x + y)/2000 + 7/10|.


A mosquito intends to fly from A(200,200) to B(1400,1400), without leaving
the area given by 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1600.

Because of the intervening mountains, it first rises straight up to a point
A^', having elevation f. Then, while remaining at the same elevation
f, it flies around any obstacles until it arrives at a point B^'
directly above B.

First, determine f_min which is the minimum constant elevation
allowing such a trip from A to B, while remaining in the specified area.  
Then, find the length of the shortest path between A^' and B^',
while flying at that constant elevation f_min.

Give that length as your answer, rounded to three decimal places.

_Note_ : For convenience, the elevation function shown above is repeated
below, in a form suitable for most programming languages:  
h=( 5000-0.005*(x*x+y*y+x*y)+12.5*(x+y) ) * exp(
-abs(0.000001*(x*x+y*y)-0.0015*(x+y)+0.7) )
