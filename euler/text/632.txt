For an integer n, we define the square prime factors of n to be the primes
whose square divides n. For example, the square prime factors of 1500=2^2
× 3 × 5^3 are 2 and 5.

Let C_k(N) be the number of integers between 1 and N inclusive with
exactly k square prime factors. You are given some values of C_k(N) in the
table below.




Find the product of all non-zero C_k(10^16). Give the result reduced
modulo 1 000 000 007.
