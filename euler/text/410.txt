Let C be the circle with radius r, x^2 + y^2 = r^2. We choose two points
P(a, b) and Q(-a, c) so that the line passing through P and Q is
tangent to C.

For example, the quadruplet (r, a, b, c) = (2, 6, 2, -7) satisfies this
property.

Let F(R, X) be the number of the integer quadruplets (r, a, b, c) with
this property, and with 0  r ≤ R and 0  a ≤ X.

We can verify that F(1, 5) = 10, F(2, 10) = 52 and F(10, 100) = 3384.  
Find F(10^8, 10^9) + F(10^9, 10^8).
