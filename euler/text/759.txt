The function f is defined for all positive integers as follows:


    f(1)    = 1
     f(2n)    = 2f(n)
     f(2n+1)    = 2n+1 + 2f(n)+
    1n f(n)


It can be proven that f(n) is integer for all values of n.

The function S(n) is defined as S(n) = âˆ‘_i=1^n f(i) ^2.

For example, S(10)=1530 and S(10^2)=4798445.

Find S(10^16). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
