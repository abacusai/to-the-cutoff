The number 209 can be expressed as a^2 + 3ab + b^2 in two distinct ways:

209 = 8^2 + 3路 8路 5 + 5^2  
209 = 13^2 + 3路13路 1 + 1^2

Let f(n,r) be the number of integers k not exceeding n that can be
expressed as k=a^2 + 3ab + b^2, with a  b  0 integers, in exactly
r different ways.

You are given that f(10^5, 4) = 237 and f(10^8, 6) = 59517.

Find f(10^15, 40).
