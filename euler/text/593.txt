We define two sequences S = 
S(1), S(2), ..., S(n) and S_2 =

S_2(1), S_2(2), ..., S_2(n):

S(k) = (p_k)^k  10007 where p_k is the kth prime number.

S_2(k) = S(k) + S(⌊k/10000⌋ + 1) where ⌊·⌋ denotes the floor function.

Then let M(i, j) be the median of elements S_2(i) through S_2(j),
inclusive. For example, M(1, 10) = 2021.5 and M(10^2, 10^3) = 4715.0.

Let F(n, k) = ∑_i=1^n-k+1 M(i, i + k - 1). For example, F(100, 10) =
463628.5 and F(10^5, 10^4) = 675348207.5.

Find F(10^7, 10^5). If the sum is not an integer, use .5 to denote a half.
Otherwise, use .0 instead.
