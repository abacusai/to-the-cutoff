Members of a species of bacteria occur in two different types: α and
β. Individual bacteria are capable of multiplying and mutating between
the types according to the following rules:

  * Every minute, each individual will simultaneously undergo some kind of transformation.
  * Each individual A of type α will, independently, do one of the following (at random with equal probability): 
    * clone itself, resulting in a new bacterium of type α (alongside A who remains)
    * split into 3 new bacteria of type β (replacing A)
  * Each individual B of type β will, independently, do one of the following (at random with equal probability): 
    * spawn a new bacterium of type α (alongside B who remains)
    * die

If a population starts with a single bacterium of type α, then it can
be shown that there is a 0.07243802 probability that the population will
eventually die out, and a 0.92756198 probability that the population will last
forever. These probabilities are given rounded to 8 decimal places.

Now consider another species of bacteria, S_k,m (where k and m are
positive integers), which occurs in k different types α_i for 0≤
i< k. The rules governing this species' lifecycle involve the sequence r_n
defined by:

  * r_0 = 306
  * r_n+1 = r_n^2  10 007

Every minute, for each i, each bacterium A of type α_i will
independently choose an integer j uniformly at random in the range 0≤
j<m. What it then does depends on q = r_im+j 5:

  * If q=0, A dies.
  * If q=1, A clones itself, resulting in a new bacterium of type α_i (alongside A who remains).
  * If q=2, A mutates, changing into type α_(2i)  k.
  * If q=3, A splits into 3 new bacteria of type α_(i^2+1)  k (replacing A).
  * If q=4, A spawns a new bacterium of type α_(i+1)  k (alongside A who remains).

In fact, our original species was none other than S_2,2, with
α=α_0 and β=α_1.

Let P_k,m be the probability that a population of species S_k,m,
starting with a single bacterium of type α_0, will eventually die out.
So P_2,2 = 0.07243802. You are also given that P_4,3 = 0.18554021 and
P_10,5 = 0.53466253, all rounded to 8 decimal places.

Find P_500,10, and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places.
