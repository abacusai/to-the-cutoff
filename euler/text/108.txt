In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.


    1x + 1y = 1n


For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:


    15 + 120   = 14
         16 +
        112   = 14
         18 + 18   = 14


What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions
exceeds one-thousand?

NOTE: This problem is an easier version of [Problem 110](problem=110); it is
strongly advised that you solve this one first.
