Consider a honey bee's honeycomb where each cell is a perfect regular hexagon
with side length 1.

One particular cell is occupied by the queen bee.  
For a positive real number L, let B(L) count the cells with
distance L from the queen bee cell (all distances are measured from centre
to centre); you may assume that the honeycomb is large enough to accommodate
for any distance we wish to consider.  
For example, B(√(3))=6, B(√(21)) = 12 and
B(111 111 111) = 54.

Find the number of L ≤ 5 × 10^11 such that B(L) = 450.
