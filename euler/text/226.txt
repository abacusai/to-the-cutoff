The **blancmange curve** is the set of points (x, y) such that 0 ≤ x ≤
1 and y = ∑_n = 0^∞s(2^n x)2^n, where
s(x) is the distance from x to the nearest integer.

The area under the blancmange curve is equal to ½, shown in pink in the
diagram below.

Let C be the circle with centre ( 1/4, 1/2 )
and radius 1/4, shown in black in the diagram.

What area under the blancmange curve is enclosed by C?  
Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form _0.abcdefgh_.
