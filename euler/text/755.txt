Consider the Fibonacci sequence 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,….

We let f(n) be the number of ways of representing an integer n≥ 0 as the
sum of different Fibonacci numbers.  
For example, 16 = 3+13 = 1+2+13 = 3+5+8 = 1+2+5+8 and hence f(16) = 4. By
convention f(0) = 1.

Further we define 
    S(n) = ∑_k=0^n f(k).
 You are given S(100) = 415
and S(10^4) = 312807.

Find S(10^13).
