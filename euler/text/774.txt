Let '&' denote the bitwise AND operation.  
For example, 10 &  12 = 1010_2 &  1100_2 = 1000_2 = 8.

We shall call a finite sequence of non-negative integers (a_1, a_2, …,
a_n) conjunctive if a_i &  a_i+1≠ 0 for all i=1… n-1.

Define c(n,b) to be the number of conjunctive sequences of length n in
which all terms are ≤ b.

You are given that c(3,4)=18, c(10,6)=2496120, and c(100,200) ≡
268159379 998244353.

Find c(123,123456789). Give your answer modulo 998244353.
