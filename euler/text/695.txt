Three points, P_1, P_2 and P_3, are randomly selected within a unit
square. Consider the three rectangles with sides parallel to the sides of the
unit square and a diagonal that is one of the three line segments
P_1P_2, P_1P_3 or P_2P_3 (see picture
below).

We are interested in the rectangle with the second biggest area. In the
example above that happens to be the green rectangle defined with the diagonal
P_2P_3.

Find the expected value of the area of the second biggest of the three
rectangles. Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.
