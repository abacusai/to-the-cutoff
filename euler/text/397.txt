On the parabola y = x^2/k, three points A(a, a^2/k), B(b, b^2/k) and
C(c, c^2/k) are chosen.

Let F(K, X) be the number of the integer quadruplets (k, a, b, c) such
that at least one angle of the triangle ABC is 45-degree, with 1 ≤ k
≤ K and -X ≤ a  b  c ≤ X.

For example, F(1, 10) = 41 and F(10, 100) = 12492.  
Find F(10^6, 10^9).
