Upside Down is a modification of the famous Pythagorean equation:

    1/x^2+1/y^2=13/z^2.


A solution (x,y,z) to this equation with x,y and z positive integers is
a primitive solution if (x,y,z)=1.

Let S(N) be the sum of x+y+z over primitive Upside Down solutions such
that 1 ≤ x,y,z ≤ N and x ≤ y.  
For N=100 the primitive solutions are (2,3,6) and (5,90,18), thus
S(10^2)=124.  
It can be checked that S(10^3)=1470 and S(10^5)=2340084.

Find S(10^16) and give the last 9 digits as your answer.
