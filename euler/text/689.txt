For 0 ≤ x  1, define d_i(x) to be the ith digit after the binary
point of the binary representation of x.  
For example d_2(0.25) = 1, d_i(0.25) = 0 for i  2.

Let f(x) = ∑_i=1^∞d_i(x)/i^2.

Let p(a) be probability that f(x)  a, given that x is uniformly
distributed between 0 and 1.

Find p(0.5). Give your answer rounded to 8 digits after the decimal point.
