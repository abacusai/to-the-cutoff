For any positive integer k, a finite sequence a_i of fractions x_i/y_i
is defined by:  
a_1 = 1/k and  
a_i = (x_i - 1 + 1) / (y_i - 1 - 1) reduced to lowest terms for i 
1.  
When a_i reaches some integer n, the sequence stops. (That is, when y_i =
1.)  
Define f(k) = n.  
For example, for k = 20:

1/20 → 2/19 → 3/18 = 1/6 → 2/5 → 3/4 → 4/3 → 5/2 → 6/1 = 6

So f(20) = 6.

Also f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 1 and ∑ f(k^3) = 118937 for 1 ≤
k ≤ 100.

Find ∑ f(k^3) for 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^6.
