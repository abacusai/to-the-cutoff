The **Golomb's self-describing sequence** (G(n)) is the only nondecreasing
sequence of natural numbers such that n appears exactly G(n) times in the
sequence. The values of G(n) for the first few n are




You are given that G(10^3) = 86, G(10^6) = 6137.  
You are also given that ∑ G(n^3) = 153506976 for 1 ≤ n  10^3.

Find ∑ G(n^3) for 1 ≤ n  10^6.
