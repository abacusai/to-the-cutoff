N trolls are in a hole that is D_N cm deep. The n-th troll is
characterized by:

  * the distance from his feet to his shoulders in cm, h_n
  * the length of his arms in cm, l_n
  * his IQ (Irascibility Quotient), q_n.

Trolls can pile up on top of each other, with each troll standing on the
shoulders of the one below him. A troll can climb out of the hole and escape
if his hands can reach to the surface. Once a troll escapes he cannot
participate any further in the escaping effort.

The trolls execute an optimal strategy for maximizing the total IQ of the
escaping trolls, defined as Q(N).

Let  
r_n = [ ( 5^n  (10^9 + 7) )  101 ] + 50  
h_n = r_3n  
l_n = r_3n+1  
q_n = r_3n+2  
D_N = 1/√(2)∑_n=0^N-1 h_n.

For example, the first troll (n=0) is 51cm tall to his shoulders, has 55cm
long arms, and has an IQ of 75.

You are given that Q(5) = 401 and Q(15)=941.

Find Q(1000).
