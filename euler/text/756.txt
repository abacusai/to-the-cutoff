Consider a function f(k) defined for all positive integers k>0. Let S be
the sum of the first n values of f. That is,

    S=f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+⋯+f(n)=∑_k=1^n f(k).


In this problem, we employ randomness to approximate this sum. That is, we
choose a random, uniformly distributed, m-tuple of positive integers
(X_1,X_2,X_3,⋯,X_m) such that 0=X_0  X_1  X_2 ⋯ X_m
≤ n and calculate a modified sum S^* as follows. 
    S^* = ∑_i=1^m
    f(X_i)(X_i-X_i-1)


We now define the error of this approximation to be Δ=S-S^*.

Let 𝔼(Δ|f(k),n,m) be the expected value of the error given the
function f(k), the number of terms n in the sum and the length of random
sample m.

For example, 𝔼(Δ|k,100,50) = 2525/1326 ≈ 1.904223 and
𝔼(Δ|φ(k),10^4,10^2)≈ 5842.849907, where
φ(k) is Euler's totient function.

Find 𝔼(Δ|φ(k),12345678,12345) rounded to six places
after the decimal point.
