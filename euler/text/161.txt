Any n by m grid for which n Ã— m is divisible by 3 can be tiled

If we consider tilings that can be obtained by reflection or rotation from
another tiling as different there are 41 ways a 2 by 9 grid can be tiled
with triominoes:

In how many ways can a 9 by 12 grid be tiled in this way by triominoes?
