For an integer n, we define the square prime factors of n to be the primes
whose square divides n. For example, the square prime factors of 1500=2^2
× 3 × 5^3 are 2 and 5.

Let C_k(N) be the number of integers between 1 and N inclusive with
exactly k square prime factors. It can be shown that with growing N the
ratio C_k(N)/N gets arbitrarily close to a constant
c_k^∞, as suggested by the table below.


 Find c_7^∞.
Give the result in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits,
using a e to separate mantissa and exponent. E.g. if the answer were
0.000123456789, then the answer format would be 1.2346e-4.
