A 10-substring of a number is a substring of its digits that sum to 10.
For example, the 10-substrings of the number 3523014 are:

  * **_352_** 3014
  * 3 ** _523_** 014
  * 3 ** _5230_** 14
  * 35 ** _23014_**

A number is called 10-substring-friendly if every one of its digits belongs
to a 10-substring. For example, 3523014 is 10-substring-friendly, but
28546 is not.

Let T(n) be the number of 10-substring-friendly numbers from 1 to 10^n
(inclusive).  
For example T(2) = 9 and T(5) = 3492.

Find T(10^18)  1 000 000 007.
