For an n-tuple of integers t = (a_1, …, a_n), let (x_1, …, x_n)
be the solutions of the polynomial equation x^n + a_1 x^n-1 + a_2 x^n-2 +
⋯ + a_n-1x + a_n = 0.

Consider the following two conditions:

  * x_1, …, x_n are all real. 
  * If x_1, …, x_n are sorted, ⌊ x_i⌋ = i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. (⌊·⌋: floor function.) 

In the case of n = 4, there are 12 n-tuples of integers which satisfy
both conditions.  
We define S(t) as the sum of the absolute values of the integers in t.  
For n = 4 we can verify that ∑ S(t) = 2087 for all n-tuples t which
satisfy both conditions.

Find ∑ S(t) for n = 7.
