Consider the following Diophantine equation: 
    16x^2+y^4=z^2
 where x, y
and z are positive integers.

Let S(N) = ∑(x+y+z) where the sum is over all solutions
(x,y,z) such that 1 ≤ x,y,z ≤ N and (x,y,z)=1.

For N=100, there are only two such solutions: (3,4,20) and (10,3,41). So
S(10^2)=81.

You are also given that S(10^4)=112851 (with 26 solutions), and
S(10^7)≡ 248876211 10^9.

Find S(10^16). Give your answer modulo 10^9.
