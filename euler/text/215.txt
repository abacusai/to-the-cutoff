Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2 × 1 and 3 × 1
bricks (horizontal×vertical dimensions) such that, for
extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in
consecutive layers, i.e. never form a "running crack".

For example, the following 9 × 3 wall is not acceptable due to the
running crack shown in red:

There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9 × 3 wall, written
W(9,3) = 8.

Calculate W(32,10).
