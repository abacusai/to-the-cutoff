An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive
integers: 
    0.123456789101112131415161718192021⋯


It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.

If d_n represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of
the following expression. 
    d_1 × d_10× d_100× d_1000× d_10000× d_100000× d_1000000
