Given a fixed real number c, define a random sequence (X_n)_n≥ 0 by
the following random process:

  * X_0 = c (with probability 1).
  * For n>0, X_n = U_n X_n-1 where U_n is a real number chosen at random between zero and one, uniformly, and independently of all previous choices (U_m)_m<n.

If we desire there to be precisely a 25
this can be arranged by fixing c such that log_10 c ≈ 46.27.

Suppose now that c is set to a different value, so that there is precisely a
25

Find log_10 c and give your answer rounded to two places after the
decimal point.
