Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula: P_n =  12n(3n-1)
giving the sequence:


    1,5,12,22,35, 51,70,92,â€¦


Some pentagonal numbers can be expressed as the sum of two other pentagonal
numbers.  
For example:


    P_8 = 92 = 22 + 70 = P_4 + P_7


3577 is the smallest pentagonal number that can be expressed as the sum of two
pentagonal numbers in two different ways


    P_49 = 3577     = 3432 + 145 = P_48 + P_10
             = 3290 +
        287 = P_47+P_14


107602 is the smallest pentagonal number that can be expressed as the sum of
two pentagonal numbers in three different ways.

Find the smallest pentagonal number that can be expressed as the sum of two
pentagonal numbers in over 100 different ways.
