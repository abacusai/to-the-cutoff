Let S_n be the regular n-sided polygon – or shape – whose vertices v_k
(k = 1, 2, …, n) have coordinates:


    x_k    = cos((2k - 1)/n × 180^∘)
     y_k    = sin((2k -
    1)/n × 180^∘)


Each S_n is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points on
the perimeter and in the interior.

The **Minkowski sum** , S + T, of two shapes S and T is the result of
adding every point in S to every point in T, where point addition is
performed coordinate-wise: (u, v) + (x, y) = (u + x, v + y).

For example, the sum of S_3 and S_4 is the six-sided shape shown in pink
below:

How many sides does S_1864 + S_1865 + ⋯ + S_1909 have?
