The positive integral solutions of the equation x^y=y^x are (2,4), (4,2)
and (k,k) for all k > 0.

For a given positive integer n, let f(n) be the number of integral values
0 < x,y ≤ n^2-n such that 
    x^y≡ y^x  n.
 For example,
f(5)=104 and f(97)=1614336.

Let S(M,N)=∑ f(p) where the sum is taken over all primes p satisfying
M≤ p≤ N.

You are given S(1,10^2)=7381000 and S(1,10^5) ≡ 701331986
993353399.

Find S(10^16, 10^16+10^6). Give your answer modulo 993353399.
