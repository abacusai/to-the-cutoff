Let f(n) represent the number of ways one can fill a 3 × 3 × n
tower with blocks of 2 × 1 × 1.  
You're allowed to rotate the blocks in any way you like; however, rotations,
reflections etc of the tower itself are counted as distinct.

For example (with q = 100000007):  
f(2) = 229,  
f(4) = 117805,  
f(10)  q = 96149360,  
f(10^3)  q = 24806056,  
f(10^6)  q = 30808124.

Find f(10^10000)  100000007.
