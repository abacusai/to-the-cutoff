Let d_n(x) be the nth decimal digit of the fractional part of x, or 0
if the fractional part has fewer than n digits.

For example:

  * d_7 ( 1 ) = d_7 ( 1/2) = d_7 ( 1/4) = d_7 ( 1/5) = 0
  * d_7 ( 1/3) = 3 since 1/3 = 0.3333333333...
  * d_7 ( 1/6) = 6 since 1/6 = 0.1666666666...
  * d_7 ( 1/7) = 1 since 1/7 = 0.1428571428...

Let S(n) = âˆ‘_k=1^n d_n ( 1/k).

You are given:

  * S(7) = 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 1 = 10
  * S(100) = 418

Find S(10^7).
