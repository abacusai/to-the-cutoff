There is a grid of length and width 50515093 points. A clock is placed on each
grid point. The clocks are all analogue showing a single hour hand initially
pointing at 12.

A sequence S_t is created where: 
    S_0    = 290797
         S_t    =
        S_t-1^2  50515093    t>0
 The four numbers N_t =
(S_4t-4, S_4t-3, S_4t-2, S_4t-1) represent a range within the grid,
with the first pair of numbers representing the x-bounds and the second pair
representing the y-bounds. For example, if N_t = (3,9,47,20), the range
would be 3≤ x≤ 9 and 20≤ y≤47, and would include 196 clocks.

For each t (t>0), the clocks within the range represented by N_t are
moved to the next hour 12→ 1→ 2→⋯.

We define C(t) to be the sum of the hours that the clock hands are pointing
to after timestep t.  
You are given C(0) = 30621295449583788, C(1) = 30613048345941659, C(10) =
21808930308198471 and C(100) = 16190667393984172.

Find C(10^5).
