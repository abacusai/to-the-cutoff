We use x⊕ y for the bitwise XOR of x and y.

Define the XOR-product of x and y, denoted by x ⊗ y, similar to a
long multiplication in base 2, except that the intermediate results are
XORed instead of the usual integer addition.

For example, 7 ⊗ 3 = 9, or in base 2, 111_2 ⊗ 11_2 = 1001_2:


    ⊗ 111 111_2 
         ⊗1111 11_2
        
         ⊗ 111 111_2 
         ⊕11 111_2
        9
         ⊗ 11 1001_2


An XOR-prime is an integer n greater than 1 that is not an XOR-product of
two integers greater than 1. The above example shows that 9 is not an XOR-
prime. Similarly, 5 = 3 ⊗ 3 is not an XOR-prime. The first few XOR-
primes are 2, 3, 7, 11, 13, ... and the 10th XOR-prime is 41.

Find the 5 000 000th XOR-prime.
