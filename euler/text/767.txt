A window into a matrix is a contiguous sub matrix.

Consider a 16× n matrix where every entry is either 0 or 1. Let
B(k,n) be the total number of these matrices such that the sum of the
entries in every 2× k window is k.

You are given that B(2,4) = 65550 and B(3,9) ≡ 87273560
1 000 000 007.

Find B(10^5,10^16). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
