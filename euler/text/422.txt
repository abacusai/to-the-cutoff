Let H be the hyperbola defined by the equation 12x^2 + 7xy - 12y^2 = 625.

Next, define X as the point (7, 1). It can be seen that X is in H.

Now we define a sequence of points in H, P_i: i â‰¥ 1, as:

  * P_1 = (13, 61/4). 
  * P_2 = (-43/6, -4). 
  * For i  2, P_i is the unique point in H that is different from P_i-1 and such that line P_iP_i-1 is parallel to line P_i-2X. It can be shown that P_i is well-defined, and that its coordinates are always rational.

You are given that P_3 = (-19/2, -229/24), P_4 = (1267/144, -37/12) and
P_7 = (17194218091/143327232, 274748766781/1719926784).

Find P_n for n = 11^14 in the following format:  
If P_n = (a/b, c/d) where the fractions are in lowest terms and the
denominators are positive, then the answer is (a + b + c + d) 
1 000 000 007.

For n = 7, the answer would have been: 806236837.
