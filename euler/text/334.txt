In Plato's heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight line.  
Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.  
A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two beans
from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls.  
The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.

For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans
respectively, all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will
finish the game:

You are given the following sequences:  

#1font-family:inherit;#1 t_0    = 123456,     t_i    =   t_i-1/2,   if t_i-1 is even⌊t_i-1/2⌋⊕ 926252,   if
    t_i-1 is odd       where ⌊
    x⌋ is the floor function        
    !and
    ⊕is the bitwise XOR operator.     b_i    =
    (t_i2^11) + 1.

The first two terms of the last sequence are b_1 = 289 and b_2 = 145.  
If we start with b_1 and b_2 beans in two adjacent bowls, 3419100 moves
would be required to finish the game.

Consider now 1500 adjacent bowls containing b_1, b_2, …, b_1500
beans respectively, all other bowls being empty. Find how many moves it takes
before the game ends.
