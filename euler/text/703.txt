Given an integer n, n ≥ 3, let B=
false,true
and let B^n be the set of sequences of n values from B. The function f
from B^n to B^n is defined by f(b_1 … b_n) = c_1 … c_n where:

  * c_i = b_i+1 for 1 ≤ i < n.
  * c_n = b_1  AND  (b_2  XOR  b_3), where AND and XOR are the logical AND and exclusive OR operations.

Let S(n) be the number of functions T from B^n to B such that for all
x in B^n, T(x)  AND  T(f(x)) = false. You are given
that S(3) = 35 and S(4) = 2118.

Find S(20). Give your answer modulo 1 001 001 011.
