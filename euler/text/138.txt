Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, b = 16, and legs, L =
17.

By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the
triangle, h = √(17^2 - 8^2) = 15, which is one less than the base
length.

With b = 272 and L = 305, we get h = 273, which is one more than the
base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with the
property that h = b ± 1.

Find ∑ L for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which h = b ±
1 and b, L are positive integers.
