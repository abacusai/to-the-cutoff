A positive integer matrix is a matrix whose elements are all positive
integers.  
Some positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a positive
integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:


    [ 40 12; 48 40 ] = [  2  3; 12  2 ]^2 = [ 6 1; 4 6 ]^2


We define F(N) as the number of the 2Ã— 2 positive integer matrices
which have a **trace the sum of the elements on the main diagonal** less than
N and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two
different ways.  
We can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.

Find F(10^7).
