A composite number can be factored many different ways. For instance, not
including multiplication by one, 24 can be factored in 7 distinct ways:


    24    = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3
     24    = 2 × 3 ×
    4
     24    = 2 × 2 × 6
     24    = 4 × 6
     24    = 3 × 8
     24
       = 2 × 12
     24    = 24


Recall that the digital root of a number, in base 10, is found by adding
together the digits of that number, and repeating that process until a number
is arrived at that is less than 10. Thus the digital root of 467 is 8.

We shall call a Digital Root Sum (DRS) the sum of the digital roots of the
individual factors of our number.  
The chart below demonstrates all of the DRS values for 24.

Factorisation| Digital Root Sum  
—|—  
2 × 2 × 2 × 3| 9  
2 × 3 × 4| 9  
2 × 2 × 6| 10  
4 × 6| 10  
3 × 8| 11  
2 × 12| 5  
24| 6  
  
The maximum Digital Root Sum of 24 is 11.  
The function mdrs(n) gives the maximum Digital Root Sum of
n. So mdrs(24)=11.  
Find ∑mdrs(n) for 1  n  1 000 000.
