Define Q(n) to be the smallest number that occurs in exactly n
**Pythagorean triples** (a,b,c) where a  b  c.

For example, 15 is the smallest number occurring in exactly 5 Pythagorean
triples: 
    (9,12,15)   (8,15,17)  
    (15,20,25)   (15,36,39)   (15,112,113)
 and
so Q(5) = 15.

You are also given Q(10)=48 and Q(10^3)=8064000.

Find âˆ‘_k=1^18 Q(10^k). Give your answer modulo
409120391.
