Let F(N) be the maximum number of lattice points in an axis-aligned N×
N square that the graph of a single **strictly convex** increasing function
can pass through.

You are given that F(1) = 2, F(3) = 3, F(9) = 6, F(11) = 7, F(100) =
30 and F(50000) = 1898.  
Below is the graph of a function reaching the maximum 3 for N=3:
