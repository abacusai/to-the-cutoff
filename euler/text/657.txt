In the context of **formal languages** , any finite sequence of letters of a
given **alphabet** Σ is called a **word** over Σ. We call a word
incomplete if it does not contain every letter of Σ.

For example, using the alphabet Σ=
 a, b, c, 'ab', 'abab' and
'' (the empty word) are incomplete words over Σ, while 'abac' is
a complete word over Σ.

Given an alphabet Σ of α letters, we define I(α,n) to be
the number of incomplete words over Σ with a length not exceeding n.  
For example, I(3,0)=1, I(3,2)=13 and I(3,4)=79.

Find I(10^7,10^12). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
