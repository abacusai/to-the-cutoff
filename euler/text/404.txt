E_a is an ellipse with an equation of the form x^2 + 4y^2 = 4a^2.  
E_a^' is the rotated image of E_a by θ degrees
counterclockwise around the origin O(0, 0) for 0^∘θ
90^∘.

b is the distance to the origin of the two intersection points closest to
the origin and c is the distance of the two other intersection points.  
We call an ordered triplet (a, b, c) a canonical ellipsoidal triplet if a,
b and c are positive integers.  
For example, (209, 247, 286) is a canonical ellipsoidal triplet.

Let C(N) be the number of distinct canonical ellipsoidal triplets (a, b,
c) for a ≤ N.  
It can be verified that C(10^3) = 7, C(10^4) = 106 and C(10^6) = 11845.

Find C(10^17).
