For any prime p the number N(p, q) is defined by N(p, q) = ∑_n = 0^q
T_n · p^n  
with T_n generated by the following random number generator:

S_0 = 290797  
S_n + 1 = S_n^2  50515093  
T_n = S_n  p

Let Nfac(p, q) be the factorial of N(p, q).  
Let NF(p, q) be the number of factors p in
Nfac(p, q).

You are given that NF(3,10000)  3^20 = 624955285.

Find NF(61, 10^7)  61^10.
