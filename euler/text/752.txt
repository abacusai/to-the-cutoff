When (1+√(7)) is raised to an integral power, n, we always get a number
of the form (a+b√(7)).  
We write (1+√(7))^n = α(n) + β(n)√(7).

For a given number x we define g(x) to be the smallest positive integer
n such that: 
    α(n)    ≡ 1  x    and
        
         β(n)    ≡ 0  x
 and g(x) = 0 if there is no
such value of n. For example, g(3) = 0, g(5) = 12.

Further define 
    G(N) = ∑_x=2^N g(x)
 You are given G(10^2) = 28891
and G(10^3) = 13131583.

Find G(10^6).
