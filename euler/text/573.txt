n runners in very different training states want to compete in a race. Each
one of them is given a different starting number k (1≤ k ≤ n)
according to the runner's (constant) individual racing speed being
v_k=k/n.  
In order to give the slower runners a chance to win the race, n different
starting positions are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) and
independently from each other within the racing track of length 1. After
this, the starting position nearest to the goal is assigned to runner 1, the
next nearest starting position to runner 2 and so on, until finally the
starting position furthest away from the goal is assigned to runner n. The
winner of the race is the runner who reaches the goal first.

Interestingly, the expected running time for the winner is 1/2,
independently of the number of runners. Moreover, while it can be shown that
all runners will have the same expected running time of n/n+1, the
race is still unfair, since the winning chances may differ significantly for
different starting numbers:

Let P_n,k be the probability for runner k to win a race with n runners
and E_n = ∑_k=1^n k P_n,k be the expected starting number of the
winner in that race. It can be shown that, for example, P_3,1=4/9,
P_3,2=2/9, P_3,3=1/3 and E_3=17/9 for a race
with 3 runners.  
You are given that E_4=2.21875, E_5=2.5104 and E_10=3.66021568.

Find E_1000000 rounded to 4 digits after the decimal point.
