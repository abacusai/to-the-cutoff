Let T(r) be the number of integer quadruplets x, y, z, t such that x^2 +
y^2 + z^2 + t^2 â‰¤ r^2. In other words, T(r) is the number of lattice
points in the four-dimensional hyperball of radius r.

You are given that T(2) = 89, T(5) = 3121, T(100) = 493490641 and
T(10^4) = 49348022079085897.

Find T(10^8)  1000000007.
