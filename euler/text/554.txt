On a chess board, a centaur moves like a king or a knight. The diagram below
shows the valid moves of a centaur (represented by an inverted king) on an 8
× 8 board.

It can be shown that at most n^2 non-attacking centaurs can be placed on a
board of size 2n × 2n.  
Let C(n) be the number of ways to place n^2 centaurs on a 2n × 2n
board so that no centaur attacks another directly.  
For example C(1) = 4, C(2) = 25, C(10) = 1477721.

Let F_i be the ith Fibonacci number defined as F_1 = F_2 = 1 and F_i =
F_i - 1 + F_i - 2 for i  2.

Find ( ∑_i=2^90 C(F_i) )  (10^8+7).
