Let R^2 be the set of pairs of real numbers (x, y). Let π =
3.14159⋯.

Consider the function f from R^2 to R^2 defined by f(x, y) =
(x^2 - x - y^2, 2xy - y + π), and its n-th iterated composition
f^(n)(x, y) = f(f(⋯ f(x, y)⋯)). For example f^(3)(x, y) =
f(f(f(x, y))). A pair (x, y) is said to have period n if n is the
smallest positive integer such that f^(n)(x, y) = (x, y).

Let P(n) denote the sum of x-coordinates of all points having period not
exceeding n. Interestingly, P(n) is always an integer. For example, P(1)
= 2, P(2) = 2, P(3) = 4.

Find P(10^7) and give your answer modulo 1 020 340 567.
