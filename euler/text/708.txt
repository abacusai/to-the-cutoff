A positive integer, n, is factorised into prime factors. We define f(n) to
be the product when each prime factor is replaced with 2. In addition we
define f(1)=1.

For example, 90 = 2× 3× 3× 5, then replacing the primes,
2× 2× 2× 2 = 16, hence f(90) = 16.

Let S(N)=∑_n=1^N f(n). You are given
S(10^8)=9613563919.

Find S(10^14).
