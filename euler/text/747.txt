Mamma Triangolo baked a triangular pizza. She wants to cut the pizza into n
pieces. She first chooses a point P in the interior (not boundary) of the
triangle pizza, and then performs n cuts, which all start from P and
extend straight to the boundary of the pizza so that the n pieces are all
triangles and all have the same area.

Let ψ(n) be the number of different ways for Mamma Triangolo to cut the
pizza, subject to the constraints.  
For example, ψ(3)=7.

Also ψ(6)=34, and ψ(10)=90.

Let Ψ(m)=∑_n=3^m ψ(n). You are given Ψ(10)=345
and Ψ(1000)=172166601.

Find Ψ(10^8). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
