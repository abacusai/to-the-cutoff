We want to tile a board of length n and height 1 completely, with either
1 × 2 blocks or 1 × 1 blocks with a single decimal digit on top:

For example, here are some of the ways to tile a board of length n = 8:

Let T(n) be the number of ways to tile a board of length n as described
above.

For example, T(1) = 10 and T(2) = 101.

Let S(L) be the triple sum ∑_a, b, c(T(c^a), T(c^b)) for 1 ≤
a, b, c ≤ L.  
For example:  
S(2) = 10444  
S(3) = 1292115238446807016106539989  
S(4)  987 898 789 = 670616280.

Find S(2000)  987 898 789.
