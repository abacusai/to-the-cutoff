We create an array of points P_n in a two dimensional plane using the
following random number generator:  
s_0=290797  
s_n+1=s_n^2  50515093  
  
P_n=(s_2n,s_2n+1)

Let d(k) be the shortest distance of any two (distinct) points among P_0,
â‹¯, P_k - 1.  
E.g. d(14)=546446.466846479.

Find d(2000000). Give your answer rounded to 9 places after the decimal
point.
