Consider the infinite polynomial series A_G(x) = x G_1 + x^2 G_2 + x^3 G_3 +
⋯, where G_k is the kth term of the second order recurrence relation
G_k = G_k-1 + G_k-2, G_1 = 1 and G_2 = 4; that is, 1, 4, 5, 9, 14,
23, ….

For this problem we shall be concerned with values of x for which A_G(x)
is a positive integer.

The corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are shown
below.

x| A_G(x)  
—|—  
√(5)-1/4| 1  
25| 2  
√(22)-2/6| 3  
√(137)-5/14| 4  
12| 5  
  
We shall call A_G(x) a golden nugget if x is rational, because they become
increasingly rarer; for example, the 20th golden nugget is 211345365.

Find the sum of the first thirty golden nuggets.
