For integers a and b, we define D(a, b) as the domain enclosed by the
parabola y = x^2 and the line y = a· x + b:  
D(a, b) = 
(x, y) | x^2 ≤ y ≤ a· x + b.

L(a, b) is defined as the number of lattice points contained in D(a, b).  
For example, L(1, 2) = 8 and L(2, -1) = 1.

We also define S(N) as the sum of L(a, b) for all the pairs (a, b) such
that the area of D(a, b) is a rational number and |a|,|b| ≤ N.  
We can verify that S(5) = 344 and S(100) = 26709528.

Find S(10^12). Give your answer mod 10^8.
