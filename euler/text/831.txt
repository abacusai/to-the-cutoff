Let g(m) be the integer defined by the following double sum of products of
binomial coefficients:


    ∑_j=0^m∑_i = 0^j (-1)^j-i mj  ji
    j+5+6ij+5.


You are given that g(10) = 127278262644918.  
Its first (most significant) five digits are 12727.  
Find the first ten digits of g(142857) when written in base 7.
