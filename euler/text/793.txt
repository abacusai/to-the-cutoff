Let S_i be an integer sequence produced with the following pseudo-random
number generator:

  * S_0 = 290797
  * S_i+1 = S_i ^2  50515093

Let M(n) be the median of the pairwise products S_i S_j for 0 â‰¤ i 
j  n.

You are given M(3) = 3878983057768 and M(103) = 492700616748525.

Find M(1 000 003).
