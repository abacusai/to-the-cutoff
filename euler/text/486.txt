Let F_5(n) be the number of strings s such that:

  * s consists only of '0's and '1's, 
  * s has length at most n, and 
  * s contains a palindromic substring of length at least 5. 

For example, F_5(4) = 0, F_5(5) = 8, F_5(6) = 42 and F_5(11) = 3844.

Let D(L) be the number of integers n such that 5 ≤ n ≤ L and
F_5(n) is divisible by 87654321.

For example, D(10^7) = 0 and D(5 · 10^9) = 51.

Find D(10^18).
