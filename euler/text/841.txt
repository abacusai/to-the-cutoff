The regular star polygon p/q, for coprime integers p,q with p 
2q  0, is a polygon formed from p edges of equal length and equal
internal angles, such that tracing the complete polygon wraps q times around
the centre. For example, 8/3 is illustrated below:

The edges of a regular star polygon intersect one another, dividing the
interior into several regions. Define the alternating shading of a regular
star polygon to be a selection of such regions to shade, such that every piece
of every edge has a shaded region on one side and an unshaded region on the
other, with the exterior of the polygon unshaded. For example, the above image
shows the alternating shading (in green) of 8/3.

Let A(p, q) be the area of the alternating shading of p/q, assuming
that its inradius is 1. (The **inradius** of a regular polygon, star or
otherwise, is the distance from its centre to the midpoint of any of its
edges.) For example, in the diagram above, it can be shown that central shaded
octagon has area 8(√(2)-1) and each point's shaded kite has area
2(√(2)-1), giving A(8,3) = 24(√(2)-1) ≈ 9.9411254970.

You are also given that A(130021, 50008)≈ 10.9210371479, rounded to
10 digits after the decimal point.

Find ∑_n=3^34 A(F_n+1,F_n-1), where F_j is the Fibonacci
sequence with F_1=F_2=1 (so A(F_5+1,F_5-1) = A(8,3)). Give your answer
rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.
