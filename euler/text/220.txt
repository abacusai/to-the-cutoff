Let **_D_** 0 be the two-letter string "Fa". For n≥1, derive **_D_** n from
**_D_** n-1 by the string-rewriting rules:

"a" → "aRbFR"  
"b" → "LFaLb"

Thus, **_D_** 0 = "Fa", **_D_** 1 = "FaRbFR", **_D_** 2 = "FaRbFRRLFaLbFR",
and so on.

These strings can be interpreted as instructions to a computer graphics
program, with "F" meaning "draw forward one unit", "L" meaning "turn left 90
degrees", "R" meaning "turn right 90 degrees", and "a" and "b" being ignored.
The initial position of the computer cursor is (0,0), pointing up towards
(0,1).

Then **_D_** n is an exotic drawing known as the _Heighway Dragon_ of order
_n_. For example, **_D_** 10 is shown below; counting each "F" as one step,
the highlighted spot at (18,16) is the position reached after 500 steps.

What is the position of the cursor after 1012 steps in **_D_** 50 ?  
Give your answer in the form _x_ , _y_ with no spaces.
