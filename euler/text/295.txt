We call the convex area enclosed by two circles a lenticular hole if:

  * The centres of both circles are on lattice points.
  * The two circles intersect at two distinct lattice points.
  * The interior of the convex area enclosed by both circles does not contain any lattice points. 

Consider the circles:  
C_0: x^2 + y^2 = 25  
C_1: (x + 4)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 1  
C_2: (x - 12)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 65

The circles C_0, C_1 and C_2 are drawn in the picture below.

C_0 and C_1 form a lenticular hole, as well as C_0 and C_2.

We call an ordered pair of positive real numbers (r_1, r_2) a lenticular
pair if there exist two circles with radii r_1 and r_2 that form a
lenticular hole. We can verify that (1, 5) and (5, √(65)) are the
lenticular pairs of the example above.

Let L(N) be the number of **distinct** lenticular pairs (r_1, r_2) for
which 0  r_1 ≤ r_2 ≤ N.  
We can verify that L(10) = 30 and L(100) = 3442.

Find L(100 000).
