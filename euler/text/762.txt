Consider a two dimensional grid of squares. The grid has 4 rows but infinitely
many columns.

An amoeba in square (x, y) can divide itself into two amoebas to occupy the
squares (x+1,y) and (x+1,(y+1)  4), provided these squares are empty.

The following diagrams show two cases of an amoeba placed in square **A** of
each grid. When it divides, it is replaced with two amoebas, one at each of
the squares marked with **B** :

Originally there is only one amoeba in the square (0, 0). After N
divisions there will be N+1 amoebas arranged in the grid. An arrangement may
be reached in several different ways but it is only counted once. Let C(N)
be the number of different possible arrangements after N divisions.

For example, C(2) = 2, C(10) = 1301, C(20)=5895236 and the last nine
digits of C(100) are 125923036.

Find C(100 000), enter the last nine digits as your answer.
