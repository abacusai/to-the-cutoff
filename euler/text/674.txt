We define the ℐ operator as the function 
 and ℐ-expressions as arithmetic expressions built
only from variable names and applications of ℐ. A variable name
may consist of one or more letters. For example, the three expressions x,
ℐ(x,y), and ℐ(ℐ(x,ab),x) are all
ℐ-expressions.

For two ℐ-expressions e_1 and e_2 such that the equation
e_1=e_2 has a solution in non-negative integers, we define the least
simultaneous value of e_1 and e_2 to be the minimum value taken by e_1
and e_2 on such a solution. If the equation e_1=e_2 has no solution in
non-negative integers, we define the least simultaneous value of e_1 and
e_2 to be 0. For example, consider the following three
ℐ-expressions: 
 The least simultaneous value of
A and B is 23, attained for x=3,y=1,z=t=0. On the other hand, A=C
has no solutions in non-negative integers, so the least simultaneous value of
A and C is 0. The total sum of least simultaneous pairs made of
ℐ-expressions from A,B,C is 26.

Find the sum of least simultaneous values of all ℐ-expressions
pairs made of distinct expressions from file
[I-expressions.txt](project/resources/p674_i_expressions.txt) (pairs
(e_1,e_2) and (e_2,e_1) are considered to be identical). Give the last
nine digits of the result as the answer.
