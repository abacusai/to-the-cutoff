For some fixed ρ∈ [0, 1], we begin a sum s at 0 and repeatedly
apply a process: With probability ρ, we add 1 to s, otherwise we add
2 to s.

The process ends when either s is a perfect square or s exceeds 10^18,
whichever occurs first. For example, if s goes through 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9,
the process ends at s=9, and two squares 1 and 4 were skipped over.

Let f(ρ) be the expected number of perfect squares skipped over when the
process finishes.

It can be shown that the power series for f(ρ) is ∑_k=0^∞ a_k
ρ^k for a suitable (unique) choice of coefficients a_k. Some of the
first few coefficients are a_0=1, a_1=0, a_5=-18, a_10=45176.

Let F(n) = ∑_k=0^n a_k. You are given that F(10) = 53964 and F(50)
≡ 842418857 10^9.

Find F(1000), and give your answer modulo 10^9.
