Let σ(n) be the sum of all the divisors of the positive integer n,
for example:  
σ(10) = 1+2+5+10 = 18.

Define T(N) to be the sum of all numbers n ≤ N such that when the
fraction σ(n)/n is written in its lowest form a/b, the
denominator is a power of 3 i.e. b = 3^k, k > 0.

You are given T(100) = 270 and T(10^6) = 26089287.

Find T(10^14).
