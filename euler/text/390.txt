Consider the triangle with sides √(5), √(65) and √(68). It
can be shown that this triangle has area 9.

S(n) is the sum of the areas of all triangles with sides √(1+b^2),
√(1+c^2) and √(b^2+c^2) (for positive integers b and c)
that have an integral area not exceeding n.

The example triangle has b=2 and c=8.

S(10^6)=18018206.

Find S(10^10).
