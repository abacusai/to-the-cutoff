A **Gaussian integer** is a number z = a + bi where a, b are integers
and i^2 = -1.  
Gaussian integers are a subset of the complex numbers, and the integers are
the subset of Gaussian integers for which b = 0.

A Gaussian integer **unit** is one for which a^2 + b^2 = 1, i.e. one of 1,
i, -1, -i.  
Let's define a proper Gaussian integer as one for which a  0 and b ≥
0.

A Gaussian integer z_1 = a_1 + b_1 i is said to be divisible by z_2 = a_2 +
b_2 i if z_3 = a_3 + b_3 i = z_1 / z_2 is a Gaussian integer.  
z_1/z_2 = a_1 + b_1 i/a_2 + b_2 i = (a_1 + b_1
i)(a_2 - b_2 i)/(a_2 + b_2 i)(a_2 - b_2 i) = a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2/a_2^2 + b_2^2 + a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2/a_2^2 + b_2^2i = a_3 + b_3 i  
So, z_1 is divisible by z_2 if a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2/a_2^2 + b_2^2
and a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2/a_2^2 + b_2^2 are integers.  
For example, 2 is divisible by 1 + i because 2/(1 + i) = 1 - i is a
Gaussian integer.

A **Gaussian prime** is a Gaussian integer that is divisible only by a unit,
itself or itself times a unit.  
For example, 1 + 2i is a Gaussian prime, because it is only divisible by
1, i, -1, -i, 1 + 2i, i(1 + 2i) = i - 2, -(1 + 2i) = -1 - 2i and
-i(1 + 2i) = 2 - i.  
2 is not a Gaussian prime as it is divisible by 1 + i.

A Gaussian integer can be uniquely factored as the product of a unit and
proper Gaussian primes.  
For example 2 = -i(1 + i)^2 and 1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i).  
A Gaussian integer is said to be squarefree if its prime factorization does
not contain repeated proper Gaussian primes.  
So 2 is not squarefree over the Gaussian integers, but 1 + 3i is.  
Units and Gaussian primes are squarefree by definition.

Let f(n) be the count of proper squarefree Gaussian integers with a^2 + b^2
≤ n.  
For example f(10) = 7 because 1, 1 + i, 1 + 2i, 1 + 3i = (1 + i)(1 +
2i), 2 + i, 3 and 3 + i = -i(1 + i)(1 + 2i) are squarefree, while 2 =
-i(1 + i)^2 and 2 + 2i = -i(1 + i)^3 are not.  
You are given f(10^2) = 54, f(10^4) = 5218 and f(10^8) = 52126906.

Find f(10^14).
