Construct triangle ABC such that:

  * Vertices A, B and C are lattice points inside or on the circle of radius r centered at the origin;
  * the triangle contains no other lattice point inside or on its edges;
  * the perimeter is maximum.

Let R be the circumradius of triangle ABC and T(r) = R/r.  
For r = 5, one possible triangle has vertices (-4,-3), (4,2) and (1,0)
with perimeter √(13)+√(34)+√(89) and circumradius R = √(19669/2), so T(5) = √(19669/50).  
You are given T(10) ≈ 97.26729 and T(100) ≈ 9157.64707.

Find T(10^7). Give your answer rounded to the nearest integer.
