A non-decreasing sequence of integers a_n can be generated from any positive
real value θ by the following procedure: 
    b_1    = θ
     b_n    = ⌊ b_n-1⌋(b_n-1 -
    ⌊ b_n-1⌋ + 1)   ∀  n ≥ 2 
     a_n    =
    ⌊ b_n⌋
 Where ⌊·⌋ is the floor function.

For example, θ=2.956938891377988... generates the Fibonacci sequence:
2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

The _concatenation_ of a sequence of positive integers a_n is a real value
denoted τ constructed by concatenating the elements of the sequence after
the decimal point, starting at a_1: a_1.a_2a_3a_4...

For example, the Fibonacci sequence constructed from
θ=2.956938891377988... yields the concatenation
τ=2.3581321345589... Clearly, τ≠θ for this value of
θ.

Find the only value of θ for which the generated sequence starts at
a_1=2 and the concatenation of the generated sequence equals the original
value: τ = θ. Give your answer rounded to 24 places after the
decimal point.
