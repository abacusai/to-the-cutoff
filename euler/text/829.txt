Given any integer n  1 a binary factor tree T(n) is defined to be:

  * A tree with the single node n when n is prime.
  * A binary tree that has root node n, left subtree T(a) and right subtree T(b), when n is not prime. Here a and b are positive integers such that n = ab, a≤ b and b-a is the smallest.

For example T(20):

We define M(n) to be the smallest number that has a factor tree identical in
shape to the factor tree for n!!, the **double factorial** of n.

For example, consider 9!! = 9× 7× 5× 3× 1 = 945. The
factor tree for 945 is shown below together with the factor tree for 72
which is the smallest number that has a factor tree of the same shape. Hence
M(9) = 72.
