The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3 and 6.  
The sum of the squares of these numbers is 1+4+9+36=50.

Let sigma_2(n) represent the sum of the squares of the
divisors of n. Thus sigma_2(6)=50.

Let SIGMA_2 represent the summatory function of
sigma_2, that is SIGMA_2(n)=âˆ‘sigma_2(i) for i=1 to n.  
The first 6 values of SIGMA_2 are: 1,6,16,37,63 and
113.

Find SIGMA_2(10^15) modulo 10^9.
