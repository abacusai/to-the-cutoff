The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

> F_n = F_n - 1 + F_n - 2, where F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1.

Hence the first 12 terms will be:


    F_1    = 1
     F_2    = 1
     F_3    = 2
     F_4    = 3
     F_5    = 5
     F_6
       = 8
     F_7    = 13
     F_8    = 21
     F_9    = 34
     F_10   = 55
     F_11   = 89
    F_12   = 144


The 12th term, F_12, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain
1000 digits?
