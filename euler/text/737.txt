A game is played with many identical, round coins on a flat table.

Consider a line perpendicular to the table.  
The first coin is placed on the table touching the line.  
Then, one by one, the coins are placed horizontally on top of the previous
coin and touching the line.  
The complete stack of coins must be balanced after every placement.

The diagram below [not to scale] shows a possible placement of 8 coins where
point P represents the line.

It is found that a minimum of 31 coins are needed to form a _coin loop_
around the line, i.e. if in the projection of the coins on the table the
centre of the nth coin is rotated θ_n, about the line, from the
centre of the (n-1)th coin then the sum of ∑_k=2^n
θ_k is first larger than 360^∘ when n=31. In general, to loop
k times, n is the smallest number for which the sum is greater than
360^∘ k.

Also, 154 coins are needed to loop two times around the line, and 6947
coins to loop ten times.

Calculate the number of coins needed to loop 2020 times around the line.
