Let T(n, m) be the number of m-tuples of positive integers such that the
sum of any two neighbouring elements of the tuple is ≤ n.

For example, T(3, 4)=8, via the following eight 4-tuples:  
(1, 1, 1, 1)  
(1, 1, 1, 2)  
(1, 1, 2, 1)  
(1, 2, 1, 1)  
(1, 2, 1, 2)  
(2, 1, 1, 1)  
(2, 1, 1, 2)  
(2, 1, 2, 1)  

You are also given that T(5, 5)=246, T(10, 10^2) ≡ 862820094
1 000 000 007 and T(10^2, 10) ≡ 782136797
1 000 000 007.

Find T(5000, 10^12)  1 000 000 007.
