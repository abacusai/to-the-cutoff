n families, each with four members, a father, a mother, a son and a
daughter, were invited to a restaurant. They were all seated at a large
circular table with 4n seats such that men and women alternate.

Let M(n) be the number of ways the families can be seated such that none of
the families were seated together. A family is considered to be seated
together only when all the members of a family sit next to each other.

For example, M(1)=0, M(2)=896, M(3)=890880 and M(10) ≡ 170717180
1 000 000 007.

Let S(n)=∑_k=2^nM(k).

For example, S(10) ≡ 399291975 1 000 000 007.

Find S(2021). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
