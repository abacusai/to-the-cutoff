The Collatz sequence is defined as: a_i+1 = 
a_i/2 3 a_i+1if a_i is evenif a_i is
odd..

The Collatz conjecture states that starting from any positive integer, the
sequence eventually reaches the cycle1,4,2,1, ….  
We shall define the sequence prefixp(n)for the Collatz sequence starting
witha_1 = nas the sub-sequence of all numbers not a power of2(2^0=1is considered a power of2for this problem). For example:p(13) = 
13, 40, 20, 10, 5
p(8) = 

Any number invalidating the conjecture would have an infinite length sequence
prefix.

LetS_mbe the set of all sequence prefixes of lengthm. Two sequences
a_1, a_2, …, a_m
and
b_1, b_2, …, b_m
inS_mare
said to belong to the same prefix family ifa_i  a_jif and only ifb_i
 b_jfor all1 ≤ i,j ≤ m.

For example, inS_4,
6, 3, 10, 5
is in the same family as
454,
227, 682, 341
, but not
113, 340, 170, 85
.  
Letf(m)be the number of distinct prefix families inS_m.  
You are givenf(5) = 5,f(10) = 55,f(20) = 6771.

Findf(90).
