Let F(n) be the number of connected graphs with blue edges (directed) and
red edges (undirected) containing:

  * two vertices of degree 1, one with a single outgoing blue edge and the other with a single incoming blue edge.
  * n vertices of degree 3, each of which has an incoming blue edge, a **different** outgoing blue edge and a red edge.

For example, F(4)=5 because there are 5 graphs with these properties:

You are also given F(8)=319.

Find F(50 000). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.

NOTE: Feynman diagrams are a way of visualising the forces between elementary
particles. Vertices represent interactions. The blue edges in our diagrams
represent matter particles (e.g. electrons or positrons) with the arrow
representing the flow of charge. The red edges (normally wavy lines) represent
the force particles (e.g. photons). Feynman diagrams are used to predict the
strength of particle interactions.
