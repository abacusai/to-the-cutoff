For a positive integer n, let σ(n) be the sum of all divisors of n.
For example, σ(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.

A perfect number, as you probably know, is a number with σ(n) = 2n.

Let us define the **perfection quotient** of a positive integer as p(n) =
σ(n)n.

Find the sum of all positive integers n ≤ 10^18 for which p(n) has the
form k + 12, where k is an integer.
