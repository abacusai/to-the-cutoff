Given an odd prime p, put the numbers 1,...,p-1 into p-1/2 pairs
such that each number appears exactly once. Each pair (a,b) has a cost of
ab  p. For example, if p=5 the pair (3,4) has a cost of 12  5
= 2.

The _total cost_ of a pairing is the sum of the costs of its pairs. We say
that such pairing is optimal if its total cost is minimal for that p.

For example, if p = 5, then there is a unique optimal pairing: (1, 2), (3,
4), with total cost of 2 + 2 = 4.

The cost product of a pairing is the product of the costs of its pairs. For
example, the cost product of the optimal pairing for p = 5 is 2 Â· 2 =
4.

It turns out that all optimal pairings for p = 2 000 000 011 have the
same cost product.

Find the value of this product.
