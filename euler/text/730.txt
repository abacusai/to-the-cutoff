For a non-negative integer k, the triple (p,q,r) of positive integers is
called a k-shifted Pythagorean triple if 
    p^2 + q^2 + k = r^2


(p, q, r) is said to be primitive if (p, q, r)=1.

Let P_k(n) be the number of primitive k-shifted Pythagorean triples such
that 1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ r and p + q + r ≤ n.  
For example, P_0(10^4) = 703 and P_20(10^4) = 1979.

Define 
    S(m,n)=∑_k=0^mP_k(n).
 You are given that
S(10,10^4) = 10956.

Find S(10^2,10^8).
