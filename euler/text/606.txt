A **gozinta chain** for n is a sequence 1,a,b,â€¦,n where each
element properly divides the next.  
For example, there are eight distinct gozinta chains for 12:  
1,12, 1,2,12, 1,2,4,12, 1,2,6,12,
1,3,12, 1,3,6,12, 1,4,12 and 1,6,12.

Let S(n) be the sum of all numbers, k, not exceeding n, which have 252
distinct gozinta chains.  
You are given S(10^6)=8462952 and S(10^12)=623291998881978.

Find S(10^36), giving the last nine digits of your answer.
