Let f(N) be the smallest positive integer that is not coprime to any
positive integer n ≤ N whose least significant digit is 3.

For example f(40) equals to 897 = 3 · 13 · 23 since it is not
coprime to any of 3,13,23,33. By taking the **[natural
logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm)** (log to base
e) we obtain ln f(40) = ln 897 ≈ 6.799056 when rounded to six
digits after the decimal point.

You are also given ln f(2800) ≈ 715.019337.

Find f(10^6). Enter its natural logarithm rounded to six digits after the
decimal point.
