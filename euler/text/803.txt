**Rand48** is a pseudorandom number generator used by some programming
languages. It generates a sequence from any given integer 0 ≤ a_0 < 2^48
using the rule a_n = (25214903917 · a_n - 1 + 11)  2^48.

Let b_n = ⌊ a_n / 2^16⌋ 52. The sequence b_0, b_1,
… is translated to an infinite string c = c_0c_1… via the rule:  
0 → a, 1→ b, …, 25 → z, 26
→ A, 27 → B, …, 51 → Z.

For example, if we choose a_0 = 123456, then the string c starts with:
"bQYicNGCY…".  
Moreover, starting from index 100, we encounter the substring "RxqLBfWzv"
for the first time.

Alternatively, if c starts with "EULERcats…", then a_0 must be
78580612777175.

Now suppose that the string c starts with "PuzzleOne…".  
Find the starting index of the first occurrence of the substring "LuckyText"
in c.
