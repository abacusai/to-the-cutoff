Every divisor d of a number n has a **complementary divisor** n/d.

Let f(n) be the sum of the **greatest common divisor** of d and n/d over
all positive divisors d of n, that is f(n)=∑_d|
n(d,n/d).

Let F be the summatory function of f, that is
F(k)=∑_n=1^k f(n).

You are given that F(10)=32 and F(1000)=12776.

Find F(10^15).
