For any positive integer n the function next
_prime(n)
returns the smallest prime p such that p  n.

The sequence a(n) is defined by:  
a(1)=next
_prime(10^14) and
a(n)=next
_prime(a(n-1)) for n  1.

The Fibonacci sequence f(n) is defined by: f(0)=0, f(1)=1 and
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) for n  1.

The sequence b(n) is defined as f(a(n)).

Find ∑ b(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. Give your answer mod
1234567891011.
