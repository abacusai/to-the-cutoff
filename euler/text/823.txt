A list initially contains the numbers 2, 3, â€¦, n.  
At each round, every number in the list is divided by its smallest prime
factor. Then the product of these smallest prime factors is added to the list
as a new number. Finally, all numbers that become 1 are removed from the
list.

For example, below are the first three rounds for n = 5: 
    [2, 3, 4, 5]
     [2, 60]  [30, 4]  [15, 2,
    4].
 Let S(n, m) be the sum of all numbers in the list after m rounds.  
For example, S(5, 3) = 15 + 2 + 4 = 21. Also S(10, 100) = 257.

Find S(10^4, 10^16). Give your answer modulo 1234567891.
