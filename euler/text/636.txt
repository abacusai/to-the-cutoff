Consider writing a natural number as product of powers of natural numbers with
given exponents, additionally requiring different base numbers for each power.

For example, 256 can be written as a product of a square and a fourth power
in three ways such that the base numbers are different.  
That is, 256=1^2× 4^4=4^2× 2^4=16^2× 1^4

Though 4^2 and 2^4 are both equal, we are concerned only about the base
numbers in this problem. Note that permutations are not considered distinct,
for example 16^2× 1^4 and 1^4 × 16^2 are considered to be the
same.

Similarly, 10! can be written as a product of one natural number, two
squares and three cubes in two ways
(10!=42×5^2×4^2×3^3×2^3×1^3=21×5^2×2^2×4^3×3^3×1^3)
whereas 20! can be given the same representation in 41680 ways.

Let F(n) denote the number of ways in which n can be written as a product
of one natural number, two squares, three cubes and four fourth powers.

You are given that F(25!)=4933, F(100!) 
1 000 000 007=693 952 493,  
and F(1 000!)  1 000 000 007=6 364 496.

Find F(1 000 000!)  1 000 000 007.
