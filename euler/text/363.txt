A cubic Bézier curve is defined by four points: P_0, P_1, P_2, and P_3.

The curve is constructed as follows:

On the segments P_0 P_1, P_1 P_2, and P_2 P_3 the points Q_0, Q_1, and
Q_2 are drawn such that P_0 Q_0P_0 P_1 = P_1 Q_1P_1 P_2
= P_2 Q_2P_2 P_3 = t, with t in [0, 1].

On the segments Q_0 Q_1 and Q_1 Q_2 the points R_0 and R_1 are drawn
such that  
Q_0 R_0Q_0 Q_1 = Q_1 R_1Q_1 Q_2 = t for the same value
of t.

On the segment R_0 R_1 the point B is drawn such that R_0 BR_0
R_1 = t for the same value of t.

The Bézier curve defined by the points P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3 is the locus of
B as Q_0 takes all possible positions on the segment P_0 P_1.  
(Please note that for all points the value of t is the same.)

From the construction it is clear that the Bézier curve will be tangent to the
segments P_0 P_1 in P_0 and P_2 P_3 in P_3.

A cubic Bézier curve with P_0 = (1, 0), P_1 = (1, v), P_2 = (v, 1), and P_3
= (0, 1) is used to approximate a quarter circle.  
The value v  0 is chosen such that the area enclosed by the lines O P_0,
OP_3 and the curve is equal to π4 (the area of the quarter
circle).

By how many percent does the length of the curve differ from the length of the
quarter circle?  
That is, if L is the length of the curve, calculate 100 ×L -
π/2π/2  
Give your answer rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.
