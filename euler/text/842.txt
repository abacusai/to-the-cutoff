Given n equally spaced points on a circle, we define an n-star polygon as
an n-gon having those n points as vertices. Two n-star polygons
differing by a rotation/reflection are considered **different**.

For example, there are twelve 5-star polygons shown below.

For an n-star polygon S, let I(S) be the number of its self intersection
points.  
Let T(n) be the sum of I(S) over all n-star polygons S.  
For the example above T(5) = 20 because in total there are 20 self
intersection points.

Some star polygons may have intersection points made from more than two lines.
These are only counted once. For example, S, shown below is one of the sixty
6-star polygons. This one has I(S) = 4.

You are also given that T(8) = 14640.

Find âˆ‘_n = 3^60T(n). Give your answer modulo (10^9 +
7).
