For positive real numbers a,b, an a× b **torus** is a rectangle of
width a and height b, with left and right sides identified, as well as top
and bottom sides identified. In other words, when tracing a path on the
rectangle, reaching an edge results in "wrapping round" to the corresponding
point on the opposite edge.

A _tiling_ of a torus is a way to dissect it into equilateral triangles of
edge length 1. For example, the following three diagrams illustrate
respectively a 1×√(3)/2 torus with two triangles, a
√(3)× 1 torus with four triangles, and an approximately
2.8432× 2.1322 torus with fourteen triangles:

Two tilings of an a× b torus are called equivalent if it is possible to
obtain one from the other by continuously moving all triangles so that no gaps
appear and no triangles overlap at any stage during the movement. For example,
the animation below shows an equivalence between two tilings:

Let F(n) be the total number of non-equivalent tilings of all possible tori
with exactly n triangles. For example, F(6)=8, with the eight non-
equivalent tilings with six triangles listed below:

Let G(N)=∑_n=1^N F(n). You are given that G(6)=14, G(100)=8090, and
G(10^5)≡ 645124048 1 000 000 007.

Find G(10^9). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
