An equilateral triangle with integer side length n ≥ 3 is divided into
n^2 equilateral triangles with side length 1 as shown in the diagram below.  
The vertices of these triangles constitute a triangular lattice with
(n+1)(n+2)/2 lattice points.

Let H(n) be the number of all regular hexagons that can be found by
connecting 6 of these points.

For example, H(3)=1, H(6)=12 and H(20)=966.

Find ∑_n=3^12345 H(n).
