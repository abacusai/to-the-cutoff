When wrapping several cubes in paper, it is more efficient to wrap them all
together than to wrap each one individually. For example, with 10 cubes of
unit edge length, it would take 30 units of paper to wrap them in the
arrangement shown below, but 60 units to wrap them separately.

Define g(n) to be the maximum amount of paper that can be saved by wrapping
n identical 1× 1× 1 cubes in a compact arrangement, compared
with wrapping them individually. We insist that the wrapping paper is in
contact with the cubes at all points, without leaving a void.

With 10 cubes, the arrangement illustrated above is optimal, so
g(10)=60-30=30. With 18 cubes, it can be shown that the optimal arrangement
is as a 3× 3× 2, using 42 units of paper, whereas wrapping
individually would use 108 units of paper; hence g(18) = 66.

Define 
    G(N) = ∑_n=1^N g(n)
 You are given that G(18) = 530, and
G(10^6) ≡ 951640919 1 000 000 007.

Find G(10^16). Give your answer modulo 1 000 000 007.
