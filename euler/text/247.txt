Consider the region constrained by 1 ≤ x and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1/x.

Let S_1 be the largest square that can fit under the curve.  
Let S_2 be the largest square that fits in the remaining area, and so on.  
Let the index of S_n be the pair (left, below) indicating
the number of squares to the left of S_n and the number of squares below
S_n.

The diagram shows some such squares labelled by number.  
S_2 has one square to its left and none below, so the index of S_2 is
(1,0).  
It can be seen that the index of S_32 is (1,1) as is the index of
S_50.  
50 is the largest n for which the index of S_n is (1,1).

What is the largest n for which the index of S_n is (3,3)?
