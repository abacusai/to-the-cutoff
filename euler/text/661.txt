Two friends A and B are great fans of Chess. They both enjoy playing the
game, but after each game the player who lost the game would like to continue
(to get back at the other player) and the player who won would prefer to stop
(to finish on a high).

So they come up with a plan. After every game, they would toss a (biased) coin
with probability p of Heads (and hence probability 1-p of Tails). If they
get Tails, they will continue with the next game. Otherwise they end the
match. Also, after every game the players make a note of who is leading in the
match.

Let p_A denote the probability of A winning a game and p_B the
probability of B winning a game. Accordingly 1-p_A-p_B is the probability
that a game ends in a draw. Let 𝔼_A(p_A,p_B,p) denote the expected
number of times A was leading in the match.  
For example, 𝔼_A(0.25,0.25,0.5)≈ 0.585786 and
𝔼_A(0.47,0.48,0.001)≈ 377.471736, both rounded to six places
after the decimal point.

Let H(n)=∑_k=3^n 𝔼_A(1/√(k+3),1/√(k+3)+1/k^2,1/k^3)  
For example H(3) ≈ 6.8345, rounded to 4 digits after the decimal
point.

Find H(50), rounded to 4 digits after the decimal point.
