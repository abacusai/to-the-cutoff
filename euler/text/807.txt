Given a circle C and an integer n > 1, we perform the following
operations.

In step 0, we choose two uniformly random points R_0 and B_0 on C.  
In step i (1 ≤ i < n), we first choose a uniformly random point R_i
on C and connect the points R_i - 1 and R_i with a red rope; then
choose a uniformly random point B_i on C and connect the points B_i -
1 and B_i with a blue rope.  
In step n, we first connect the points R_n - 1 and R_0 with a red
rope; then connect the points B_n - 1 and B_0 with a blue rope.  
Each rope is straight between its two end points, and lies above all previous
ropes.

After step n, we get a loop of red ropes, and a loop of blue ropes.  
Sometimes the two loops can be separated, as in the left figure below;
sometimes they are "linked", hence cannot be separated, as in the middle and
right figures below.

Let P(n) be the probability that the two loops can be separated.  
For example, P(3) = 11/20 and P(5) ≈ 0.4304177690.

Find P(80), rounded to 10 digits after decimal point.
