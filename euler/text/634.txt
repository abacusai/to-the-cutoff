Define F(n) to be the number of integers x≤n that can be written in the
form x=a^2b^3, where a and b are integers not necessarily different and
both greater than 1.

For example, 32=2^2× 2^3 and 72=3^2× 2^3 are the only two
integers less than 100 that can be written in this form. Hence, F(100)=2.

Further you are given F(2× 10^4)=130 and F(3× 10^6)=2014.

Find F(9× 10^18).
