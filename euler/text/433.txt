Let E(x_0, y_0) be the number of steps it takes to determine the greatest
common divisor of x_0 and y_0 with **Euclid's algorithm**. More formally:  
x_1 = y_0, y_1 = x_0  y_0  
x_n = y_n-1, y_n = x_n-1 y_n-1  
E(x_0, y_0) is the smallest n such that y_n = 0.

We have E(1,1) = 1, E(10,6) = 3 and E(6,10) = 4.

Define S(N) as the sum of E(x,y) for 1 ≤ x,y ≤ N.  
We have S(1) = 1, S(10) = 221 and S(100) = 39826.

Find S(5· 10^6).
