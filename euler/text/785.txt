Consider the following Diophantine equation: 
    15 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 34 (xy +
    yz + zx)
 where x, y and z are positive integers.

Let S(N) be the sum of all solutions, (x,y,z), of this equation such that,
1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ N and (x, y, z) = 1.

For N = 10^2, there are three such solutions - (1, 7, 16), (8, 9, 39), (11,
21, 72). So S(10^2) = 184.

Find S(10^9).
