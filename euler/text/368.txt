The **harmonic series** 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + â‹¯ is
well known to be divergent.

If we however omit from this series every term where the denominator has a 9
in it, the series remarkably enough converges to approximately
22.9206766193.  
This modified harmonic series is called the **Kempner** series.

Let us now consider another modified harmonic series by omitting from the
harmonic series every term where the denominator has 3 or more equal
consecutive digits. One can verify that out of the first 1200 terms of the
harmonic series, only 20 terms will be omitted.  
These 20 omitted terms are:


    1/111, 1/222, 1/333, 1/444, 1/555,
    1/666, 1/777, 1/888, 1/999, 1/1000,
    1/1110,
 
    1/1111, 1/1112, 1/1113, 1/1114, 1/1115, 1/1116, 1/1117, 1/1118, 1/1119.


This series converges as well.
