Denote the average of k numbers x_1, ..., x_k by x̅ = 1/k∑_i x_i. Their variance is defined as 1/k∑_i ( x_i -
x̅) ^ 2.

Let S(n) be the sum of all quadruples of integers (a,b,c,d) satisfying 1
≤ a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ n such that their average is exactly twice
their variance.

For n=5, there are 5 such quadruples, namely: (1, 1, 1, 3), (1, 1, 3, 3),
(1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 3, 4, 4), (2, 2, 3, 5).

Hence S(5)=48. You are also given S(10^3)=37048340.

Find S(10^8). Give your answer modulo 433494437.
