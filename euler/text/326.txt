Let a_n be a sequence recursively defined by:a_1=1,  
a_n=(∑_k=1^n-1k· a_k) n.

So the first 10 elements of a_n are: 1,1,0,3,0,3,5,4,1,9.

Let f(N, M) represent the number of pairs (p, q) such that:


    #1font-family:inherit;#1 1≤ p≤ q≤ N
      and  (∑_i=p^qa_i) M=0


It can be seen that f(10,10)=4 with the pairs (3,3), (5,5), (7,9) and
(9,10).

You are also given that f(10^4,10^3)=97158.

Find f(10^12,10^6).
