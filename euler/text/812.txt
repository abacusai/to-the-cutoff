A dynamical polynomial is a **monic leading coefficient is 1** polynomial
f(x) with integer coefficients such that f(x) divides f(x^2-2).

For example, f(x) = x^2 - x - 2 is a dynamical polynomial because f(x^2-2)
= x^4-5x^2+4 = (x^2 + x -2)f(x).

Let S(n) be the number of dynamical polynomials of degree n.  
For example, S(2)=6, as there are six dynamical polynomials of degree 2:


    x^2-4x+4   ,   x^2-x-2   ,   x^2-4   ,   x^2-1
      ,   x^2+x-1   ,   x^2+2x+1


Also, S(5)=58 and S(20)=122087.

Find S(10 000). Give your answer modulo 998244353.
