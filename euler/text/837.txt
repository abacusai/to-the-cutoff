[Amidakuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amidakuji) (Japanese: 阿弥陀籤) is a
method for producing a random permutation of a set of objects.

In the beginning, a number of parallel vertical lines are drawn, one for each
object. Then a specified number of horizontal rungs are added, each lower than
any previous rungs. Each rung is drawn as a line segment spanning a randomly
select pair of adjacent vertical lines.

For example, the following diagram depicts an Amidakuji with three objects
(A, B, C) and six rungs:

The coloured lines in the diagram illustrate how to form the permutation. For
each object, starting from the top of its vertical line, trace downwards but
follow any rung encountered along the way, and record which vertical we end up
on. In this example, the resulting permutation happens to be the identity:
A↦ A, B↦ B, C↦ C.

Let a(m, n) be the number of different three-object Amidakujis that have m
rungs between A and B, and n rungs between B and C, and whose
outcome is the identity permutation. For example, a(3, 3) = 2, because the
Amidakuji shown above and its mirror image are the only ones with the required
property.

You are also given that a(123, 321) ≡ 172633303 1234567891.

Find a(123456789, 987654321). Give your answer modulo 1234567891.
