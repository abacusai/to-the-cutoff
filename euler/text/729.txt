Consider the sequence of real numbers a_n defined by the starting value
a_0 and the recurrence a_n+1=a_n-1/a_n for any n
≥ 0.

For some starting values a_0 the sequence will be periodic. For example,
a_0=√(1/2) yields the sequence: √(1/2),-√(1/2),√(1/2), …

We are interested in the range of such a periodic sequence which is the
difference between the maximum and minimum of the sequence. For example, the
range of the sequence above would be √(1/2)-(-√(1/2))=√( 2).

Let S(P) be the sum of the ranges of all such periodic sequences with a
period not exceeding P.  
For example, S(2)=2√(2)≈ 2.8284, being the sum of the ranges of
the two sequences starting with a_0=√(1/2) and a_0=-√(1/2).  
You are given S(3) ≈ 14.6461 and S(5) ≈ 124.1056.

Find S(25), rounded to 4 decimal places.
