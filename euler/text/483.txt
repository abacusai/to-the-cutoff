We define a permutation as an operation that rearranges the order of the
elements 1, 2, 3, ..., n. There are n! such permutations, one of
which leaves the elements in their initial order. For n = 3 we have 3! = 6
permutations:

  * P_1 = keep the initial order
  * P_2 = exchange the 1st and 2nd elements
  * P_3 = exchange the 1st and 3rd elements
  * P_4 = exchange the 2nd and 3rd elements
  * P_5 = rotate the elements to the right
  * P_6 = rotate the elements to the left

If we select one of these permutations, and we re-apply the _same_ permutation
repeatedly, we eventually restore the initial order.  
For a permutation P_i, let f(P_i) be the number of steps required to
restore the initial order by applying the permutation P_i repeatedly.  
For n = 3, we obtain:

  * f(P_1) = 1 : (1,2,3) → (1,2,3)
  * f(P_2) = 2 : (1,2,3) → (2,1,3) → (1,2,3)
  * f(P_3) = 2 : (1,2,3) → (3,2,1) → (1,2,3)
  * f(P_4) = 2 : (1,2,3) → (1,3,2) → (1,2,3)
  * f(P_5) = 3 : (1,2,3) → (3,1,2) → (2,3,1) → (1,2,3)
  * f(P_6) = 3 : (1,2,3) → (2,3,1) → (3,1,2) → (1,2,3)

Let g(n) be the average value of f^2(P_i) over all permutations P_i of
length n.  
g(3) = (1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2)/3! = 31/6 ≈
5.166666667e0  
g(5) = 2081/120 ≈ 1.734166667e1  
g(20) = 12422728886023769167301/2432902008176640000 ≈
5.106136147e3

Find g(350) and write the answer in scientific notation rounded to 10
significant digits, using a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent, as
in the examples above.
