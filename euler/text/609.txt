For every n ≥ 1 the **prime-counting** function π(n) is equal to the
number of primes not exceeding n.  
E.g. π(6)=3 and π(100)=25.

We say that a sequence of integers u = (u_0,⋯,u_m) is a π sequence
if

  * u_n ≥ 1 for every n 
  * u_n+1= π(u_n) 
  * u has two or more elements 

For u_0=10 there are three distinct π sequences: (10,4), (10,4,2)
and (10,4,2,1).

Let c(u) be the number of elements of u that are not prime.  
Let p(n,k) be the number of π sequences u for which u_0≤ n and
c(u)=k.  
Let P(n) be the product of all p(n,k) that are larger than 0.  
You are given: P(10)=3 × 8 × 9 × 3=648 and
P(100)=31038676032.

Find P(10^8). Give your answer modulo 1000000007.
