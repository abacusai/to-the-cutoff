Given a set, L, of unique lines, let M(L) be the number of lines in the
set and let S(L) be the sum over every line of the number of times that line
is crossed by another line in the set. For example, two sets of three lines
are shown below:

![crossed lines](resources/images/0630_threelines.png?1678992054)

In both cases M(L) is 3 and S(L) is 6: each of the three lines is
crossed by two other lines. Note that even if the lines cross at a single
point, all of the separate crossings of lines are counted.

Consider points (T_2k-1, T_2k), for integer k â‰¥ 1, generated in the
following way:

S_0 = 290797  
S_n+1 = S_n^2  50515093  
T_n = (S_n  2000) - 1000

For example, the first three points are: (527, 144), (-488, 732), (-454,
-947). Given the first n points generated in this manner, let L_n be the
set of **unique** lines that can be formed by joining each point with every
other point, the lines being extended indefinitely in both directions. We can
then define M(L_n) and S(L_n) as described above.

For example, M(L_3) = 3 and S(L_3) = 6. Also M(L_100) = 4948 and
S(L_100) = 24477690.

Find S(L_2500).
