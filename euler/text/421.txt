Numbers of the form n^15+1 are composite for every integer n  1.  
For positive integers n and m let s(n,m) be defined as the sum of the
_distinct_ prime factors of n^15+1 not exceeding m.

E.g. 2^15+1 = 3 × 3 × 11 × 331.  
So s(2,10) = 3 and s(2,1000) = 3+11+331 = 345.  
  
Also 10^15+1 = 7 × 11 × 13 × 211 × 241 × 2161
× 9091.  
So s(10,100) = 31 and s(10,1000) = 483.  

Find ∑ s(n,10^8) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^11.
