The complexity of an n× n binary matrix is the number of distinct rows
and columns.

For example, consider the 3× 3 matrices 
    𝐀 = [ 1 0 1;   0 0;   0 1 ]  𝐁 = [ 0 0 0;   0 0;   1 1 ]
 𝐀 has complexity 2 because
the set of rows and columns is 000,101. 𝐁 has complexity
3 because the set of rows and columns is 000,001,111.

For 0 ≤ k ≤ n^2, let c(n, k) be the **minimum** complexity of an
n× n binary matrix with exactly k ones.

Let 
    C(n) = ∑_k=0^n^2 c(n, k)
 For example, C(2) = c(2, 0) + c(2, 1)
+ c(2, 2) + c(2, 3) + c(2, 4) = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8.  
You are given C(5) = 64, C(10) = 274 and C(20) = 1150.

Find C(10^4).
