Let S be the set consisting of the four letters
,,,.  
For nâ‰¥ 0, let S^*(n) denote the set of words of length n consisting of
letters belonging to S.  
We designate the words , , , as _keywords_.

Let f(n) be the number of words in S^*(n) that contains all four keywords
exactly once.

This first happens for n=9, and indeed there is a unique 9 lettered word
that contain each of the keywords once:   
So, f(9)=1.

You are also given that f(15)=72863.

Find f(30).
