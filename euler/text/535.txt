Consider the infinite integer sequence S starting with:  
S = 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 8, 4, 9, 1, 10, 11, 5, …

Circle the first occurrence of each integer.  
S = circle1, 1, circle2, 1, circle3, 2,
circle4, 1, circle5, 3, circle6, 2,
circle7, circle8, 4, circle9, 1,
circle10, circle11, 5, …

The sequence is characterized by the following properties:

  * The circled numbers are consecutive integers starting with 1.
  * Immediately preceding each non-circled numbers a_i, there are exactly ⌊√(a_i)⌋ adjacent circled numbers, where ⌊ ⌋ is the floor function.
  * If we remove all circled numbers, the remaining numbers form a sequence identical to S, so S is a **fractal sequence**.

Let T(n) be the sum of the first n elements of the sequence.  
You are given T(1) = 1, T(20) = 86, T(10^3) = 364089 and T(10^9) =
498676527978348241.

Find T(10^18). Give the last 9 digits of your answer.
