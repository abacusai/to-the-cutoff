The SET® card game is played with a pack of 81 distinct cards. Each card has
four features (Shape, Color, Number, Shading). Each feature has three
different variants (e.g. Color can be red, purple, green).

A _SET_ consists of three different cards such that each feature is either the
same on each card or different on each card.

For a collection C_n of n cards, let S(C_n) denote the number of _SET_ s
in C_n. Then define F(n) = ∑_C_n S(C_n)^4 where C_n ranges
through all collections of n cards (among the 81 cards). You are given
F(3) = 1080 and F(6) = 159690960.

Find F(12).
