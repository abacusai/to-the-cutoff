The flipping game is a two player game played on an N by N square board.  
Each square contains a disk with one side white and one side black.  
The game starts with all disks showing their white side.

A turn consists of flipping all disks in a rectangle with the following
properties:

  * the upper right corner of the rectangle contains a white disk
  * the rectangle width is a perfect square (1, 4, 9, 16, ...)
  * the rectangle height is a **triangular number The triangular numbers are defined as 1/2 n(n + 1) for positive integer n.** (1, 3, 6, 10, ...)

Players alternate turns. A player wins by turning the grid all black.

Let W(N) be the number of **winning moves The first move of a strategy that
ensures a win no matter what the opponent plays.** for the first player on an
N by N board with all disks white, assuming perfect play.  
W(1) = 1, W(2) = 0, W(5) = 8 and W(10^2) = 31395.

For N=5, the first player's eight winning first moves are:
