A Slider is a chess piece that can move one square left or right.

This problem uses a cylindrical chess board where the left hand edge of the
board is connected to the right hand edge. This means that a Slider that is on
the left hand edge of the chess board can move to the right hand edge of the
same row and vice versa.

Let L(N,K) be the number of ways K non-attacking Sliders can be placed on
an N Ã— N cylindrical chess-board.

For example, L(2,2)=4 and L(6,12)=4204761.

Find L(10^9,10^15) (10^7+19)^2.
