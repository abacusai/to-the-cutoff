Consider the following binary quadratic form:


    f(x,y)=x^2+5xy+3y^2


A positive integer q has a primitive representation if there exist positive
integers x and y such that q = f(x,y) and (x,y)=1.

We are interested in primitive representations of perfect squares. For
example:  
17^2=f(1,9)  
87^2=f(13,40) = f(46,19)

Define C(N) as the total number of primitive representations of z^2 for 0
< z â‰¤ N.  
Multiple representations are counted separately, so for example z=87 is
counted twice.

You are given C(10^3)=142 and C(10^6)=142463

Find C(10^14).
