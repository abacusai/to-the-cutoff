Let p = p_1 p_2 p_3 ⋯ be an infinite sequence of random digits,
selected from 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 with equal probability.  
It can be seen that p corresponds to the real number 0.p_1 p_2 p_3 ⋯  
It can also be seen that choosing a random real number from the interval
[0,1) is equivalent to choosing an infinite sequence of random digits
selected from 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 with equal probability.

For any positive integer n with d decimal digits, let k be the smallest
index such that p_k, p_k + 1, …, p_k + d - 1 are the decimal digits
of n, in the same order.  
Also, let g(n) be the expected value of k; it can be proven that g(n) is
always finite and, interestingly, always an integer number.

For example, if n = 535, then  
for p = 31415926535897⋯, we get k = 9  
for p = 355287143650049560000490848764084685354⋯, we get k =
36  
etc and we find that g(535) = 1008.

Given that ∑_n = 2^999 g (⌊10^6/n⌋) = 27280188, find ∑_n = 2^999999 g
(⌊10^16/n⌋).

__Note__ : ⌊ x ⌋ represents the floor function.
