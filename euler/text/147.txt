There are 5 grids smaller than 3 × 2, vertical and horizontal
dimensions being important, i.e. 1 × 1, 2 × 1, 3 × 1, 1
× 2 and 2 × 2. If each of them is cross-hatched, the following
number of different rectangles could be situated within those smaller grids:

1 × 1| 1  
—|—  
2 × 1| 4  
3 × 1| 8  
1 × 2| 4  
2 × 2| 18  
  
Adding those to the 37 of the 3 × 2 grid, a total of 72 different
rectangles could be situated within 3 × 2 and smaller grids.

How many different rectangles could be situated within 47 × 43 and
smaller grids?
