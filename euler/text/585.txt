Consider the term √(x+√(y)+√(z)) that is representing a
**nested square root**. x, y and z are positive integers and y and z
are not allowed to be perfect squares, so the number below the outer square
root is irrational. Still it can be shown that for some combinations of x,
y and z the given term can be simplified into a sum and/or difference of
simple square roots of integers, actually **denesting** the square roots in
the initial expression.

Here are some examples of this denesting:  
√(3+√(2)+√(2))=√(2)+√(1)=√(2)+1  
√(8+√(15)+√(15))=√(5)+√(3)  
√(20+√(96)+√(12))=√(9)+√(6)+√(3)-√(2)=3+√(6)+√(3)-√(2)  
√(28+√(160)+√(108))=√(15)+√(6)+√(5)-√(2)

As you can see the integers used in the denested expression may also be
perfect squares resulting in further simplification.

Let F(n) be the number of different terms √(x+√(y)+√(z)), that can be denested into the sum and/or
difference of a finite number of square roots, given the additional condition
that 0<x ≤ n. That is,  
√(x+√(y)+√(z))=∑_i=1^k s_i√(a_i)  
with k, x, y, z and all a_i being positive integers, all s_i =±
1 and x≤ n.  
Furthermore y and z are not allowed to be perfect squares.

Nested roots with the same value are not considered different, for example
√(7+√(3)+√(27)), √(7+√(12)+√(12))
and √(7+√(27)+√(3)), that can all three be denested into
2+√(3), would only be counted once.

You are given that F(10)=17, F(15)=46, F(20)=86, F(30)=213 and
F(100)=2918 and F(5000)=11134074.  
Find F(5000000).
