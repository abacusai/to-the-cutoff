A list of size n is a sequence of n natural numbers.  
Examples are (2,4,6), (2,6,4), (10,6,15,6), and (11).

The **greatest common divisor** , or , of a list is the largest natural
number that divides all entries of the list.  
Examples: (2,6,4) = 2, (10,6,15,6) = 1 and (11) = 11.

The **least common multiple** , or lcm, of a list is the
smallest natural number divisible by each entry of the list.  
Examples: lcm(2,6,4) = 12, lcm(10,6,15,6) =
30 and lcm(11) = 11.

Let f(G, L, N) be the number of lists of size N with ≥ G and
lcm≤ L. For example:

f(10, 100, 1) = 91.  
f(10, 100, 2) = 327.  
f(10, 100, 3) = 1135.  
f(10, 100, 1000)  101^4 = 3286053.

Find f(10^6, 10^12, 10^18)  101^4.
