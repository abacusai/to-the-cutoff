For an odd prime p, define f(p) =
⌊2^(2^p)/p⌋2^p  
For example, when p=3, ⌊ 2^8/3⌋ = 85 ≡ 5  8 and so
f(3) = 5.

Further define g(p) = f(p) p. You are given g(31) = 17.

Now define G(N) to be the summation of g(p) for all odd primes less than
N.  
You are given G(100) = 474 and G(10^4) = 2819236.

Find G(10^7).
