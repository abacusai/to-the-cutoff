        "description": "Given an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n elements, find the maximum\npossible sum the array can have after performing the following operation any\nnumber of times: Choose \n    2\n adjacent elements and flip both of their\nsigns. In other words choose an index \n    i\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n    - 1\n and assign \n    a_i = -a_i\n and \n    a_i+1 = -a_i+1\n. Input The\ninput consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case\ncontains an integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b710^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of the array. The following line contains \n    n\n space-separated\nintegers \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For each test case, output the maximum possible sum\nthe array can have after performing the described operation any number of\ntimes. Example Input 5 3 -1 -1 -1 5 1 5 -5 0 2 3 1 2 3 6 -1 10 9 8 7 6 2 -1 -1\nOutput 1 13 6 39 2 Note For the first test case, by performing the operation\non the first two elements, we can change the array from \n    [-1, -1, -1]\n to\n\n    [1, 1, -1]\n, and it can be proven this array obtains the maximum possible\nsum which is \n    1 + 1 + (-1) = 1\n. For the second test case, by performing\nthe operation on \n    -5\n and \n    0\n, we change the array from \n    [1, 5, -5,\n    0, 2]\n to \n    [1, 5, -(-5), -0, 2] = [1, 5, 5, 0, 2]\n, which has the\nmaximum sum since all elements are non-negative. So, the answer is \n    1 + 5 +\n    5 + 0 + 2 = 13\n. For the third test case, the array already contains only\npositive numbers, so performing operations is unnecessary. The answer is just\nthe sum of the whole array, which is \n    1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n.\n\n",
