        "description": "Vasya has a sequence of cubes and exactly one integer is written on each cube.\nVasya exhibited all his cubes in a row. So the sequence of numbers written on\nthe cubes in the order from the left to the right equals to a1, a2, ..., an.\nWhile Vasya was walking, his little brother Stepan played with Vasya's cubes\nand changed their order, so now the sequence of numbers written on the cubes\nbecame equal to b1, b2, ..., bn. Stepan said that he swapped only cubes which\nwhere on the positions between l and r, inclusive, and did not remove or add\nany other cubes (i. e. he said that he reordered cubes between positions l and\nr, inclusive, in some way). Your task is to determine if it is possible that\nStepan said the truth, or it is guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother.\nInput The first line contains three integers n, l, r (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r\n\u2264 n) \u2014 the number of Vasya's cubes and the positions told by Stepan. The\nsecond line contains the sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 n) \u2014 the sequence\nof integers written on cubes in the Vasya's order. The third line contains the\nsequence b1, b2, ..., bn (1 \u2264 bi \u2264 n) \u2014 the sequence of integers written on\ncubes after Stepan rearranged their order. It is guaranteed that Stepan did\nnot remove or add other cubes, he only rearranged Vasya's cubes. Output Print\n\"LIE\" (without quotes) if it is guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother.\nIn the other case, print \"TRUTH\" (without quotes). Examples Input 5 2 4 3 4 2\n3 1 3 2 3 4 1 Output TRUTH Input 3 1 2 1 2 3 3 1 2 Output LIE Input 4 2 4 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 Output TRUTH Note In the first example there is a situation when\nStepan said the truth. Initially the sequence of integers on the cubes was\nequal to [3, 4, 2, 3, 1]. Stepan could at first swap cubes on positions 2 and\n3 (after that the sequence of integers on cubes became equal to [3, 2, 4, 3,\n1]), and then swap cubes in positions 3 and 4 (after that the sequence of\nintegers on cubes became equal to [3, 2, 3, 4, 1]). In the second example it\nis not possible that Stepan said truth because he said that he swapped cubes\nonly between positions 1 and 2, but we can see that it is guaranteed that he\nchanged the position of the cube which was on the position 3 at first. So it\nis guaranteed that Stepan deceived his brother. In the third example for any\nvalues l and r there is a situation when Stepan said the truth.\n\n",
