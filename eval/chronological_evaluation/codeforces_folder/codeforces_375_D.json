        "description": "You have a rooted tree consisting of n vertices. Each vertex of the tree has\nsome color. We will assume that the tree vertices are numbered by integers\nfrom 1 to n. Then we represent the color of vertex v as cv. The tree root is a\nvertex with number 1. In this problem you need to answer to m queries. Each\nquery is described by two integers vj, kj. The answer to query vj, kj is the\nnumber of such colors of vertices x, that the subtree of vertex vj contains at\nleast kj vertices of color x. You can find the definition of a rooted tree by\nthe following link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory). Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5). The\nnext line contains a sequence of integers c1, c2, ..., cn (1 \u2264 ci \u2264 10^5). The\nnext n - 1 lines contain the edges of the tree. The i-th line contains the\nnumbers ai, bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 n; ai \u2260 bi) \u2014 the vertices connected by an edge\nof the tree. Next m lines contain the queries. The j-th line contains two\nintegers vj, kj (1 \u2264 vj \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 kj \u2264 10^5). Output Print m integers \u2014 the\nanswers to the queries in the order the queries appear in the input. Examples\nInput 8 5 1 2 2 3 3 2 3 3 1 2 1 5 2 3 2 4 5 6 5 7 5 8 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 3 5 3\nOutput 2 2 1 0 1 Input 4 1 1 2 3 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 1 1 Output 4 Note A subtree of\nvertex v in a rooted tree with root r is a set of vertices u : dist(r, v) +\ndist(v, u) = dist(r, u). Where dist(x, y) is the length (in edges) of the\nshortest path between vertices x and y.\n\n",
