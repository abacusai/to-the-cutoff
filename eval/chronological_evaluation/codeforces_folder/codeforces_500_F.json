        "description": "Dohyun is running a grocery store. He sells n items numbered by integers from\n1 to n. The i-th (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) of them costs ci dollars, and if I buy it, my\nhappiness increases by hi. Each item can be displayed only for p units of time\nbecause of freshness. As Dohyun displays the i-th item at time ti, the\ncustomers can buy the i-th item only from time ti to time ti + (p - 1)\ninclusively. Also, each customer cannot buy the same item more than once. I'd\nlike to visit Dohyun's grocery store and buy some items for the New Year\nParty, and maximize my happiness. Because I am a really busy person, I can\nvisit the store only once, and for very short period of time. In other words,\nif I visit the store at time t, I can only buy the items available at time t.\nBut I can buy as many items as possible, if the budget holds. I can't buy same\nitem several times due to store rules. It is not necessary to use the whole\nbudget. I made a list of q pairs of integers (aj, bj), which means I may visit\nthe store at time aj, and spend at most bj dollars at the store. For each\npair, I'd like to know the maximum happiness I can obtain. But there are so\nmany pairs that I can't handle them. Can you help me? Input The first line\ncontains two space-separated integers n and p (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4000, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 10 000) \u2014\nthe number of items, and the display time of each item. Next n lines describe\nthe items. The i-th (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) of them contains three space-separated\nintegers ci, hi, ti (1 \u2264 ci, hi \u2264 4000, 1 \u2264 ti \u2264 10 000) \u2014 the cost of the\ni-th item, the happiness of the i-th item, and the time when the i-th item\nstarts to be displayed. The next line contains an integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 20 000)\u2014\nthe number of candidates. Next q lines describe the candidates. The j-th (1 \u2264\nj \u2264 q) of them contains two space-separated integers aj, bj (1 \u2264 aj \u2264 20 000,\n1 \u2264 bj \u2264 4000) \u2014 the visit time and the budget for j-th visit of store. Output\nFor each candidate, print a single line containing the maximum happiness that\nI can obtain by buying some items. Examples Input 4 4 2 3 2 3 5 1 4 7 2 11 15\n5 4 1 3 2 5 2 6 5 14 Output 5 8 10 18 Input 5 4 3 2 1 7 4 4 2 1 2 6 3 5 3 2 2\n10 1 5 2 5 4 8 4 9 4 10 5 8 5 9 5 10 8 4 7 9 Output 2 3 5 5 6 4 5 6 0 4 Note\nConsider the first sample. At time 1, only the 2nd item is available. I can\nbuy the 2nd item using 3 dollars and my happiness will increase by 5. At time\n2, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd item is available. I can buy the 1st item using 2\ndollars, and the 2nd item using 3 dollars. My happiness will increase by 3 + 5\n= 8. At time 2, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd item is available. I can buy the 1st\nitem using 2 dollars, and the 3nd item using 4 dollars. My happiness will\nincrease by 3 + 7 = 10. At time 5, the 1st, 3rd, and 4th item is available. I\ncan buy the 1st item using 2 dollars, and the 4th item using 11 dollars. My\nhappiness will increase by 3 + 15 = 18. Note that I don't need to use the\nwhole budget in this case.\n\n",
