        "description": "Little09 and his friends are playing a game. There are \n    n\n players, and\nthe temperature value of the player \n    i\n is \n    i\n. The types of\nenvironment are expressed as \n    0\n or \n    1\n. When two players fight in a\nspecific environment, if its type is \n    0\n, the player with a lower\ntemperature value in this environment always wins; if it is \n    1\n, the\nplayer with a higher temperature value in this environment always wins. The\ntypes of the \n    n-1\n environments form a binary string \n    s\n with a length\nof \n    n-1\n. If there are \n    x\n players participating in the game, there\nwill be a total of \n    x-1\n battles, and the types of the \n    x-1\n\nenvironments will be the first \n    x-1\n characters of \n    s\n. While there is\nmore than one player left in the tournament, choose any two remaining players\nto fight. The player who loses will be eliminated from the tournament. The\ntype of the environment of battle \n    i\n is \n    s_i\n. For each \n    x\n from\n\n    2\n to \n    n\n, answer the following question: if all players whose\ntemperature value does not exceed \n    x\n participate in the game, how many\nplayers have a chance to win? Input Each test contains multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first\nline of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264\n    2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of players. The second line of each test case\ncontains a binary string \n    s\n with a length \n    n-1\n. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    3\n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case output \n    n-1\n integers \u2014 for each\n\n    x\n from \n    2\n to \n    n\n, output the number of players that have a\nchance to win. Example Input 2 4 001 4 101 Output 1 1 3 1 2 3 Note In the\nfirst test case, for \n    x=2\n and \n    x=3\n, only the player whose\ntemperature value is \n    1\n can be the winner. For \n    x=4\n, the player\nwhose temperature value is \n    2,3,4\n can be the winner.\n\n",
