        "description": "You, the mighty Blackout, are standing in the upper-left \n    (0,0)\n corner of\n\n    N\nx\n    M\n matrix. You must move either right or down each second. There\nare \n    K\n transformers jumping around the matrix in the following way. Each\ntransformer starts jumping from position \n    (x,y)\n, at time \n    t\n, and\njumps to the next position each second. The \n    x\n-axes grows downwards, and\n\n    y\n-axes grows to the right. The order of jumping positions is defined as\n\n    (x,y),(x+d,y-d),(x+d,y),(x,y+d)\n, and is periodic. Before time \n    t\n\ntransformer is not in the matrix. You want to arrive to the bottom-right\ncorner \n    (N-1,M-1)\n, while slaying transformers and losing the least\npossible amount of energy. When you meet the transformer (or more of them) in\nthe matrix field, you must kill them all, and you lose the sum of the energy\namounts required to kill each transformer. After the transformer is killed, he\nof course stops jumping, falls into the abyss and leaves the matrix world.\nOutput minimum possible amount of energy wasted. Input In the first line,\nintegers \n    N\n,\n    M\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 N, M \n    \u2264 500\n), representing size\nof the matrix, and \n    K\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 K \n    \u2264 5*10^5\n) , the number of\njumping transformers. In next \n    K\n lines, for each transformer, numbers\n\n    x\n, \n    y\n, \n    d\n (\n    d \n    \u2265 1\n), \n    t\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    N+M-2\n), and \n    e\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 e \n    \u2264 10^9\n), representing starting\ncoordinates of transformer, jumping positions distance in pattern described\nabove, time when transformer starts jumping, and energy required to kill it.\nIt is guaranteed that all 4 of jumping points of the transformers are within\nmatrix coordinates Output Print single integer, the minimum possible amount of\nenergy wasted, for Blackout to arrive at bottom-right corner. Example Input 3\n3 5 0 1 1 0 7 1 1 1 0 10 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 0 1 1 2 3 Output 9 Note If\nBlackout takes the path from (0, 0) to (2, 0), and then from (2, 0) to (2, 2)\nhe will need to kill the first and third transformer for a total energy cost\nof 9. There exists no path with less energy value.\n\n",
