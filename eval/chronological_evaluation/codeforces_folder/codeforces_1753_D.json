        "description": "Andrew loves the sea. That's why, at the height of the summer season, he\ndecided to go to the beach, taking a sunbed with him to sunbathe. The beach is\na rectangular field with \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n columns. Some cells of the\nbeach are free, some have roads, stones, shops and other non-movable objects.\nSome of two adjacent along the side cells can have sunbeds located either\nhorizontally or vertically. Andrew hopes to put his sunbed somewhere, but\nthat's a bad luck, there may no longer be free places for him! That's why\nAndrew asked you to help him to find a free place for his sunbed. Andrew's\nsunbed also should be places on two adjacent cells. If there are no two\nadjacent free cells, then in order to free some place for a sunbed, you will\nhave to disturb other tourists. You can do the following actions: Come to some\nsunbed and, after causing \n    p\n units of discomfort to its owner, lift the\nsunbed by one of its sides and rotate it by \n    90\n degrees. One half of the\nsunbed must remain in the same cell and another half of the sunbed must move\nto the free cell. At the same time, anything could be on the way of a sunbed\nduring the rotation . Rotation of the sunbed by \n    90\n degrees around cell\n\n    (1, 2)\n. Come to some sunbed and, after causing \n    q\n units of\ndiscomfort to its owner, shift the sunbed along its long side by one cell. One\nhalf of the sunbed must move to the place of another, and another \u2014 to the\nfree cell. Shift of the sunbed by one cell to the right. In any moment each\nsunbed occupies two adjacent free cells. You cannot move more than one sunbed\nat a time. Help Andrew to free a space for his sunbed, causing the minimum\npossible number of units of discomfort to other tourists, or detect that it is\nimpossible. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 300\n     000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u00b7 m \n    \u2264\n    300\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of rows and columns in rectangle. The second line\ncontains two integers \n    p\n and \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p, q \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014\nthe number of units of discomfort caused by rotation and shift of a sunbed,\nrespectively. Each of the following \n    n\n lines contains \n    m\n characters,\ndescribing cells of the rectangle. Each lines consists of characters \"L\", \"R\",\n\"D\", \"U\", \".\" and \"#\", denoting the type of the cell. Characters \"L\", \"R\", \"D\"\nand \"U\" denote a half of a sunbed placed in the cell \u2014 left, right, bottom and\ntop half, respectively. Character \".\" denotes a free cell and character \"#\" \u2014\na cell, occupied by some non-movable object. Output Print one integer \u2014 the\nminimum possible number of units of discomfort, caused to other tourists, to\nfree a space for a sunbed. If it is impossible to free a space for a sunbed,\nprint \n    -1\n. Examples Input 2 5 5 2 .LR## ##LR. Output 4 Input 2 3 4 5 LR.\n#.# Output -1 Input 4 3 10 10 .LR ### UU# DD. Output -1 Input 3 6 10 7 .U##.#\n#DLR## .##LR. Output 24 Note In the first example we can shift upper sunbed to\nthe left and lower sunbed \u2014 to the right. Andrew will be able to put his\nsunbed vertically in the middle of the beach. We well cause \n    2 + 2 = 4\n\nunits of discomfort. It is easy to prove that it is an optimal answer. Optimal\nstrategy in the first example (Andrew's sunbed is colored white). In the\nsecond example it is impossible to free a space for Andrew's sunbed. All\npossible states of the beach after any rotates and shifts are illustrated in\nthe problem statement.\n\n",
