        "name": "Thwarting Demonstrations",
        "description": "It is dark times in Berland. Berlyand opposition, funded from a neighboring\nstate, has organized a demonstration in Berland capital Bertown. Through the\nwork of intelligence we know that the demonstrations are planned to last for k\ndays. Fortunately, Berland has a special police unit, which can save the\ncountry. It has exactly n soldiers numbered from 1 to n. Berland general, the\ncommander of the detachment, must schedule the detachment's work in these\ndifficult k days. In each of these days, the general must send a certain\nnumber of police officers to disperse riots. Since the detachment is large and\nthe general is not very smart, he can only select a set of all soldiers\nnumbered from l to r, inclusive, where l and r are selected arbitrarily. Now\nthe general has exactly two problems. First, he cannot send the same group\ntwice \u2014 then soldiers get bored and they rebel. Second, not all soldiers are\nequally reliable. Every soldier has a reliability of ai. The reliability of\nthe detachment is counted as the sum of reliabilities of soldiers in it. The\nreliability of a single soldier can be negative, then when you include him in\nthe detachment, he will only spoil things. The general is distinguished by his\ngreat greed and shortsightedness, so each day he sends to the dissolution the\nmost reliable group of soldiers possible (that is, of all the groups that have\nnot been sent yet). The Berland Government has decided to know what would be\nthe minimum reliability of the detachment, sent to disperse the demonstrations\nduring these k days. The general himself can not cope with such a difficult\ntask. Help him to not embarrass himself in front of his superiors! Input The\nfirst line contains two integers n and k \u2014 the number of soldiers in the\ndetachment and the number of times somebody goes on duty. The second line\ncontains n space-separated integers ai, their absolute value doesn't exceed\n10^9 \u2014 the soldiers' reliabilities. Please do not use the \nread or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++, it is preferred to use cin, cout streams\nof the \nreliability of the groups that go on duty during these k days. Examples Input\n3 4 1 4 2 Output 4 Input 4 6 2 -1 2 -1 Output 1 Input 8 10 1 -2 3 -4 5 -6 7 -8\nOutput 2\n\n",
