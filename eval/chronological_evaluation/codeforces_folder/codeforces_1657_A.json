        "description": "There's a chip in the point \n    (0, 0)\n of the coordinate plane. In one\noperation, you can move the chip from some point \n    (x_1, y_1)\n to some\npoint \n    (x_2, y_2)\n if the Euclidean distance between these two points is\nan integer (i.e. \n    \u221a((x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2)\n is integer). Your task\nis to determine the minimum number of operations required to move the chip\nfrom the point \n    (0, 0)\n to the point \n    (x, y)\n. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 3000\n) \u2014 number of\ntest cases. The single line of each test case contains two integers \n    x\n\nand \n    y\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the coordinates of the destination\npoint. Output For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of\noperations required to move the chip from the point \n    (0, 0)\n to the point\n\n    (x, y)\n. Example Input 3 8 6 0 0 9 15 Output 1 0 2 Note In the first\nexample, one operation \n    (0, 0) \n    \u2192 (8, 6)\n is enough.\n\n    \u221a((0-8)^2+(0-6)^2)=\n    \u221a(64+36)=\n    \u221a(100)=10\n is an integer.\nIn the second example, the chip is already at the destination point. In the\nthird example, the chip can be moved as follows: \n    (0, 0) \n    \u2192 (5,\n    12) \n    \u2192 (9, 15)\n.\n\n    \u221a((0-5)^2+(0-12)^2)=\n    \u221a(25+144)=\n    \u221a(169)=13\n and\n\n    \u221a((5-9)^2+(12-15)^2)=\n    \u221a(16+9)=\n    \u221a(25)=5\n are integers.\n\n",
