        "description": "One evening Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy have come up with a game. Since the\nponies are friends, they have decided not to compete in the game but to pursue\na common goal. The game starts on a square flat grid, which initially has the\noutline borders built up. Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy have flat square blocks\nwith size \n    1\n    \u00d71\n, Rainbow Dash has an infinite amount of light blue\nblocks, Fluttershy has an infinite amount of yellow blocks. The blocks are\nplaced according to the following rule: each newly placed block must touch the\nbuilt on the previous turns figure by a side (note that the outline borders of\nthe grid are built initially). At each turn, one pony can place any number of\nblocks of her color according to the game rules. Rainbow and Fluttershy have\nfound out that they can build patterns on the grid of the game that way. They\nhave decided to start with something simple, so they made up their mind to\nplace the blocks to form a chess coloring. Rainbow Dash is well-known for her\nspeed, so she is interested in the minimum number of turns she and Fluttershy\nneed to do to get a chess coloring, covering the whole grid with blocks.\nPlease help her find that number! Since the ponies can play many times on\ndifferent boards, Rainbow Dash asks you to find the minimum numbers of turns\nfor several grids of the games. The chess coloring in two colors is the one in\nwhich each square is neighbor by side only with squares of different colors.\nInput The first line contains a single integer \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264\n    100\n): the number of grids of the games. Each of the next \n    T\n lines\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n): the size of\nthe side of the grid of the game. Output For each grid of the game print the\nminimum number of turns required to build a chess coloring pattern out of\nblocks on it. Example Input 2 3 4 Output 2 3 Note For \n    3\n    \u00d73\n grid\nponies can make two following moves:\n\n",
