        "description": "One day, Ahmed_Hossam went to Hemose and said \"Let's solve a gym contest!\".\nHemose didn't want to do that, as he was playing Valorant, so he came up with\na problem and told it to Ahmed to distract him. Sadly, Ahmed can't solve it...\nCould you help him? There is an Agent in Valorant, and he has \n    n\n weapons.\nThe \n    i\n-th weapon has a damage value \n    a_i\n, and the Agent will face an\nenemy whose health value is \n    H\n. The Agent will perform one or more moves\nuntil the enemy dies. In one move, he will choose a weapon and decrease the\nenemy's health by its damage value. The enemy will die when his health will\nbecome less than or equal to \n    0\n. However, not everything is so easy: the\nAgent can't choose the same weapon for \n    2\n times in a row. What is the\nminimum number of times that the Agent will need to use the weapons to kill\nthe enemy? Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains the number of test cases \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5)\n.\nDescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    H\n \n    (2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^3, 1 \n    \u2264\n    H \n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 the number of available weapons and the initial health\nvalue of the enemy. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 the\ndamage values of the weapons. It's guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case,\nprint a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of times that the Agent will have\nto use the weapons to kill the enemy. Example Input 3 2 4 3 7 2 6 4 2 3 11 2 1\n7 Output 1 2 3 Note In the first test case, the Agent can use the second\nweapon, making health value of the enemy equal to \n    4-7=-3\n. \n    -3 \n    \u2264\n    0\n, so the enemy is dead, and using weapon \n    1\n time was enough. In the\nsecond test case, the Agent can use the first weapon first, and then the\nsecond one. After this, the health of enemy will drop to \n    6-4-2 = 0\n,\nmeaning he would be killed after using weapons \n    2\n times. In the third\ntest case, the Agent can use the weapons in order (third, first, third),\ndecreasing the health value of enemy to \n    11 - 7 - 2 - 7 = -5\n after using\nthe weapons \n    3\n times. Note that we can't kill the enemy by using the\nthird weapon twice, as even though \n    11-7-7<0\n, it's not allowed to use the\nsame weapon twice in a row.\n\n",
