        "description": "You are given a string \n    s\n with length \n    n-1\n whose characters are\neither \n    \n or \n    \n. Count the permutations\n\n    p_1, \n      p_2, \n     \n    \u2026, \n      p_n\n of \n    1, \n      2, \n     \n    \u2026,\n    \n      n\n such that, for all \n    i = 1, \n      2, \n     \n    \u2026, \n      n - 1\n, if\n\n    s_i\n is \n    \n then \n    p_i < p_i+1\n and if \n    s_i\n is\n\n    \n then \n    p_i > p_i+1\n. Since this number can be very\nlarge, compute its logarithm in base \n    2\n. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n). The second line\ncontains a string \n    s\n of length \n    n-1\n; each character of \n    s\n is\neither \n    \n or \n    \n. Output Print the logarithm in\nbase \n    2\n of the number of permutations satisfying the constraints\ndescribed in the statement. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute\nor relative error does not exceed \n    10^-6\n. Formally, let your answer be\n\n    x\n and let the correct answer be \n    y\n. Your answer is accepted if and\nonly if \n    |x - y|/\n    max(1, |y|)\n    \u2264 10^-6\n. Examples Input\n2 < Output 0.0000000000 Input 3 <> Output 1.0000000000 Input 5 ><<< Output\n2.0000000000 Input 10 <><<<<<>> Output 9.8281364842 Note In the first sample,\nthere is only one valid permutation, that is \n    [2, 1]\n. Since\n\n    log_2(1)=0\n, the correct output is \n    0\n. In the second sample,\nthere are \n    2\n valid permutations, that are \n    [3, 1, 2]\n and \n    [2, 1,\n    3]\n. Since \n    log_2(2)=1\n, the correct output is \n    1\n. In the third\nsample, there are \n    4\n valid permutations, that are \n    [1, 5, 4, 3, 2]\n,\n\n    [2, 5, 4, 3, 1]\n, \n    [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]\n, \n    [4, 5, 3, 2, 1]\n. Since\n\n    log_2(4)=2\n, the correct output is \n    2\n. In the fourth sample,\nthere are \n    909\n valid permutations. Notice that\n\n    log_2(909)=9.828136484194\n    \u2026\n\n\n",
