        "description": "You wanted to write a text \n    t\n consisting of \n    m\n lowercase Latin\nletters. But instead, you have written a text \n    s\n consisting of \n    n\n\nlowercase Latin letters, and now you want to fix it by obtaining the text\n\n    t\n from the text \n    s\n. Initially, the cursor of your text editor is at\nthe end of the text \n    s\n (after its last character). In one move, you can\ndo one of the following actions: press the \"left\" button, so the cursor is\nmoved to the left by one position (or does nothing if it is pointing at the\nbeginning of the text, i. e. before its first character); press the \"right\"\nbutton, so the cursor is moved to the right by one position (or does nothing\nif it is pointing at the end of the text, i. e. after its last character);\npress the \"home\" button, so the cursor is moved to the beginning of the text\n(before the first character of the text); press the \"end\" button, so the\ncursor is moved to the end of the text (after the last character of the text);\npress the \"backspace\" button, so the character before the cursor is removed\nfrom the text (if there is no such character, nothing happens). Your task is\nto calculate the minimum number of moves required to obtain the text \n    t\n\nfrom the text \n    s\n using the given set of actions, or determine it is\nimpossible to obtain the text \n    t\n from the text \n    s\n. You have to\nanswer \n    T\n independent test cases. Input The first line of the input\ncontains one integer \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Then \n    T\n test cases follow. The first line of the test case\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5000\n)\n\u2014 the length of \n    s\n and the length of \n    t\n, respectively. The second\nline of the test case contains the string \n    s\n consisting of \n    n\n\nlowercase Latin letters. The third line of the test case contains the string\n\n    t\n consisting of \n    m\n lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that\nthe sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    5000\n (\n    \u2211 n\n    \n    \u2264 5000\n). Output For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the minimum\nnumber of moves required to obtain the text \n    t\n from the text \n    s\n\nusing the given set of actions, or -1 if it is impossible to obtain the text\n\n    t\n from the text \n    s\n in the given test case.
