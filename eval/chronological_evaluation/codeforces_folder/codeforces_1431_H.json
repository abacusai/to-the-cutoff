        "description": "Marina plays a new rogue-like game. In this game, there are \n    n\n different\ncharacter species and \n    m\n different classes. The game is played in runs;\nfor each run, Marina has to select a species and a class for her character. If\nshe selects the \n    i\n-th species and the \n    j\n-th class, she will get\n\n    c_i, j\n points for this run. Initially, some species and classes are\nunlocked, all others are locked. To unlock the \n    i\n-th species, Marina has\nto get at least \n    a_i\n points in total for previous runs \u2014 that is, as soon\nas her total score for played runs is at least \n    a_i\n, this species is\nunlocked. Similarly, to unlock the \n    j\n-th class, she has to get at least\n\n    b_j\n points in total for previous runs. If \n    a_i = 0\n for some\n\n    i\n, then this species is unlocked initially (the same applies to classes\nwith \n    b_j = 0\n). Marina wants to unlock all species and classes in the\nminimum number of runs. Before playing the game, she can read exactly one\nguide on some combination of species and class, and reading a guide will\nincrease the score she gets for all runs with that combination by \n    k\n\n(formally, before playing the game, she can increase exactly one value of\n\n    c_i, j\n by \n    k\n). What is the minimum number of runs she has to play\nto unlock all species and classes if she chooses the combination to read a\nguide on optimally? Input The first line contains three integers \n    n\n,\n\n    m\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 1500\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n). The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n, ...,\n\n    a_n\n (\n    0 = a_1 \n    \u2264 a_2 \n    \u2264\n    \u2026\n    \u2264 a_n \n    \u2264 10^12\n),\nwhere \n    a_i\n is the number of points required to unlock the \n    i\n-th\nspecies (or \n    0\n, if it is unlocked initially). Note that \n    a_1 = 0\n,\nand these values are non-descending. The third line contains \n    m\n integers\n\n    b_1\n, \n    b_2\n, ..., \n    b_m\n (\n    0 = b_1 \n    \u2264 b_2 \n    \u2264\n    \u2026\n    \u2264\n    b_m \n    \u2264 10^12\n), where \n    b_i\n is the number of points required to\nunlock the \n    i\n-th class (or \n    0\n, if it is unlocked initially). Note\nthat \n    b_1 = 0\n, and these values are non-descending. Then \n    n\n lines\nfollow, each of them contains \n    m\n integers. The \n    j\n-th integer in the\n\n    i\n-th line is \n    c_i, j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i, j\n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the\nscore Marina gets for a run with the \n    i\n-th species and the \n    j\n-th\nclass. Output Print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of runs Marina has to\nplay to unlock all species and all classes if she can read exactly one guide\nbefore playing the game. Examples Input 3 4 2 0 5 7 0 2 6 10 2 5 5 2 5 3 4 4 3\n4 2 4 Output 3 Input 4 2 1 0 3 9 9 0 2 3 3 5 1 1 3 2 3 Output 2 Input 3 3 5 0\n8 11 0 0 3 3 1 3 1 2 1 1 1 3 Output 2 Note The explanation for the first test:\nMarina reads a guide on the combination of the \n    1\n-st species and the\n\n    2\n-nd class. Thus, \n    c_1, 2\n becomes \n    7\n. Initially, only the\n\n    1\n-st species and the \n    1\n-st class are unlocked. Marina plays a run\nwith the \n    1\n-st species and the \n    1\n-st class. Her score becomes\n\n    2\n, and she unlocks the \n    2\n-nd class. Marina plays a run with the\n\n    1\n-st species and the \n    2\n-nd class. Her score becomes \n    9\n, and\nshe unlocks everything except the \n    4\n-th class. Marina plays a run with\nthe \n    3\n-rd species and the \n    3\n-rd class. Her score becomes \n    11\n,\nand she unlocks the \n    4\n-th class. She has unlocked everything in \n    3\n\nruns. Note that this way to unlock everything is not the only one. The\nexplanation for the second test: Marina reads a guide on the combination of\nthe \n    2\n-nd species and the \n    1\n-st class. Thus, \n    c_2, 1\n becomes\n\n    6\n. Initially, only the \n    1\n-st species and the \n    1\n-st class are\nunlocked. Marina plays a run with the \n    1\n-st species and the \n    1\n-st\nclass. Her score becomes \n    3\n, and she unlocks the \n    2\n-nd species and\nthe \n    2\n-nd class. Marina plays a run with the \n    2\n-nd species and the\n\n    1\n-st class. Her score becomes \n    9\n, and she unlocks the \n    3\n-rd\nspecies and the \n    4\n-th species. She has unlocked everything in \n    2\n\nruns. As in the \n    1\n-st example, this is not the only way to unlock\neverything in \n    2\n runs.\n\n",
