        "description": "You are given an integer \n    n\n. You can perform any of the following\noperations with this number an arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times:\nReplace \n    n\n with \n    n/2\n if \n    n\n is divisible by \n    2\n;\nReplace \n    n\n with \n    2n/3\n if \n    n\n is divisible by \n    3\n;\nReplace \n    n\n with \n    4n/5\n if \n    n\n is divisible by \n    5\n.\nFor example, you can replace \n    30\n with \n    15\n using the first operation,\nwith \n    20\n using the second operation or with \n    24\n using the third\noperation. Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain\n\n    1\n from \n    n\n or say that it is impossible to do it. You have to answer\n\n    q\n independent queries. Input The first line of the input contains one\ninteger \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of queries. The next\n\n    q\n lines contain the queries. For each query you are given the integer\nnumber \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^18\n). Output Print the answer for\neach query on a new line. If it is impossible to obtain \n    1\n from \n    n\n,\nprint -1. Otherwise, print the minimum number of moves required to do it.\nExample Input 7 1 10 25 30 14 27 1000000000000000000 Output 0 4 6 6 -1 6 72\n\n",
