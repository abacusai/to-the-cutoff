        "description": "Let's call an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n positive (greater than\n\n    0\n) integers beautiful if the following condition is held for every\n\n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n: either \n    a_i = 1\n, or at least one of the\nnumbers \n    a_i - 1\n and \n    a_i - 2\n exists in the array as well. For\nexample: the array \n    [5, 3, 1]\n is beautiful: for \n    a_1\n, the number\n\n    a_1 - 2 = 3\n exists in the array; for \n    a_2\n, the number \n    a_2 - 2 =\n    1\n exists in the array; for \n    a_3\n, the condition \n    a_3 = 1\n holds;\nthe array \n    [1, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n is beautiful: for \n    a_1\n, the condition\n\n    a_1 = 1\n holds; for every other number \n    a_i\n, the number \n    a_i - 1 =\n    1\n exists in the array; the array \n    [1, 4]\n is not beautiful: for\n\n    a_2\n, neither \n    a_2 - 2 = 2\n nor \n    a_2 - 1 = 3\n exists in the\narray, and \n    a_2 \n     1\n; the array \n    [2]\n is not beautiful: for\n\n    a_1\n, neither \n    a_1 - 1 = 1\n nor \n    a_1 - 2 = 0\n exists in the\narray, and \n    a_1 \n     1\n; the array \n    [2, 1, 3]\n is beautiful: for\n\n    a_1\n, the number \n    a_1 - 1 = 1\n exists in the array; for \n    a_2\n,\nthe condition \n    a_2 = 1\n holds; for \n    a_3\n, the number \n    a_3 - 2 = 1\n\nexists in the array. You are given a positive integer \n    s\n. Find the\nminimum possible size of a beautiful array with the sum of elements equal to\n\n    s\n. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    5000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n lines follow, the \n    i\n-th\nline contains one integer \n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 s \n    \u2264 5000\n) for the\n\n    i\n-th test case. Output Print \n    t\n integers, the \n    i\n-th integer\nshould be the answer for the \n    i\n-th testcase: the minimum possible size of\na beautiful array with the sum of elements equal to \n    s\n. Example Input 4 1\n8 7 42 Output 1 3 3 7 Note Consider the example test: in the first test case,\nthe array \n    [1]\n meets all conditions; in the second test case, the array\n\n    [3, 4, 1]\n meets all conditions; in the third test case, the array \n    [1,\n    2, 4]\n meets all conditions; in the fourth test case, the array \n    [1, 4, 6,\n    8, 10, 2, 11]\n meets all conditions.\n\n",
