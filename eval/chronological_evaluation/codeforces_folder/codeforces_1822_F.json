        "description": "Two friends, Alisa and Yuki, planted a tree with \n    n\n vertices in their\ngarden. A tree is an undirected graph without cycles, loops, or multiple\nedges. Each edge in this tree has a length of \n    k\n. Initially, vertex\n\n    1\n is the root of the tree. Alisa and Yuki are growing the tree not just\nfor fun, they want to sell it. The cost of the tree is defined as the maximum\ndistance from the root to a vertex among all vertices of the tree. The\ndistance between two vertices \n    u\n and \n    v\n is the sum of the lengths of\nthe edges on the path from \n    u\n to \n    v\n. The girls took a course in\ngardening, so they know how to modify the tree. Alisa and Yuki can spend\n\n    c\n coins to shift the root of the tree to one of the neighbors of the\ncurrent root. This operation can be performed any number of times (possibly\nzero). Note that the structure of the tree is left unchanged; the only change\nis which vertex is the root. The friends want to sell the tree with the\nmaximum profit. The profit is defined as the difference between the cost of\nthe tree and the total cost of operations. The profit is cost of the tree\nminus the total cost of operations. Help the girls and find the maximum profit\nthey can get by applying operations to the tree any number of times (possibly\nzero). Input The first line of the input contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test\ncases follows. The first line of each test case contains integers \n    n\n,\n\n    k\n, \n    c\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 k, c \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree, the length of each edge, and\nthe cost of the operation. The next \n    n - 1\n lines of the test case contain\npairs of integers \n    u_i\n, \n    v_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the\nedges of the graph. These edges form a tree. The sum of the values of \n    n\n\nover all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test\ncase, output a single integer \u2014 the maximum profit that Yuki and Alisa can\nget.
