        "description": "William has two numbers \n    a\n and \n    b\n initially both equal to zero.\nWilliam mastered performing three different operations with them quickly.\nBefore performing each operation some positive integer \n    k\n is picked,\nwhich is then used to perform one of the following operations: (note, that for\neach operation you can choose a new positive integer \n    k\n) add number\n\n    k\n to both \n    a\n and \n    b\n, or add number \n    k\n to \n    a\n and\nsubtract \n    k\n from \n    b\n, or add number \n    k\n to \n    b\n and subtract\n\n    k\n from \n    a\n. Note that after performing operations, numbers \n    a\n\nand \n    b\n may become negative as well. William wants to find out the minimal\nnumber of operations he would have to perform to make \n    a\n equal to his\nfavorite number \n    c\n and \n    b\n equal to his second favorite number\n\n    d\n. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains\nthe number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). Description of\nthe test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers\n\n    c\n and \n    d\n \n    (0 \n    \u2264 c, d \n    \u2264 10^9)\n, which are William's\nfavorite numbers and which he wants \n    a\n and \n    b\n to be transformed\ninto. Output For each test case output a single number, which is the minimal\nnumber of operations which William would have to perform to make \n    a\n equal\nto \n    c\n and \n    b\n equal to \n    d\n, or \n    -1\n if it is impossible to\nachieve this using the described operations. Example Input 6 1 2 3 5 5 3 6 6 8\n0 0 0 Output -1 2 2 1 2 0 Note Let us demonstrate one of the suboptimal ways\nof getting a pair \n    (3, 5)\n: Using an operation of the first type with\n\n    k=1\n, the current pair would be equal to \n    (1, 1)\n. Using an operation\nof the third type with \n    k=8\n, the current pair would be equal to \n    (-7,\n    9)\n. Using an operation of the second type with \n    k=7\n, the current pair\nwould be equal to \n    (0, 2)\n. Using an operation of the first type with\n\n    k=3\n, the current pair would be equal to \n    (3, 5)\n.\n\n",
