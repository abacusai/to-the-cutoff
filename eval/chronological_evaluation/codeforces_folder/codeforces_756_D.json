        "description": "Julia is conducting an experiment in her lab. She placed several luminescent\nbacterial colonies in a horizontal testtube. Different types of bacteria can\nbe distinguished by the color of light they emit. Julia marks types of\nbacteria with small Latin letters \"a\", ..., \"z\". The testtube is divided into\nn consecutive regions. Each region is occupied by a single colony of a certain\nbacteria type at any given moment. Hence, the population of the testtube at\nany moment can be described by a string of n Latin characters. Sometimes a\ncolony can decide to conquer another colony in one of the adjacent regions.\nWhen that happens, the attacked colony is immediately eliminated and replaced\nby a colony of the same type as the attacking colony, while the attacking\ncolony keeps its type. Note that a colony can only attack its neighbours\nwithin the boundaries of the testtube. At any moment, at most one attack can\ntake place. For example, consider a testtube with population \"babb\". There are\nsix options for an attack that may happen next: the first colony attacks the\nsecond colony (1 \u2192 2), the resulting population is \"bbbb\"; 2 \u2192 1, the result\nis \"aabb\"; 2 \u2192 3, the result is \"baab\"; 3 \u2192 2, the result is \"bbbb\" (note that\nthe result is the same as the first option); 3 \u2192 4 or 4 \u2192 3, the population\ndoes not change.The pattern of attacks is rather unpredictable. Julia is now\nwondering how many different configurations of bacteria in the testtube she\ncan obtain after a sequence of attacks takes place (it is possible that no\nattacks will happen at all). Since this number can be large, find it modulo\n10^9 + 7. Input The first line contains an integer n \u2014 the number of regions\nin the testtube (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5 000). The second line contains n small Latin\nletters that describe the initial population of the testtube. Output Print one\nnumber \u2014 the answer to the problem modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input 3 aaa\nOutput 1 Input 2 ab Output 3 Input 4 babb Output 11 Input 7 abacaba Output 589\nNote In the first sample the population can never change since all bacteria\nare of the same type. In the second sample three configurations are possible:\n\"ab\" (no attacks), \"aa\" (the first colony conquers the second colony), and\n\"bb\" (the second colony conquers the first colony). To get the answer for the\nthird sample, note that more than one attack can happen.\n\n",
