        "description": "Spring has come, and the management of the AvtoBus bus fleet has given the\norder to replace winter tires with summer tires on all buses. You own a small\nbus service business and you have just received an order to replace \n    n\n\ntires. You know that the bus fleet owns two types of buses: with two axles\n(these buses have \n    4\n wheels) and with three axles (these buses have\n\n    6\n wheels). You don't know how many buses of which type the AvtoBus bus\nfleet owns, so you wonder how many buses the fleet might have. You have to\ndetermine the minimum and the maximum number of buses that can be in the fleet\nif you know that the total number of wheels for all buses is \n    n\n. Input\nThe first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1\n     000\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. The following lines contain description of test\ncases. The only line of each test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^18\n) \u2014 the total number of wheels for all buses. Output\nFor each test case print the answer in a single line using the following\nformat. Print two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 y\n) \u2014 the\nminimum and the maximum possible number of buses that can be in the bus fleet.\nIf there is no suitable number of buses for the given \n    n\n, print the\nnumber \n    -1\n as the answer. Example Input 4 4 7 24 998244353998244352\nOutput 1 1 -1 4 6 166374058999707392 249561088499561088 Note In the first test\ncase the total number of wheels is \n    4\n. It means that there is the only\none bus with two axles in the bus fleet. In the second test case it's easy to\nshow that there is no suitable number of buses with \n    7\n wheels in total.\nIn the third test case the total number of wheels is \n    24\n. The following\noptions are possible: Four buses with three axles. Three buses with two axles\nand two buses with three axles. Six buses with two axles. So the minimum\nnumber of buses is \n    4\n and the maximum number of buses is \n    6\n.\n\n",
