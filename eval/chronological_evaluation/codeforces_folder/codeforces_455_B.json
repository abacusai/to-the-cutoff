        "description": "Andrew, Fedor and Alex are inventive guys. Now they invent the game with\nstrings for two players. Given a group of n non-empty strings. During the game\ntwo players build the word together, initially the word is empty. The players\nmove in turns. On his step player must add a single letter in the end of the\nword, the resulting word must be prefix of at least one string from the group.\nA player loses if he cannot move. Andrew and Alex decided to play this game k\ntimes. The player who is the loser of the i-th game makes the first move in\nthe (i + 1)-th game. Guys decided that the winner of all games is the player\nwho wins the last (k-th) game. Andrew and Alex already started the game. Fedor\nwants to know who wins the game if both players will play optimally. Help him.\nInput The first line contains two integers, n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5; 1 \u2264 k \u2264\n10^9). Each of the next n lines contains a single non-empty string from the\ngiven group. The total length of all strings from the group doesn't exceed\n10^5. Each string of the group consists only of lowercase English letters.\nOutput If the player who moves first wins, print \"First\", otherwise print\n\"Second\" (without the quotes). Examples Input 2 3 a b Output First Input 3 1 a\nb c Output First Input 1 2 ab Output Second\n\n",
