        "description": "Pay attention: this problem is interactive. Penguin Xoriy came up with a new\ngame recently. He has n icicles numbered from 1 to n. Each icicle has a\ntemperature \u2014 an integer from 1 to 10^9. Exactly two of these icicles are\nspecial: their temperature is y, while a temperature of all the others is x \u2260\ny. You have to find those special icicles. You can choose a non-empty subset\nof icicles and ask the penguin what is the bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of the\ntemperatures of the icicles in this subset. Note that you can't ask more than\n19 questions. You are to find the special icicles. Input The first line\ncontains three integers n, x, y (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^9, x \u2260 y) \u2014 the\nnumber of icicles, the temperature of non-special icicles and the temperature\nof the special icicles. Output To give your answer to the penguin you have to\nprint character \"!\" (without quotes), then print two integers p1, p2 (p1 < p2)\n\u2014 the indexes of the special icicles in ascending order. Note that \"!\" and p1\nshould be separated by a space; the indexes should be separated by a space\ntoo. After you gave the answer your program should terminate immediately.\nInteraction To ask a question print character \"?\" (without quotes), an integer\nc (1 \u2264 c \u2264 n), and c distinct integers p1, p2, ..., pc (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 n) \u2014 the\nindexes of icicles that you want to know about. Note that \"?\" and c should be\nseparated by a space; the indexes should be separated by a space too. After\nyou asked the question, read a single integer \u2014 the answer. Note that you\ncan't ask more than 19 questions. If you ask more than 19 questions or at\nleast one incorrect question, your solution will get \"Wrong answer\". If at\nsome moment your program reads - 1 as an answer, it should immediately exit\n(for example, by calling exit(0)). You will get \"Wrong answer\" in this case,\nit means that you asked more than 19 questions, or asked an invalid question.\nIf you ignore this, you can get other verdicts since your program will\ncontinue to read from a closed stream. Your solution will get \"Idleness Limit\nExceeded\", if you don't print anything or forget to flush the output,\nincluding for the final answer . To flush you can use (just after printing):\nfflush(stdout) in C++; System.out.flush() in Java; stdout.flush() in Python;\nflush(output) in Pascal; For other languages see the documentation. Hacking\nFor hacking use the following format: n x y p1 p2 Here 1 \u2264 p1 < p2 \u2264 n are the\nindexes of the special icicles. Contestant programs will not be able to see\nthis input. Example Input 4 2 1 2 1 1 Output ? 3 1 2 3 ? 1 1 ? 1 3 ! 1 3 Note\nThe answer for the first question is . The answer for the second and the third\nquestions is 1, therefore, special icicles are indexes 1 and 3.
