        "name": "Bears and Juice",
        "description": "There are n bears in the inn and p places to sleep. Bears will party together\nfor some number of nights (and days). Bears love drinking juice. They don't\nlike wine but they can't distinguish it from juice by taste or smell. A bear\ndoesn't sleep unless he drinks wine. A bear must go to sleep a few hours after\ndrinking a wine. He will wake up many days after the party is over. Radewoosh\nis the owner of the inn. He wants to put some number of barrels in front of\nbears. One barrel will contain wine and all other ones will contain juice.\nRadewoosh will challenge bears to find a barrel with wine. Each night, the\nfollowing happens in this exact order: Each bear must choose a (maybe empty)\nset of barrels. The same barrel may be chosen by many bears. Each bear drinks\na glass from each barrel he chose. All bears who drink wine go to sleep\n(exactly those bears who chose a barrel with wine). They will wake up many\ndays after the party is over. If there are not enough places to sleep then\nbears lose immediately. At the end, if it's sure where wine is and there is at\nleast one awake bear then bears win (unless they have lost before because of\nthe number of places to sleep). Radewoosh wants to allow bears to win. He\nconsiders q scenarios. In the i-th scenario the party will last for i nights.\nThen, let Ri denote the maximum number of barrels for which bears surely win\nif they behave optimally. Let's define . Your task is to find , where denotes\nthe exclusive or (also denoted as XOR). Note that the same barrel may be\nchosen by many bears and all of them will go to sleep at once. Input The only\nline of the input contains three integers n, p and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 p \u2264\n130, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 000 000) \u2014 the number of bears, the number of places to sleep\nand the number of scenarios, respectively. Output Print one integer, equal to\n. Examples Input 5 1 3 Output 32 Input 1 100 4 Output 4 Input 3 2 1 Output 7\nInput 100 100 100 Output 381863924 Note In the first sample, there are 5 bears\nand only 1 place to sleep. We have R1 = 6, R2 = 11, R3 = 16 so the answer is .\nLet's analyze the optimal strategy for scenario with 2 days. There are R2 = 11\nbarrels and 10 of them contain juice. In the first night, the i-th bear\nchooses a barrel i only. If one of the first 5 barrels contains wine then one\nbear goes to sleep. Then, bears win because they know where wine is and there\nis at least one awake bear. But let's say none of the first 5 barrels contains\nwine. In the second night, the i-th bear chooses a barrel 5 + i. If one of\nbarrels 6 \u2013 10 contains wine then one bear goes to sleep. And again, bears win\nin such a situation. If nobody went to sleep then wine is in a barrel 11. In\nthe second sample, there is only one bear. He should choose an empty set of\nbarrels in each night. Otherwise, he would maybe get wine and bears would lose\n(because there must be at least one awake bear). So, for any number of days we\nhave Ri = 1. The answer is .\n\n",
