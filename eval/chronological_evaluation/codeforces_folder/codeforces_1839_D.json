        "description": "There are \n    n\n colorful balls arranged in a row. The balls are painted in\n\n    n\n distinct colors, denoted by numbers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. The\n\n    i\n-th ball from the left is painted in color \n    c_i\n. You want to\nreorder the balls so that the \n    i\n-th ball from the left has color \n    i\n.\nAdditionally, you have \n    k \n    \u2265 1\n balls of color \n    0\n that you can use\nin the reordering process. Due to the strange properties of the balls, they\ncan be reordered only by performing the following operations: Place a ball of\ncolor \n    0\n anywhere in the sequence (between any two consecutive balls,\nbefore the leftmost ball or after the rightmost ball) while keeping the\nrelative order of other balls. You can perform this operation no more than\n\n    k\n times, because you have only \n    k\n balls of color \n    0\n. Choose\nany ball of non-zero color such that at least one of the balls adjacent to him\nhas color \n    0\n, and move that ball (of non-zero color) anywhere in the\nsequence (between any two consecutive balls, before the leftmost ball or after\nthe rightmost ball) while keeping the relative order of other balls. You can\nperform this operation as many times as you want, but for each operation you\nshould pay \n    1\n coin. You can perform these operations in any order. After\nthe last operation, all balls of color \n    0\n magically disappear, leaving a\nsequence of \n    n\n balls of non-zero colors. What is the minimum amount of\ncoins you should spend on the operations of the second type, so that the\n\n    i\n-th ball from the left has color \n    i\n for all \n    i\n from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n after the disappearance of all balls of color zero? It can be shown\nthat under the constraints of the problem, it is always possible to reorder\nthe balls in the required way. Solve the problem for all \n    k\n from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n. Input The first line contains integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    500\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.\nThe first line contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 500\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of balls. The second line contains \n    n\n distinct integers \n    c_1,\n    c_2, \n    \u2026, c_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the colors of balls from\nleft to right. It is guaranteed that sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoesn't exceed \n    500\n. Output For each test case, output \n    n\n integers:\nthe \n    i\n-th (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) of them should be equal to the\nminimum amount of coins you need to spend in order to reorder balls in the\nrequired way for \n    k = i\n. Example Input 3 6 2 3 1 4 6 5 3 1 2 3 11 7 3 4 6\n8 9 10 2 5 11 1 Output 3 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 10 5 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 Note In the\nfirst test case there are \n    n = 6\n balls. The colors of the balls from left\nto right are \n    [\n      2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5 \n     ]\n. Let's suppose \n    k = 1\n.\nOne of the ways to reorder the balls in the required way for \n    3\n coins:\n\n    [\n      2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5 \n     ]\n \n    \n \n    [\n     \n    2, 3, 1, 4, \n    0, 6, 5 \n     ]\n \n    \n\n\n    [\n      2, 3, \n    4, 1, 0, 6, 5 \n     ]\n \n    \n \n    [\n     \n    1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 6, 5 \n     ]\n\n\n    \n \n    [\n      1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 5, \n    6\n     ]\n The number above the arrow is the operation type. Balls inserted on\nthe operations of the first type are highlighted red; balls moved on the\noperations of second type are highlighted blue. It can be shown that for \n    k\n    = 1\n it is impossible to rearrange balls in correct order for less than\n\n    3\n coins. Let's suppose \n    k = 2\n. One of the ways to reorder the balls\nin the required way for \n    2\n coins: \n    [\n      2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5 \n     ]\n\n\n    \n \n    [\n      2, 3, 1, 4, 6, \n    0,\n    5\n     ]\n \n    \n \n    [\n      2, 3, 1, 4, 0, 5,\n    \n    6\n     ]\n \n    \n \n    [\n      2, 3,\n    \n    0, 1, 4, 0, 5, 6 \n     ]\n \n    \n\n\n    [\n     \n    1, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 5, 6\n     ]\n Note that this\nsequence of operations is also correct for \n    k\n greater than \n    2\n. It\ncan be shown that for \n    k\n from \n    2\n to \n    6\n it is impossible to\nrearrange balls in correct order for less than \n    2\n coins. In the second\ntest case the balls are already placed in the correct order, so answers for\nall \n    k\n are equal to \n    0\n.\n\n",
