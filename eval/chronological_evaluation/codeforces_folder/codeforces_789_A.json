        "name": "Anastasia and pebbles",
        "description": "Anastasia loves going for a walk in Central Uzhlyandian Park. But she became\nuninterested in simple walking, so she began to collect Uzhlyandian pebbles.\nAt first, she decided to collect all the pebbles she could find in the park.\nShe has only two pockets. She can put at most k pebbles in each pocket at the\nsame time. There are n different pebble types in the park, and there are wi\npebbles of the i-th type. Anastasia is very responsible, so she never mixes\npebbles of different types in same pocket. However, she can put different\nkinds of pebbles in different pockets at the same time. Unfortunately, she\ncan't spend all her time collecting pebbles, so she can collect pebbles from\nthe park only once a day. Help her to find the minimum number of days needed\nto collect all the pebbles of Uzhlyandian Central Park, taking into\nconsideration that Anastasia can't place pebbles of different types in same\npocket. Input The first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264\nk \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of different pebble types and number of pebbles\nAnastasia can place in one pocket. The second line contains n integers w1, w2,\n..., wn (1 \u2264 wi \u2264 10^4) \u2014 number of pebbles of each type. Output The only line\nof output contains one integer \u2014 the minimum number of days Anastasia needs to\ncollect all the pebbles. Examples Input 3 2 2 3 4 Output 3 Input 5 4 3 1 8 9 7\nOutput 5 Note In the first sample case, Anastasia can collect all pebbles of\nthe first type on the first day, of second type \u2014 on the second day, and of\nthird type \u2014 on the third day. Optimal sequence of actions in the second\nsample case: In the first day Anastasia collects 8 pebbles of the third type.\nIn the second day she collects 8 pebbles of the fourth type. In the third day\nshe collects 3 pebbles of the first type and 1 pebble of the fourth type. In\nthe fourth day she collects 7 pebbles of the fifth type. In the fifth day she\ncollects 1 pebble of the second type.\n\n",
