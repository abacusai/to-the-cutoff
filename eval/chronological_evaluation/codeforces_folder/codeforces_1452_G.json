        "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have a tree consisting of \n    n\n\nvertices. Initially, Bob has \n    k\n chips, the \n    i\n-th chip is located in\nthe vertex \n    a_i\n (all these vertices are unique). Before the game starts,\nAlice will place a chip into one of the vertices of the tree. The game\nconsists of turns. Each turn, the following events happen (sequentially,\nexactly in the following order): Alice either moves her chip to an adjacent\nvertex or doesn't move it; for each Bob's chip, he either moves it to an\nadjacent vertex or doesn't move it. Note that this choice is done\nindependently for each chip. The game ends when Alice's chip shares the same\nvertex with one (or multiple) of Bob's chips. Note that Bob's chips may share\nthe same vertex, even though they are in different vertices at the beginning\nof the game. Alice wants to maximize the number of turns, Bob wants to\nminimize it. If the game ends in the middle of some turn (Alice moves her chip\nto a vertex that contains one or multiple Bob's chips), this turn is counted.\nFor each vertex, calculate the number of turns the game will last if Alice\nplaces her chip in that vertex. Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of vertices in the\ntree. Then \n    n - 1\n lines follow, each line contains two integers\n\n    u_i\n, \n    v_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    u_i \n     v_i\n)\nthat denote the endpoints of an edge. These edges form a tree. The next line\ncontains one integer \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n - 1\n) \u2014 the number of\nBob's chips. The last line contains \n    k\n integers \n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n,\n..., \n    a_k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    a_i \n     a_j\n if \n    i \n    \n    j\n) \u2014 the vertices where the Bob's chips are initially placed. Output Print\n\n    n\n integers. The \n    i\n-th of them should be equal to the number of\nturns the game will last if Alice initially places her chip in the vertex\n\n    i\n. If one of Bob's chips is already placed in vertex \n    i\n, then the\nanswer for vertex \n    i\n is \n    0\n.
