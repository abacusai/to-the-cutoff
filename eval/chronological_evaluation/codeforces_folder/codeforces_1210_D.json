        "name": "Konrad and Company Evaluation",
        "description": "Konrad is a Human Relations consultant working for VoltModder, a large\nelectrical equipment producer. Today, he has been tasked with evaluating the\nlevel of happiness in the company. There are \n    n\n people working for\nVoltModder, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Each employee earns a different\namount of money in the company \u2014 initially, the \n    i\n-th person earns\n\n    i\n rubles per day. On each of \n    q\n following days, the salaries will\nbe revised. At the end of the \n    i\n-th day, employee \n    v_i\n will start\nearning \n    n+i\n rubles per day and will become the best-paid person in the\ncompany. The employee will keep his new salary until it gets revised again.\nSome pairs of people don't like each other. This creates a great psychological\ndanger in the company. Formally, if two people \n    a\n and \n    b\n dislike\neach other and \n    a\n earns more money than \n    b\n, employee \n    a\n will\nbrag about this to \n    b\n. A dangerous triple is a triple of three employees\n\n    a\n, \n    b\n and \n    c\n, such that \n    a\n brags to \n    b\n, who in turn\nbrags to \n    c\n. If \n    a\n dislikes \n    b\n, then \n    b\n dislikes \n    a\n.\nAt the beginning of each day, Konrad needs to evaluate the number of dangerous\ntriples in the company. Can you help him do it? Input The first line contains\ntwo integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264\n    m \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of employees in the company and the number\nof pairs of people who don't like each other. Each of the following \n    m\n\nlines contains two integers \n    a_i\n, \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264\n    n\n, \n    a_i \n    \u2260 b_i\n) denoting that employees \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n\nhate each other (that is, \n    a_i\n dislikes \n    b_i\n and \n    b_i\n dislikes\n\n    a_i\n). Each such relationship will be mentioned exactly once. The next\nline contains an integer \n    q\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of salary revisions. The \n    i\n-th of the following \n    q\n lines\ncontains a single integer \n    v_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 v_i \n    \u2264 n\n) denoting that\nat the end of the \n    i\n-th day, employee \n    v_i\n will earn the most.\nOutput Output \n    q + 1\n integers. The \n    i\n-th of them should contain the\nnumber of dangerous triples in the company at the beginning of the \n    i\n-th\nday. Examples Input 4 5 1 2 2 4 1 3 3 4 2 3 2 2 3 Output 4 3 2 Input 3 3 1 2 2\n3 1 3 5 1 2 2 1 3 Output 1 1 1 1 1 1 Note Consider the first sample test. The\n\n    i\n-th row in the following image shows the structure of the company at\nthe beginning of the \n    i\n-th day. A directed edge from \n    a\n to \n    b\n\ndenotes that employee \n    a\n brags to employee \n    b\n. The dangerous triples\nare marked by highlighted edges.\n\n",
