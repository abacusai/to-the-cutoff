        "name": "Jumping on Walls",
        "description": "Vasya plays a computer game with ninjas. At this stage Vasya's ninja should\nget out of a deep canyon. The canyon consists of two vertical parallel walls,\ntheir height is n meters. Let's imagine that we split these walls into 1\nmeter-long areas and number them with positive integers from 1 to n from\nbottom to top. Some areas are safe and the ninja can climb them. Others are\nspiky and ninja can't be there. Let's call such areas dangerous. Initially the\nninja is on the lower area of the left wall. He can use each second to perform\none of the following actions: climb one area up; climb one area down; jump to\nthe opposite wall. That gets the ninja to the area that is exactly k meters\nhigher than the area he jumped from. More formally, if before the jump the\nninja is located at area x of one wall, then after the jump he is located at\narea x + k of the other wall. If at some point of time the ninja tries to get\nto an area with a number larger than n, then we can assume that the ninja got\nout of the canyon. The canyon gets flooded and each second the water level\nraises one meter. Initially the water level is at the lower border of the\nfirst area. Ninja cannot be on the area covered by water. We can assume that\nthe ninja and the water \"move in turns\" \u2014 first the ninja performs some\naction, then the water raises for one meter, then the ninja performs one more\naction and so on. The level is considered completed if the ninja manages to\nget out of the canyon. After several failed attempts Vasya started to doubt\nwhether it is possible to complete the level at all. Help him answer the\nquestion. Input The first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 10^5)\n\u2014 the height of the canyon and the height of ninja's jump, correspondingly.\nThe second line contains the description of the left wall \u2014 a string with the\nlength of n characters. The i-th character represents the state of the i-th\nwall area: character \"X\" represents a dangerous area and character \"-\"\nrepresents a safe area. The third line describes the right wall in the same\nformat. It is guaranteed that the first area of the left wall is not\ndangerous. Output Print \"YES\" (without the quotes) if the ninja can get out\nfrom the canyon, otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes). Examples Input 7\n3 \u00ad\u2013X\u2013X -X\u2013XX- Output YES Input 6 2 \u00ad-X-X- X\u2013XX- Output NO Note In the\nfirst sample the ninja should first jump to the right wall, then go one meter\ndown along the right wall, then jump to the left wall. The next jump can get\nthe ninja from the canyon. In the second sample there's no way the ninja can\nget out of the canyon.\n\n",
