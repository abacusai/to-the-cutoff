        "description": "Kristina has two arrays \n    a\n and \n    b\n, each containing \n    n\n non-\nnegative integers. She can perform the following operation on array \n    a\n\nany number of times: apply a decrement to each non-zero element of the array,\nthat is, replace the value of each element \n    a_i\n such that \n    a_i > 0\n\nwith the value \n    a_i - 1\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n). If \n    a_i\n was\n\n    0\n, its value does not change. Determine whether Kristina can get an\narray \n    b\n from an array \n    a\n in some number of operations (probably\nzero). In other words, can she make \n    a_i = b_i\n after some number of\noperations for each \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n? For example, let \n    n = 4\n,\n\n    a = [3, 5, 4, 1]\n and \n    b = [1, 3, 2, 0]\n. In this case, she can apply\nthe operation twice: after the first application of the operation she gets\n\n    a = [2, 4, 3, 0]\n; after the second use of the operation she gets \n    a =\n    [1, 3, 2, 0]\n. Thus, in two operations, she can get an array \n    b\n from an\narray \n    a\n. Input The first line of the input contains an integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014the number of test cases in the test. The\ndescriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n). The\nsecond line of each test case contains exactly \n    n\n non-negative integers\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). The third line of\neach test case contains exactly \n    n\n non-negative integers \n    b_1, b_2,\n    \n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is guaranteed that the sum\nof \n    n\n values over all test cases in the test does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output on a separate line: YES, if by\ndoing some number of operations it is possible to get an array \n    b\n from an\narray \n    a\n; NO otherwise. You can output YES and NO in any case (for\nexample, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive\nresponse). Example Input 6 4 3 5 4 1 1 3 2 0 3 1 2 1 0 1 0 4 5 3 7 2 1 1 1 1 5\n1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 6 1 8 0 1 4 6 Output YES YES NO NO YES NO Note The first\ntest case is analyzed in the statement. In the second test case, it is enough\nto apply the operation to array \n    a\n once. In the third test case, it is\nimpossible to get array \n    b\n from array \n    a\n.\n\n",
