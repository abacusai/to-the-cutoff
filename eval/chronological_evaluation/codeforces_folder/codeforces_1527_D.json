        "description": "You are given a tree with \n    n\n nodes, numerated from \n    0\n to \n    n-1\n.\nFor each \n    k\n between \n    0\n and \n    n\n, inclusive, you have to count the\nnumber of unordered pairs \n    (u,v)\n, \n    u \n    \u2260 v\n, such that the MEX of\nall the node labels in the shortest path from \n    u\n to \n    v\n (including\nend points) is \n    k\n. The MEX of a sequence of integers is the smallest non-\nnegative integer that does not belong to the sequence. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The next \n    n-1\n lines of each\ntest case describe the tree that has to be constructed. These lines contain\ntwo integers \n    u\n and \n    v\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 u,v \n    \u2264 n-1\n) denoting an\nedge between \n    u\n and \n    v\n (\n    u \n    \u2260 v\n). It is guaranteed that the\ngiven edges form a tree. It is also guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n for all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case,\nprint \n    n+1\n integers: the number of paths in the tree, such that the MEX\nof all the node labels in that path is \n    k\n for each \n    k\n from \n    0\n\nto \n    n\n. Example Input 2 4 0 1 0 2 2 3 2 1 0 Output 1 2 1 1 1 0 0 1 Note In\nexample case \n    1\n, For \n    k = 0\n, there is \n    1\n path that is from\n\n    2\n to \n    3\n as \n    MEX([2, 3]) = 0\n. For \n    k = 1\n, there are\n\n    2\n paths that is from \n    0\n to \n    2\n as \n    MEX([0, 2]) = 1\n and\n\n    0\n to \n    3\n as \n    MEX([0, 2, 3]) = 1\n. For \n    k = 2\n, there is\n\n    1\n path that is from \n    0\n to \n    1\n as \n    MEX([0, 1]) = 2\n. For\n\n    k = 3\n, there is \n    1\n path that is from \n    1\n to \n    2\n as\n\n    MEX([1, 0, 2]) = 3\n For \n    k = 4\n, there is \n    1\n path that is from\n\n    1\n to \n    3\n as \n    MEX([1, 0, 2, 3]) = 4\n. In example case \n    2\n,\nFor \n    k = 0\n, there are no such paths. For \n    k = 1\n, there are no such\npaths. For \n    k = 2\n, there is \n    1\n path that is from \n    0\n to \n    1\n\nas \n    MEX([0, 1]) = 2\n.\n\n",
