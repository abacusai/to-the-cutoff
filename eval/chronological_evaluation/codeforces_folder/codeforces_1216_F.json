        "description": "You work as a system administrator in a dormitory, which has \n    n\n rooms one\nafter another along a straight hallway. Rooms are numbered from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n. You have to connect all \n    n\n rooms to the Internet. You can\nconnect each room to the Internet directly, the cost of such connection for\nthe \n    i\n-th room is \n    i\n coins. Some rooms also have a spot for a\nrouter. The cost of placing a router in the \n    i\n-th room is also \n    i\n\ncoins. You cannot place a router in a room which does not have a spot for it.\nWhen you place a router in the room \n    i\n, you connect all rooms with the\nnumbers from \n    max(1,\u00a0i - k)\n to \n    min(n,\u00a0i + k)\n inclusive to the\nInternet, where \n    k\n is the range of router. The value of \n    k\n is the\nsame for all routers. Calculate the minimum total cost of connecting all\n\n    n\n rooms to the Internet. You can assume that the number of rooms which\nhave a spot for a router is not greater than the number of routers you have.\nInput The first line of the input contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, k \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of rooms and the range\nof each router. The second line of the input contains one string \n    s\n of\nlength \n    n\n, consisting only of zeros and ones. If the \n    i\n-th character\nof the string equals to '1' then there is a spot for a router in the\n\n    i\n-th room. If the \n    i\n-th character of the string equals to '0' then\nyou cannot place a router in the \n    i\n-th room. Output Print one integer \u2014\nthe minimum total cost of connecting all \n    n\n rooms to the Internet.\nExamples Input 5 2 00100 Output 3 Input 6 1 000000 Output 21 Input 4 1 0011\nOutput 4 Input 12 6 000010000100 Output 15 Note In the first example it is\nenough to place the router in the room \n    3\n, then all rooms will be\nconnected to the Internet. The total cost of connection is \n    3\n. In the\nsecond example you can place routers nowhere, so you need to connect all rooms\ndirectly. Thus, the total cost of connection of all rooms is \n    1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n    + 5 + 6 = 21\n. In the third example you need to connect the room \n    1\n\ndirectly and place the router in the room \n    3\n. Thus, the total cost of\nconnection of all rooms is \n    1 + 3 = 4\n. In the fourth example you need to\nplace routers in rooms \n    5\n and \n    10\n. Then all rooms will be connected\nto the Internet. The total cost of connection is \n    5 + 10 = 15\n.\n\n",
