        "description": "You are given two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n, and \n    q\n queries. The\n\n    i\n-th query consists of two numbers \n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n, and the\nanswer to it is the number of integers \n    x\n such that \n    l_i \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264\n    r_i\n, and \n    ((x \n     a) \n     b) \n     ((x \n     b) \n     a)\n.\nCalculate the answer for each query. Recall that \n    y \n     z\n is the\nremainder of the division of \n    y\n by \n    z\n. For example, \n    5 \n     3 =\n    2\n, \n    7 \n     8 = 7\n, \n    9 \n     4 = 1\n, \n    9 \n     9 = 0\n.\nInput The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. The first line of each\ntest case contains three integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n and \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a,\n    b \n    \u2264 200\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 500\n). Then \n    q\n lines follow, each\ncontaining two integers \n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^18\n) for the corresponding query. Output For each test case,\nprint \n    q\n integers \u2014 the answers to the queries of this test case in the\norder they appear. Example Input 2 4 6 5 1 1 1 3 1 5 1 7 1 9 7 10 2 7 8 100\n200 Output 0 0 0 2 4 0 91\n\n",
