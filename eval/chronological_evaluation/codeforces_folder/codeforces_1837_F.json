        "name": "Editorial for Two",
        "description": "Berland Intercollegiate Contest has just finished. Monocarp and Polycarp, as\nthe jury, are going to conduct an editorial. Unfortunately, the time is\nlimited, since they have to finish before the closing ceremony. There were\n\n    n\n problems in the contest. The problems are numbered from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n. The editorial for the \n    i\n-th problem takes \n    a_i\n minutes.\nMonocarp and Polycarp are going to conduct an editorial for exactly \n    k\n of\nthe problems. The editorial goes as follows. They have a full problemset of\n\n    n\n problems before them, in order. They remove \n    n - k\n problems\nwithout changing the order of the remaining \n    k\n problems. Then, Monocarp\ntakes some prefix of these \n    k\n problems (possibly, an empty one or all\nproblems). Polycarp takes the remaining suffix of them. After that, they go to\ndifferent rooms and conduct editorials for their problems in parallel. So, the\neditorial takes as much time as the longer of these two does. Please, help\nMonocarp and Polycarp to choose the problems and the split in such a way that\nthe editorial finishes as early as possible. Print the duration of the\neditorial. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of problems in the full problemset and the\nnumber of problems Monocarp and Polycarp are going to conduct an editorial\nfor. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the time each editorial takes. The sum of\n\n    n\n over all testcases doesn't exceed \n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach testcase, print a single integer \u2014 the smallest amount of time the\neditorial takes, if Monocarp and Polycarp can choose which \n    k\n of \n    n\n\nproblems to conduct an editorial for and how to split them among themselves.\nExample Input 6 5 4 1 10 1 1 1 5 3 1 20 5 15 3 5 3 1 20 3 15 5 10 6 10 8 20 14\n3 8 6 4 16 11 10 5 9 9 2 13 15 19 4 9 13 12 1 1 1 Output 2 6 5 21 18 1\n\n",
