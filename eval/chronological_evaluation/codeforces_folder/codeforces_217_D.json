        "name": "Bitonix' Patrol",
        "description": "Byteland is trying to send a space mission onto the Bit-X planet. Their task\nis complicated by the fact that the orbit of the planet is regularly patrolled\nby Captain Bitonix, the leader of the space forces of Bit-X. There are n\nstations around Bit-X numbered clockwise from 1 to n. The stations are evenly\nplaced on a circular orbit, so the stations number i and i + 1 (1 \u2264 i < n),\nand the stations number 1 and n, are neighboring. The distance between every\npair of adjacent stations is equal to m space miles. To go on a patrol,\nCaptain Bitonix jumps in his rocket at one of the stations and flies in a\ncircle, covering a distance of at least one space mile, before finishing in\nsome (perhaps the starting) station. Bitonix' rocket moves by burning fuel\ntanks. After Bitonix attaches an x-liter fuel tank and chooses the direction\n(clockwise or counter-clockwise), the rocket flies exactly x space miles along\na circular orbit in the chosen direction. Note that the rocket has no brakes;\nit is not possible for the rocket to stop before depleting a fuel tank. For\nexample, assume that n = 3 and m = 60 and Bitonix has fuel tanks with volumes\nof 10, 60, 90 and 100 liters. If Bitonix starts from station 1, uses the\n100-liter fuel tank to go clockwise, then uses the 90-liter fuel tank to go\nclockwise, and then uses the 10-liter fuel tank to go counterclockwise, he\nwill finish back at station 1. This constitutes a valid patrol. Note that\nBitonix does not have to use all available fuel tanks. Another valid option\nfor Bitonix in this example would be to simply use the 60-liter fuel tank to\nfly to either station 2 or 3. However, if n was equal to 3, m was equal to 60\nand the only fuel tanks available to Bitonix were one 10-liter tank and one\n100-liter tank, he would have no way of completing a valid patrol (he wouldn't\nbe able to finish any patrol exactly at the station). The Byteland space\nagency wants to destroy some of Captain Bitonix' fuel tanks so that he cannot\nto complete any valid patrol. Find how many different subsets of the tanks the\nagency can destroy to prevent Captain Bitonix from completing a patrol and\noutput the answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Input The first line of the\ninput contains three integers n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of stations, m (1\n\u2264 m \u2264 120) \u2014 the distance between adjacent stations, and t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014\nthe number of fuel tanks owned by Captain Bitonix. The second line of the\ninput contains t space-separated integers between 1 and 10^9, inclusive \u2014 the\nvolumes of Bitonix' fuel tanks. Output Output a single number \u2014 the number of\ndistinct subsets of tanks that the Bytelandian space agency can destroy in\norder to prevent Captain Bitonix from completing a patrol, modulo 10^9 + 7.\nExamples Input 7 6 5 5 4 12 6 5 Output 6 Input 3 60 2 10 100 Output 4 Note All\nthe fuel tanks are distinct, even if some of them have the same capacity.\n\n",
