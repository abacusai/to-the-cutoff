        "description": "Calendars in widespread use today include the Gregorian calendar, which is the\nde facto international standard, and is used almost everywhere in the world\nfor civil purposes. The Gregorian reform modified the Julian calendar's scheme\nof leap years as follows: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a\nleap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100; the centurial\nyears that are exactly divisible by 400 are still leap years. For example, the\nyear 1900 is not a leap year; the year 2000 is a leap year. In this problem,\nyou have been given two dates and your task is to calculate how many days are\nbetween them. Note, that leap years have unusual number of days in February.\nLook at the sample to understand what borders are included in the aswer. Input\nThe first two lines contain two dates, each date is in the format yyyy:mm:dd\n(1900 \u2264 yyyy \u2264 2038 and yyyy:mm:dd is a legal date). Output Print a single\ninteger \u2014 the answer to the problem. Examples Input 1900:01:01 2038:12:31\nOutput 50768 Input 1996:03:09 1991:11:12 Output 1579\n\n",
