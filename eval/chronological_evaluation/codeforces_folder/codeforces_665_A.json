        "description": "Buses run between the cities A and B, the first one is at 05:00 AM and the\nlast one departs not later than at 11:59 PM. A bus from the city A departs\nevery a minutes and arrives to the city B in a ta minutes, and a bus from the\ncity B departs every b minutes and arrives to the city A in a tb minutes. The\ndriver Simion wants to make his job diverse, so he counts the buses going\ntowards him. Simion doesn't count the buses he meet at the start and finish.\nYou know the time when Simion departed from the city A to the city B.\nCalculate the number of buses Simion will meet to be sure in his counting.\nInput The first line contains two integers a, ta (1 \u2264 a, ta \u2264 120) \u2014 the\nfrequency of the buses from the city A to the city B and the travel time. Both\nvalues are given in minutes. The second line contains two integers b, tb (1 \u2264\nb, tb \u2264 120) \u2014 the frequency of the buses from the city B to the city A and\nthe travel time. Both values are given in minutes. The last line contains the\ndeparture time of Simion from the city A in the format hh:mm. It is guaranteed\nthat there are a bus from the city A at that time. Note that the hours and the\nminutes are given with exactly two digits. Output Print the only integer z \u2014\nthe number of buses Simion will meet on the way. Note that you should not\ncount the encounters in cities A and B. Examples Input 10 30 10 35 05:20\nOutput 5 Input 60 120 24 100 13:00 Output 9 Note In the first example Simion\ndeparts form the city A at 05:20 AM and arrives to the city B at 05:50 AM. He\nwill meet the first 5 buses from the city B that departed in the period [05:00\nAM - 05:40 AM]. Also Simion will meet a bus in the city B at 05:50 AM, but he\nwill not count it. Also note that the first encounter will be between 05:26 AM\nand 05:27 AM (if we suggest that the buses are go with the sustained speed).\n\n",
