        "description": "Everybody knows that the Berland citizens are keen on health, especially\nstudents. Berland students are so tough that all they drink is orange juice!\nYesterday one student, Vasya and his mates made some barbecue and they drank\nthis healthy drink only. After they ran out of the first barrel of juice, they\ndecided to play a simple game. All n people who came to the barbecue sat in a\ncircle (thus each person received a unique index bi from 0 to n - 1). The\nperson number 0 started the game (this time it was Vasya). All turns in the\ngame were numbered by integers starting from 1. If the j-th turn was made by\nthe person with index bi, then this person acted like that: he pointed at the\nperson with index (bi + 1) mod n either with an elbow or with a nod (x mod y\nis the remainder after dividing x by y); if j \u2265 4 and the players who had\nturns number j - 1, j - 2, j - 3, made during their turns the same moves as\nplayer bi on the current turn, then he had drunk a glass of juice; the turn\nwent to person number (bi + 1) mod n. The person who was pointed on the last\nturn did not make any actions. The problem was, Vasya's drunk too much juice\nand can't remember the goal of the game. However, Vasya's got the recorded\nsequence of all the participants' actions (including himself). Now Vasya wants\nto find out the maximum amount of juice he could drink if he played optimally\nwell (the other players' actions do not change). Help him. You can assume that\nin any scenario, there is enough juice for everybody. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer n (4 \u2264 n \u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of participants in the\ngame. The second line describes the actual game: the i-th character of this\nline equals 'a', if the participant who moved i-th pointed at the next person\nwith his elbow, and 'b', if the participant pointed with a nod. The game\ncontinued for at least 1 and at most 2000 turns. Output Print a single integer\n\u2014 the number of glasses of juice Vasya could have drunk if he had played\noptimally well. Examples Input 4 abbba Output 1 Input 4 abbab Output 0 Note In\nboth samples Vasya has got two turns \u2014 1 and 5. In the first sample, Vasya\ncould have drunk a glass of juice during the fifth turn if he had pointed at\nthe next person with a nod. In this case, the sequence of moves would look\nlike \"abbbb\". In the second sample Vasya wouldn't drink a single glass of\njuice as the moves performed during turns 3 and 4 are different.\n\n",
