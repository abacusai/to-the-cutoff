        "description": "It\u2019s riot time on football stadium Ramacana! Raging fans have entered the\nfield and the police find themselves in a difficult situation. The field can\nbe represented as a square in the coordinate system defined by two diagonal\nvertices in (0,0) and (10^5, 10^5). The sides of that square are also\nconsidered to be inside the field, everything else is outside. In the\nbeginning, there are N fans on the field. For each fan we are given his speed,\nan integer vi as well as his integer coordinates (xi, yi). A fan with those\ncoordinates might move and after one second he might be at any point (xi + p,\nyi + q) where 0 \u2264 |p| + |q| \u2264 vi. p, q are both integers. Points that go\noutside of the square that represents the field are excluded and all others\nhave equal probability of being the location of that specific fan after one\nsecond. Andrej, a young and promising police officer, has sent a flying drone\nto take a photo of the riot from above. The drone\u2019s camera works like this: It\nselects three points with integer coordinates such that there is a chance of a\nfan appearing there after one second. They must not be collinear or the camera\nwon\u2019t work. It is guaranteed that not all of the initial positions of fans\nwill be on the same line. Camera focuses those points and creates a circle\nthat passes through those three points. A photo is taken after one second (one\nsecond after the initial state). Everything that is on the circle or inside it\nat the moment of taking the photo (one second after focusing the points) will\nbe on the photo. Your goal is to select those three points so that the\nexpected number of fans seen on the photo is maximized. If there are more such\nselections, select those three points that give the circle with largest radius\namong them. If there are still more suitable selections, any one of them will\nbe accepted. If your answer follows conditions above and radius of circle you\nreturn is smaller then the optimal one by 0.01, your output will be considered\nas correct. No test will have optimal radius bigger than 10^10. Input The\nfirst line contains the number of fans on the field, N. The next N lines\ncontain three integers: xi ,yi, vi. They are the x-coordinate, y-coordinate\nand speed of fan i at the beginning of the one second interval considered in\nthe task. 3 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5 0 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 10^5 0 \u2264 vi \u2264 1000 All numbers are\nintegers Output You need to output the three points that camera needs to\nselect. Print them in three lines, with every line containing the\nx-coordinate, then y-coordinate, separated by a single space. The order of\npoints does not matter. Examples Input 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 Output 2 2 2 1 1 0\n\n",
