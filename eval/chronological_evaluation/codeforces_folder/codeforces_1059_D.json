        "description": "There is a forest that we model as a plane and live \n    n\n rare animals.\nAnimal number \n    i\n has its lair in the point \n    (x_i, y_i)\n. In order\nto protect them, a decision to build a nature reserve has been made. The\nreserve must have a form of a circle containing all lairs. There is also a\nstraight river flowing through the forest. All animals drink from this river,\ntherefore it must have at least one common point with the reserve. On the\nother hand, ships constantly sail along the river, so the reserve must not\nhave more than one common point with the river. For convenience, scientists\nhave made a transformation of coordinates so that the river is defined by \n    y\n    = 0\n. Check whether it is possible to build a reserve, and if possible, find\nthe minimum possible radius of such a reserve. Input The first line contains\none integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of animals. Each\nof the next \n    n\n lines contains two integers \n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n\n(\n    -10^7 \n    \u2264 x_i, y_i\n    \u2264 10^7\n) \u2014 the coordinates of the\n\n    i\n-th animal's lair. It is guaranteed that \n    y_i\n    \u2260 0\n. No two\nlairs coincide. Output If the reserve cannot be built, print \n    -1\n.\nOtherwise print the minimum radius. Your answer will be accepted if absolute\nor relative error does not exceed \n    10^-6\n. Formally, let your answer be\n\n    a\n, and the jury's answer be \n    b\n. Your answer is considered correct\nif \n    |a - b|/\n    max(1, |b|)\n    \u2264 10^-6\n. Examples Input 1 0\n1 Output 0.5 Input 3 0 1 0 2 0 -3 Output -1 Input 2 0 1 1 1 Output 0.625 Note\nIn the first sample it is optimal to build the reserve with the radius equal\nto \n    0.5\n and the center in \n    (0,\n     0.5)\n. In the second sample it is\nimpossible to build a reserve. In the third sample it is optimal to build the\nreserve with the radius equal to \n    5/8\n and the center in\n\n    (\n    1/2,\n     \n    5/8)\n.\n\n",
