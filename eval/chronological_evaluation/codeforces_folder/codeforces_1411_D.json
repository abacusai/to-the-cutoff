        "description": "Currently, XXOC's rap is a string consisting of zeroes, ones, and question\nmarks. Unfortunately, haters gonna hate. They will write \n    x\n angry\ncomments for every occurrence of subsequence 01 and \n    y\n angry comments for\nevery occurrence of subsequence 10. You should replace all the question marks\nwith 0 or 1 in such a way that the number of angry comments would be as small\nas possible. String \n    b\n is a subsequence of string \n    a\n, if it can be\nobtained by removing some characters from \n    a\n. Two occurrences of a\nsubsequence are considered distinct if sets of positions of remaining\ncharacters are distinct. Input The first line contains string \n    s\n \u2014 XXOC's\nrap (\n    1 \n    \u2264 |s| \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The second line contains two integers\n\n    x\n and \n    y\n \u2014 the number of angry comments XXOC will recieve for every\noccurrence of 01 and 10 accordingly (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 10^6\n). Output\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of angry comments. Examples Input\n0?1 2 3 Output 4 Input ????? 13 37 Output 0 Input ?10? 239 7 Output 28 Input\n01101001 5 7 Output 96 Note In the first example one of the optimum ways to\nreplace is 001. Then there will be \n    2\n subsequences 01 and \n    0\n\nsubsequences 10. Total number of angry comments will be equal to \n    2 \n    \u00b7\n    2 + 0 \n    \u00b7 3 = 4\n. In the second example one of the optimum ways to\nreplace is 11111. Then there will be \n    0\n subsequences 01 and \n    0\n\nsubsequences 10. Total number of angry comments will be equal to \n    0 \n    \u00b7\n    13 + 0 \n    \u00b7 37 = 0\n. In the third example one of the optimum ways to\nreplace is 1100. Then there will be \n    0\n subsequences 01 and \n    4\n\nsubsequences 10. Total number of angry comments will be equal to \n    0 \n    \u00b7\n    239 + 4 \n    \u00b7 7 = 28\n. In the fourth example one of the optimum ways to\nreplace is 01101001. Then there will be \n    8\n subsequences 01 and \n    8\n\nsubsequences 10. Total number of angry comments will be equal to \n    8 \n    \u00b7\n    5 + 8 \n    \u00b7 7 = 96\n.\n\n",
