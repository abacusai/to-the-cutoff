        "description": "There are n cities in Bearland, numbered 1 through n. Cities are arranged in\none long row. The distance between cities i and j is equal to |i - j|. Limak\nis a police officer. He lives in a city a. His job is to catch criminals. It's\nhard because he doesn't know in which cities criminals are. Though, he knows\nthat there is at most one criminal in each city. Limak is going to use a BCD\n(Bear Criminal Detector). The BCD will tell Limak how many criminals there are\nfor every distance from a city a. After that, Limak can catch a criminal in\neach city for which he is sure that there must be a criminal. You know in\nwhich cities criminals are. Count the number of criminals Limak will catch,\nafter he uses the BCD. Input The first line of the input contains two integers\nn and a (1 \u2264 a \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of cities and the index of city where\nLimak lives. The second line contains n integers t1, t2, ..., tn (0 \u2264 ti \u2264 1).\nThere are ti criminals in the i-th city. Output Print the number of criminals\nLimak will catch. Examples Input 6 3 1 1 1 0 1 0 Output 3 Input 5 2 0 0 0 1 0\nOutput 1 Note In the first sample, there are six cities and Limak lives in the\nthird one (blue arrow below). Criminals are in cities marked red. Using the\nBCD gives Limak the following information: There is one criminal at distance 0\nfrom the third city \u2014 Limak is sure that this criminal is exactly in the third\ncity. There is one criminal at distance 1 from the third city \u2014 Limak doesn't\nknow if a criminal is in the second or fourth city. There are two criminals at\ndistance 2 from the third city \u2014 Limak is sure that there is one criminal in\nthe first city and one in the fifth city. There are zero criminals for every\ngreater distance. So, Limak will catch criminals in cities 1, 3 and 5, that is\n3 criminals in total. In the second sample (drawing below), the BCD gives\nLimak the information that there is one criminal at distance 2 from Limak's\ncity. There is only one city at distance 2 so Limak is sure where a criminal\nis.\n\n",
