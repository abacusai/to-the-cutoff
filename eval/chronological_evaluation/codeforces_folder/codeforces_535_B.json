That's why Keione told his\nsmart friend, SaDDas to punish him! SaDDas took Tavas' headphones and told\nhim: \"If you solve the following problem, I'll return it to you.\" The problem\nis: You are given a lucky number n. Lucky numbers are the positive integers\nwhose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For\nexample, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not. If we sort all\nlucky numbers in increasing order, what's the 1-based index of n? Tavas is not\nas smart as SaDDas, so he asked you to do him a favor and solve this problem\nso he can have his headphones back. Input The first and only line of input\ncontains a lucky number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9). Output Print the index of n among\nall lucky numbers. Examples Input 4 Output 1 Input 7 Output 2 Input 77 Output\n6\n\n",
