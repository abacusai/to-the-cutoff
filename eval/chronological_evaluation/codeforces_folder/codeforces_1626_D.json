        "description": "Monocarp is planning to host a martial arts tournament. There will be three\ndivisions based on weight: lightweight, middleweight and heavyweight. The\nwinner of each division will be determined by a single elimination system. In\nparticular, that implies that the number of participants in each division\nshould be a power of two. Additionally, each division should have a non-zero\namount of participants. \n    n\n participants have registered for the\ntournament so far, the \n    i\n-th of them weighs \n    a_i\n. To split\nparticipants into divisions, Monocarp is going to establish two integer weight\nboundaries \n    x\n and \n    y\n (\n    x < y\n). All participants who weigh\nstrictly less than \n    x\n will be considered lightweight. All participants\nwho weigh greater or equal to \n    y\n will be considered heavyweight. The\nremaining participants will be considered middleweight. It's possible that the\ndistribution doesn't make the number of participants in each division a power\nof two. It can also lead to empty divisions. To fix the issues, Monocarp can\ninvite an arbitrary number of participants to each division. Note that\nMonocarp can't kick out any of the \n    n\n participants who have already\nregistered for the tournament. However, he wants to invite as little extra\nparticipants as possible. Help Monocarp to choose \n    x\n and \n    y\n in such\na way that the total amount of extra participants required is as small as\npossible. Output that amount. Input The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. The first line\nof each testcase contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of the registered participants. The second line\nof each testcase contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the weights of the registered participants. The sum of\n\n    n\n over all testcases doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach testcase, print a single integer \u2014 the smallest number of extra\nparticipants Monocarp is required to invite after he chooses the weight\nboundaries \n    x\n and \n    y\n. Example Input 4 4 3 1 2 1 1 1 6 2 2 2 1 1 1 8\n6 3 6 3 6 3 6 6 Output 0 2 3 2 Note In the first testcase of the example,\nMonocarp can choose \n    x=2\n and \n    y=3\n. Lightweight, middleweight and\nheavyweight divisions will have \n    2\n, \n    1\n and \n    1\n participants,\nrespectively. They all are powers of two, so no extra participants are\nrequired. In the second testcase of the example, regardless of the choice of\n\n    x\n and \n    y\n, one division will have \n    1\n participant, the rest will\nhave \n    0\n. Thus, Monocarp will have to invite \n    1\n participant into both\nof the remaining divisions. In the third testcase of the example, Monocarp can\nchoose \n    x=1\n and \n    y=2\n. Lightweight, middleweight and heavyweight\ndivisions will have \n    0\n, \n    3\n and \n    3\n participants, respectively.\nSo an extra participant is needed in each division. In the fourth testcase of\nthe example, Monocarp can choose \n    x=8\n and \n    y=9\n. Lightweight,\nmiddleweight and heavyweight divisions will have \n    8\n, \n    0\n and \n    0\n\nparticipants, respectively. Middleweight and heavyweight division need an\nextra participant each.\n\n",
