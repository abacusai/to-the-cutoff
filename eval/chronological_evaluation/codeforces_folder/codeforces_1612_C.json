        "description": "You are a usual chat user on the most famous streaming platform. Of course,\nthere are some moments when you just want to chill and spam something. More\nprecisely, you want to spam the emote triangle of size \n    k\n. It consists of\n\n    2k-1\n messages. The first message consists of one emote, the second one \u2014\nof two emotes, ..., the \n    k\n-th one \u2014 of \n    k\n emotes, the \n    k+1\n-th\none \u2014 of \n    k-1\n emotes, ..., and the last one \u2014 of one emote. For example,\nthe emote triangle for \n    k=3\n consists of \n    5\n messages: Of course, most\nof the channels have auto moderation. Auto moderator of the current chat will\nban you right after you spam at least \n    x\n emotes in succession (you can\nassume you are the only user in the chat). Now you are interested \u2014 how many\nmessages will you write before getting banned? Or maybe you will not get\nbanned at all (i.e. will write all \n    2k-1\n messages and complete your emote\ntriangle successfully)? Note that if you get banned as a result of writing a\nmessage, this message is also counted. You have to answer \n    t\n independent\ntest cases. Input The first line of the input contains one integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next \n    t\n\nlines describe test cases. The only line of the test case contains integers\n\n    k\n and \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^9; 1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^18\n).\nOutput For each test case, print the number of messages you will write before\ngetting banned for the corresponding values \n    k\n and \n    x\n. Example Input\n7 4 6 4 7 1 2 3 7 2 5 100 1 1000000000 923456789987654321 Output 3 4 1 4 3 1\n1608737403 Note Let's analyze the test cases of the example. In the first test\ncase, you write three messages containing \n    1\n, \n    2\n and \n    3\n emotes\nrespectively, and since \n    1 + 2 + 3 \n    \u2265 6\n, you get banned after that. In\nthe second test case, you write four messages containing \n    1\n, \n    2\n,\n\n    3\n and \n    4\n emotes respectively, and since \n    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 \n    \u2265\n    7\n, you get banned after that. In the third test case, you write one message\ncontaining exactly \n    1\n emote. It doesn't get you banned, since \n    1 <\n    2\n, but you have already finished posting your emote triangle. So you wrote\none message successfully. In the fourth test case, you write four messages\ncontaining \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    3\n and \n    2\n emotes respectively, and\nsince \n    1 + 2 + 3 + 2 \n    \u2265 7\n, you get banned after that. In the fifth\ntest case, you write three messages containing \n    1\n, \n    2\n and \n    1\n\nemote respectively. It doesn't get you banned, since \n    1 + 2 + 1 < 5\n, but\nyou have already finished posting your emote triangle. So you wrote three\nmessages successfully. In the sixth test case, since \n    x = 1\n, you get\nbanned as soon as you send your first message. The seventh test case is too\nlarge to analyze, so we'll skip it.\n\n",
