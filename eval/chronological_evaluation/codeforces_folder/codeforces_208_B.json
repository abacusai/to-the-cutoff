        "description": "A boy named Vasya wants to play an old Russian solitaire called \"Accordion\".\nIn this solitaire, the player must observe the following rules: A deck of n\ncards is carefully shuffled, then all n cards are put on the table in a line\nfrom left to right; Before each move the table has several piles of cards\nlying in a line (initially there are n piles, each pile has one card). Let's\nnumber the piles from left to right, from 1 to x. During one move, a player\ncan take the whole pile with the maximum number x (that is the rightmost of\nremaining) and put it on the top of pile x - 1 (if it exists) or on the top of\npile x - 3 (if it exists). The player can put one pile on top of another one\nonly if the piles' top cards have the same suits or values. Please note that\nif pile x goes on top of pile y, then the top card of pile x becomes the top\ncard of the resulting pile. Also note that each move decreases the total\nnumber of piles by 1; The solitaire is considered completed if all cards are\nin the same pile. Vasya has already shuffled the cards and put them on the\ntable, help him understand whether completing this solitaire is possible or\nnot. Input The first input line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 52) \u2014 the\nnumber of cards in Vasya's deck. The next line contains n space-separated\nstrings c1, c2, ..., cn, where string ci describes the i-th card on the table.\nEach string ci consists of exactly two characters, the first one represents\nthe card's value, the second one represents its suit. Cards on the table are\nnumbered from left to right. A card's value is specified by one of these\ncharacters: \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\", \"T\", \"J\", \"Q\", \"K\", \"A\". A\ncard's suit is specified by one of these characters: \"S\", \"D\", \"H\", \"C\". It is\nnot guaranteed that the deck has all possible cards. Also, the cards in\nVasya's deck can repeat. Output On a single line print the answer to the\nproblem: string \"YES\" (without the quotes) if completing the solitaire is\npossible, string \"NO\" (without the quotes) otherwise. Examples Input 4 2S 2S\n2C 2C Output YES Input 2 3S 2C Output NO Note In the first sample you can act\nlike that: put the 4-th pile on the 1-st one; put the 3-rd pile on the 2-nd\none; put the 2-nd pile on the 1-st one. In the second sample there is no way\nto complete the solitaire.\n\n",
