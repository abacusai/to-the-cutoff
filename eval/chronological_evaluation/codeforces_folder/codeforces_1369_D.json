        "description": "Lee tried so hard to make a good div.2 D problem to balance his recent\ncontest, but it still doesn't feel good at all. Lee invented it so tediously\nslow that he managed to develop a phobia about div.2 D problem setting\ninstead. And now he is hiding behind the bushes... Let's define a Rooted Dead\nBush (RDB) of level \n    n\n as a rooted tree constructed as described below. A\nrooted dead bush of level \n    1\n is a single vertex. To construct an RDB of\nlevel \n    i\n we, at first, construct an RDB of level \n    i-1\n, then for each\nvertex \n    u\n: if \n    u\n has no children then we will add a single child to\nit; if \n    u\n has one child then we will add two children to it; if \n    u\n\nhas more than one child, then we will skip it. Rooted Dead Bushes of level\n\n    1\n, \n    2\n and \n    3\n. Let's define a claw as a rooted tree with four\nvertices: one root vertex (called also as center) with three children. It\nlooks like a claw: The center of the claw is the vertex with label \n    1\n.\nLee has a Rooted Dead Bush of level \n    n\n. Initially, all vertices of his\nRDB are green. In one move, he can choose a claw in his RDB, if all vertices\nin the claw are green and all vertices of the claw are children of its center,\nthen he colors the claw's vertices in yellow. He'd like to know the maximum\nnumber of yellow vertices he can achieve. Since the answer might be very\nlarge, print it modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Next \n    t\n\nlines contain test cases \u2014 one per line. The first line of each test case\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^6\n) \u2014 the\nlevel of Lee's RDB. Output For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the\nmaximum number of yellow vertices Lee can make modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Example\nInput 7 1 2 3 4 5 100 2000000 Output 0 0 4 4 12 990998587 804665184 Note It's\neasy to see that the answer for RDB of level \n    1\n or \n    2\n is \n    0\n.\nThe answer for RDB of level \n    3\n is \n    4\n since there is only one claw we\ncan choose: \n    1, 2, 3, 4\n. The answer for RDB of level \n    4\n is\n\n    4\n since we can choose either single claw \n    1, 3, 2, 4\n or\nsingle claw \n    2, 7, 5, 6\n. There are no other claws in the RDB of\nlevel \n    4\n (for example, we can't choose \n    2, 1, 7, 6\n, since\n\n    1\n is not a child of center vertex \n    2\n).
