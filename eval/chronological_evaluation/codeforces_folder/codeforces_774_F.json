        "description": "Stepan has n pens. Every day he uses them, and on the i-th day he uses the pen\nnumber i. On the (n + 1)-th day again he uses the pen number 1, on the (n +\n2)-th \u2014 he uses the pen number 2 and so on. On every working day (from Monday\nto Saturday, inclusive) Stepan spends exactly 1 milliliter of ink of the pen\nhe uses that day. On Sunday Stepan has a day of rest, he does not stend the\nink of the pen he uses that day. Stepan knows the current volume of ink in\neach of his pens. Now it's the Monday morning and Stepan is going to use the\npen number 1 today. Your task is to determine which pen will run out of ink\nbefore all the rest (that is, there will be no ink left in it), if Stepan will\nuse the pens according to the conditions described above. Input The first line\ncontains the integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50 000) \u2014 the number of pens Stepan has. The\nsecond line contains the sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9),\nwhere ai is equal to the number of milliliters of ink which the pen number i\ncurrently has. Output Print the index of the pen which will run out of ink\nbefore all (it means that there will be no ink left in it), if Stepan will use\npens according to the conditions described above. Pens are numbered in the\norder they are given in input data. The numeration begins from one. Note that\nthe answer is always unambiguous, since several pens can not end at the same\ntime. Examples Input 3 3 3 3 Output 2 Input 5 5 4 5 4 4 Output 5 Note In the\nfirst test Stepan uses ink of pens as follows: on the day number 1 (Monday)\nStepan will use the pen number 1, after that there will be 2 milliliters of\nink in it; on the day number 2 (Tuesday) Stepan will use the pen number 2,\nafter that there will be 2 milliliters of ink in it; on the day number 3\n(Wednesday) Stepan will use the pen number 3, after that there will be 2\nmilliliters of ink in it; on the day number 4 (Thursday) Stepan will use the\npen number 1, after that there will be 1 milliliters of ink in it; on the day\nnumber 5 (Friday) Stepan will use the pen number 2, after that there will be 1\nmilliliters of ink in it; on the day number 6 (Saturday) Stepan will use the\npen number 3, after that there will be 1 milliliters of ink in it; on the day\nnumber 7 (Sunday) Stepan will use the pen number 1, but it is a day of rest so\nhe will not waste ink of this pen in it; on the day number 8 (Monday) Stepan\nwill use the pen number 2, after that this pen will run out of ink. So, the\nfirst pen which will not have ink is the pen number 2.\n\n",
