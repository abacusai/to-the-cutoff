        "description": "Scientists say a lot about the problems of global warming and cooling of the\nEarth. Indeed, such natural phenomena strongly influence all life on our\nplanet. Our hero Vasya is quite concerned about the problems. He decided to\ntry a little experiment and observe how outside daily temperature changes. He\nhung out a thermometer on the balcony every morning and recorded the\ntemperature. He had been measuring the temperature for the last n days. Thus,\nhe got a sequence of numbers t1, t2, ..., tn, where the i-th number is the\ntemperature on the i-th day. Vasya analyzed the temperature statistics in\nother cities, and came to the conclusion that the city has no environmental\nproblems, if first the temperature outside is negative for some non-zero\nnumber of days, and then the temperature is positive for some non-zero number\nof days. More formally, there must be a positive integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 1)\nsuch that t1 < 0, t2 < 0, ..., tk < 0 and tk + 1 > 0, tk + 2 > 0, ..., tn > 0.\nIn particular, the temperature should never be zero. If this condition is not\nmet, Vasya decides that his city has environmental problems, and gets upset.\nYou do not want to upset Vasya. Therefore, you want to select multiple values\nof temperature and modify them to satisfy Vasya's condition. You need to know\nwhat the least number of temperature values needs to be changed for that.\nInput The first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number\nof days for which Vasya has been measuring the temperature. The second line\ncontains a sequence of n integers t1, t2, ..., tn (|ti| \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the sequence\nof temperature values. Numbers ti are separated by single spaces. Output Print\na single integer \u2014 the answer to the given task. Examples Input 4 -1 1 -2 1\nOutput 1 Input 5 0 -1 1 2 -5 Output 2 Note Note to the first sample: there are\ntwo ways to change exactly one number so that the sequence met Vasya's\ncondition. You can either replace the first number 1 by any negative number or\nreplace the number -2 by any positive number.\n\n",
