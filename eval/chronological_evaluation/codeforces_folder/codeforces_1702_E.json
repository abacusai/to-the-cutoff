        "description": "Polycarp was recently given a set of \n    n\n (number \n    n\n \u2014 even) dominoes.\nEach domino contains two integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Can he divide all\nthe dominoes into two sets so that all the numbers on the dominoes of each set\nare different? Each domino must go into exactly one of the two sets. For\nexample, if he has \n    4\n dominoes: \n    1, 4\n, \n    1,\n    3\n, \n    3, 2\n and \n    4, 2\n, then Polycarp will\nbe able to divide them into two sets in the required way. The first set can\ninclude the first and third dominoes (\n    1, 4\n and \n    3,\n    2\n), and the second set \u2014 the second and fourth ones (\n    1,\n    3\n and \n    4, 2\n). Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case\ncontains a single even integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n)\n\u2014 the number of dominoes. The next \n    n\n lines contain pairs of numbers\n\n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264 n\n) describing the\nnumbers on the \n    i\n-th domino. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n\nover all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test\ncase print: YES, if it is possible to divide \n    n\n dominoes into two sets so\nthat the numbers on the dominoes of each set are different; NO if this is not\npossible. You can print YES and NO in any case (for example, the strings yEs,\nyes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive answer). Example Input 6 4 1\n2 4 3 2 1 3 4 6 1 2 4 5 1 3 4 6 2 3 5 6 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 1 8 2 1 1 2 4 3 4 3\n5 6 5 7 8 6 7 8 8 1 2 2 1 4 3 5 3 5 4 6 7 8 6 7 8 Output YES NO NO YES YES NO\nNote In the first test case, the dominoes can be divided as follows: First set\nof dominoes: \n    [\n    \n    1, 2\n    \n    , \n    \n    4, 3\n    \n    ]\n Second set of dominoes:\n\n    [\n    \n    2, 1\n    \n    , \n    \n    3, 4\n    \n    ]\n In other words, in the first set we\ntake dominoes with numbers \n    1\n and \n    2\n, and in the second set we take\ndominoes with numbers \n    3\n and \n    4\n.In the second test case, there's no\nway to divide dominoes into \n    2\n sets, at least one of them will contain\nrepeated number.\n\n",
