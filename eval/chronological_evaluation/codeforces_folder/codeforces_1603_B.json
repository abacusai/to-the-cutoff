Help him to find an\ninteger \n    n\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^18\n and \n    n\n    \n     x = y \n     n\n. Here, \n    a \n     b\n denotes the remainder of\n\n    a\n after division by \n    b\n. If there are multiple such integers, output\nany. It can be shown that such an integer always exists under the given\nconstraints. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first and only line of\neach test case contains two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 x, y\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n, both are even). Output For each test case, print a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^18\n) that satisfies the\ncondition mentioned in the statement. If there are multiple such integers,\noutput any. It can be shown that such an integer always exists under the given\nconstraints. Example Input 4 4 8 4 2 420 420 69420 42068 Output 4 10 420\n9969128 Note In the first test case, \n    4 \n     4 = 8 \n     4 = 0\n. In\nthe second test case, \n    10 \n     4 = 2 \n     10 = 2\n.
