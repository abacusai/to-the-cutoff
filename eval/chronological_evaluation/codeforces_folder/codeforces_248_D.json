        "name": "Sweets for Everyone!",
        "description": "For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath, Was busy now, hanging a\nmistletoe wreath. \"And they're hanging their stockings!\" he snarled with a\nsneer, \"Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here!\" Dr. Suess, How The\nGrinch Stole Christmas Christmas celebrations are coming to Whoville. Cindy\nLou Who and her parents Lou Lou Who and Betty Lou Who decided to give sweets\nto all people in their street. They decided to give the residents of each\nhouse on the street, one kilogram of sweets. So they need as many kilos of\nsweets as there are homes on their street. The street, where the Lou Who\nfamily lives can be represented as n consecutive sections of equal length. You\ncan go from any section to a neighbouring one in one unit of time. Each of the\nsections is one of three types: an empty piece of land, a house or a shop.\nCindy Lou and her family can buy sweets in a shop, but no more than one\nkilogram of sweets in one shop (the vendors care about the residents of\nWhoville not to overeat on sweets). After the Lou Who family leave their home,\nthey will be on the first section of the road. To get to this section of the\nroad, they also require one unit of time. We can assume that Cindy and her mom\nand dad can carry an unlimited number of kilograms of sweets. Every time they\nare on a house section, they can give a kilogram of sweets to the inhabitants\nof the house, or they can simply move to another section. If the family have\nalready given sweets to the residents of a house, they can't do it again.\nSimilarly, if they are on the shop section, they can either buy a kilo of\nsweets in it or skip this shop. If they've bought a kilo of sweets in a shop,\nthe seller of the shop remembered them and the won't sell them a single candy\nif they come again. The time to buy and give sweets can be neglected. The Lou\nWhos do not want the people of any house to remain without food. The Lou Whos\nwant to spend no more than t time units of time to give out sweets, as they\nreally want to have enough time to prepare for the Christmas celebration. In\norder to have time to give all the sweets, they may have to initially bring\nadditional k kilos of sweets. Cindy Lou wants to know the minimum number of k\nkilos of sweets they need to take with them, to have time to give sweets to\nthe residents of each house in their street. Your task is to write a program\nthat will determine the minimum possible value of k. Input The first line of\nthe input contains two space-separated integers n and t (2 \u2264 n \u2264 5\u00b710^5, 1 \u2264 t\n\u2264 10^9). The second line of the input contains n characters, the i-th of them\nequals \"H\" (if the i-th segment contains a house), \"S\" (if the i-th segment\ncontains a shop) or \".\" (if the i-th segment doesn't contain a house or a\nshop). It is guaranteed that there is at least one segment with a house.\nOutput If there isn't a single value of k that makes it possible to give\nsweets to everybody in at most t units of time, print in a single line \"-1\"\n(without the quotes). Otherwise, print on a single line the minimum possible\nvalue of k. Examples Input 6 6 HSHSHS Output 1 Input 14 100 ...HHHSSS...SH\nOutput 0 Input 23 50 HHSS.......SSHHHHHHHHHH Output 8 Note In the first\nexample, there are as many stores, as houses. If the family do not take a\nsingle kilo of sweets from home, in order to treat the inhabitants of the\nfirst house, they will need to make at least one step back, and they have\nabsolutely no time for it. If they take one kilogram of sweets, they won't\nneed to go back. In the second example, the number of shops is equal to the\nnumber of houses and plenty of time. Available at all stores passing out candy\nin one direction and give them when passing in the opposite direction. In the\nthird example, the shops on the street are fewer than houses. The Lou Whos\nhave to take the missing number of kilograms of sweets with them from home.\n\n",
