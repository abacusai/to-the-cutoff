        "description": "Once upon a time there was only one router in the well-known company Bmail.\nYears went by and over time new routers were purchased. Every time they bought\na new router, they connected it to one of the routers bought before it. You\nare given the values \n    p_i\n \u2014 the index of the router to which the\n\n    i\n-th router was connected after being purchased (\n    p_i < i\n). There\nare \n    n\n routers in Boogle in total now. Print the sequence of routers on\nthe path from the first to the \n    n\n-th router. Input The first line\ncontains integer number \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 200000\n) \u2014 the number of\nthe routers. The following line contains \n    n-1\n integers \n    p_2, p_3,\n    \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i < i\n), where \n    p_i\n is equal to index of\nthe router to which the \n    i\n-th was connected after purchase. Output Print\nthe path from the \n    1\n-st to the \n    n\n-th router. It starts with \n    1\n\nand ends with \n    n\n. All the elements in the path should be distinct.\nExamples Input 8 1 1 2 2 3 2 5 Output 1 2 5 8 Input 6 1 2 3 4 5 Output 1 2 3 4\n5 6 Input 7 1 1 2 3 4 3 Output 1 3 7\n\n",
