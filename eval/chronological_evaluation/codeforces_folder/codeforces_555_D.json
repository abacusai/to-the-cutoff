        "description": "Andrewid the Android is a galaxy-famous detective. Now he is busy with a top\nsecret case, the details of which are not subject to disclosure. However, he\nneeds help conducting one of the investigative experiment. There are n pegs\nput on a plane, they are numbered from 1 to n, the coordinates of the i-th of\nthem are (xi, 0). Then, we tie to the bottom of one of the pegs a weight on a\ntight rope of length l (thus, its coordinates will be equal to (xi, - l),\nwhere i is the number of the used peg). Then the weight is pushed to the\nright, so that it starts to rotate counterclockwise. At the same time, if the\nweight during rotation touches some of the other pegs, it then begins to\nrotate around that peg. Suppose that each peg itself is very thin and does not\naffect the rope length while weight is rotating around it. More formally, if\nat some moment the segment of the rope contains one or more pegs in addition\nto the peg around which the weight is rotating, the weight will then rotate\naround the farthermost one of them on a shorter segment of a rope. In\nparticular, if the segment of the rope touches some peg by its endpoint, it is\nconsidered that the weight starts to rotate around that peg on a segment of\nthe rope of length 0. At some moment the weight will begin to rotate around\nsome peg, without affecting the rest of the pegs. Andrewid interested in\ndetermining the number of this peg. Andrewid prepared m queries containing\ninitial conditions for pushing the weight, help him to determine for each of\nthem, around what peg the weight will eventually rotate. Input The first line\ncontains integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of pegs and\nqueries. The next line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn ( - 10^9 \u2264 xi \u2264\n10^9) \u2014 the coordinates of the pegs. It is guaranteed that the coordinates of\nall the pegs are distinct integers. Next m lines contain the descriptions of\nthe queries of pushing the weight, each consists of two integers ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264\nn) and li (1 \u2264 li \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of the starting peg and the length of\nthe rope. Output Print m lines, the i-th line should contain the number of the\npeg around which the weight will eventually rotate after the i-th push.\nExamples Input 3 2 0 3 5 2 3 1 8 Output 3 2 Input 4 4 1 5 7 15 1 4 2 15 3 16 1\n28 Output 2 4 3 1 Note Picture to the first sample test: Picture to the second\nsample test: Note that in the last query weight starts to rotate around the\npeg 1 attached to a rope segment of length 0.\n\n",
