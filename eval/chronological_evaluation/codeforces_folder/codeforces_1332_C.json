        "description": "Word \n    s\n of length \n    n\n is called \n    k\n-complete if \n    s\n is a\npalindrome, i.e. \n    s_i=s_n+1-i\n for all \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    s\n\nhas a period of \n    k\n, i.e. \n    s_i=s_k+i\n for all \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    n-k\n. For example, \"abaaba\" is a \n    3\n-complete word, while \"abccba\" is\nnot. Bob is given a word \n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting of only\nlowercase Latin letters and an integer \n    k\n, such that \n    n\n is divisible\nby \n    k\n. He wants to convert \n    s\n to any \n    k\n-complete word. To do\nthis Bob can choose some \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) and replace the\nletter at position \n    i\n with some other lowercase Latin letter. So now Bob\nwants to know the minimum number of letters he has to replace to convert\n\n    s\n to any \n    k\n-complete word. Note that Bob can do zero changes if the\nword \n    s\n is already \n    k\n-complete. You are required to answer \n    t\n\ntest cases independently. Input The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line\nof each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k < n\n    \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    n\n is divisible by \n    k\n). The second line of\neach test case contains a word \n    s\n of length \n    n\n. It is guaranteed\nthat word \n    s\n only contains lowercase Latin letters. And it is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases will not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output one integer, representing the\nminimum number of characters he has to replace to convert \n    s\n to any\n\n    k\n-complete word. Example Input 4 6 2 abaaba 6 3 abaaba 36 9\nhippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia 21 7 wudixiaoxingxingheclp Output 2 0 23\n16 Note In the first test case, one optimal solution is aaaaaa. In the second\ntest case, the given word itself is \n    k\n-complete.\n\n",
