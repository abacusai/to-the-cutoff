        "description": "A known chef has prepared \n    n\n dishes: the \n    i\n-th dish consists of\n\n    a_i\n grams of fish and \n    b_i\n grams of meat. The banquet organizers\nestimate the balance of \n    n\n dishes as follows. The balance is equal to the\nabsolute value of the difference between the total mass of fish and the total\nmass of meat. Technically, the balance equals to\n\n    |\n    \u2211\n    _i=1^n a_i - \n    \u2211\n    _i=1^n\n    b_i\n    |\n. The smaller the balance, the better. In order to improve the\nbalance, a taster was invited. He will eat exactly \n    m\n grams of food from\neach dish. For each dish, the taster determines separately how much fish and\nhow much meat he will eat. The only condition is that he should eat exactly\n\n    m\n grams of each dish in total. Determine how much of what type of food\nthe taster should eat from each dish so that the value of the balance is as\nminimal as possible. If there are several correct answers, you may choose any\nof them. Input The first line of input data contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of the test cases. Each test case's\ndescription is preceded by a blank line. Next comes a line that contains\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    0\n    \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^6\n). The next \n    n\n lines describe dishes, the\n\n    i\n-th of them contains a pair of integers \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the masses of fish and meat in the \n    i\n-th\ndish. It is guaranteed that it is possible to eat \n    m\n grams of food from\neach dish. In other words, \n    m \n    \u2264 a_i+b_i\n for all \n    i\n from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n inclusive. The sum of all \n    n\n values over all test cases in the\ntest does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print on\nthe first line the minimal balance value that can be achieved by eating\nexactly \n    m\n grams of food from each dish. Then print \n    n\n lines that\ndescribe a way to do this: the \n    i\n-th line should contain two integers\n\n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 a_i\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264 y_i \n    \u2264\n    b_i\n; \n    x_i+y_i=m\n), where \n    x_i\n is how many grams of fish taster\nshould eat from the \n    i\n-th meal and \n    y_i\n is how many grams of meat.\nIf there are several ways to achieve a minimal balance, find any of them.\nExample Input 8 1 5 3 4 1 6 3 4 2 2 1 3 4 2 2 4 1 3 1 7 3 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 3 6 1\n8 1 9 30 10 3 4 3 1 3 2 4 1 5 4 0 7 6 4 0 8 4 1 5 3 Output 0 2 3 1 3 3 0 1 1 1\n1 2 1 3 0 4 3 0 6 0 6 0 6 7 1 5 1 5 6 0 0 3 1 3 1 3 1 0 0 4 2 2 0 4 3 1 1 3\n\n",
