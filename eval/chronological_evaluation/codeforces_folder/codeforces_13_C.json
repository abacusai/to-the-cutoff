        "description": "Little Petya likes to play very much. And most of all he likes to play the\nfollowing game: He is given a sequence of N integer numbers. At each step it\nis allowed to increase the value of any number by 1 or to decrease it by 1.\nThe goal of the game is to make the sequence non-decreasing with the smallest\nnumber of steps. Petya is not good at math, so he asks for your help. The\nsequence a is called non-decreasing if a1 \u2264 a2 \u2264 ... \u2264 aN holds, where N is\nthe length of the sequence. Input The first line of the input contains single\ninteger N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 5000) \u2014 the length of the initial sequence. The following N\nlines contain one integer each \u2014 elements of the sequence. These numbers do\nnot exceed 10^9 by absolute value. Output Output one integer \u2014 minimum number\nof steps required to achieve the goal. Examples Input 5 3 2 -1 2 11 Output 4\nInput 5 2 1 1 1 1 Output 1\n\n",
