        "description": "You are beta testing the new secret Terraria update. This update will add\nquests to the game! Simply, the world map can be represented as an array of\nlength \n    n\n, where the \n    i\n-th column of the world has height \n    a_i\n.\nThere are \n    m\n quests you have to test. The \n    j\n-th of them is\nrepresented by two integers \n    s_j\n and \n    t_j\n. In this quest, you have\nto go from the column \n    s_j\n to the column \n    t_j\n. At the start of the\nquest, you are appearing at the column \n    s_j\n. In one move, you can go from\nthe column \n    x\n to the column \n    x-1\n or to the column \n    x+1\n. In this\nversion, you have Spectre Boots, which allow you to fly. Since it is a beta\nversion, they are bugged, so they only allow you to fly when you are going up\nand have infinite fly duration. When you are moving from the column with the\nheight \n    p\n to the column with the height \n    q\n, then you get some amount\nof fall damage. If the height \n    p\n is greater than the height \n    q\n, you\nget \n    p - q\n fall damage, otherwise you fly up and get \n    0\n damage. For\neach of the given quests, determine the minimum amount of fall damage you can\nget during this quest. Input The first line of the input contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5; 1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of columns in the world and the number of quests you have to test,\nrespectively. The second line of the input contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), where \n    a_i\n is the\nheight of the \n    i\n-th column of the world. The next \n    m\n lines describe\nquests. The \n    j\n-th of them contains two integers \n    s_j\n and \n    t_j\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 s_j, t_j \n    \u2264 n; s_j \n     t_j\n), which means you have to move\nfrom the column \n    s_j\n to the column \n    t_j\n during the \n    j\n-th quest.\nNote that \n    s_j\n can be greater than \n    t_j\n. Output Print \n    m\n\nintegers. The \n    j\n-th of them should be the minimum amount of fall damage\nyou can get during the \n    j\n-th quest completion.
