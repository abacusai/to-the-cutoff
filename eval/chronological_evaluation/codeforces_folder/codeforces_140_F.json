        "description": "As Gerald ..., in other words, on a New Year Eve Constantine prepared an\nunusual present for the Beautiful Lady. The present is the magic New Year\nsnowflake that can make any dream come true. The New Year snowflake consists\nof tiny ice crystals, which can be approximately regarded as points on the\nplane. The beauty of the New Year snowflake is that it has a center of\nsymmetry. This is a point such that for each crystal of the snowflake exists\nanother crystal, symmetrical to it relative to that point. One of the crystals\ncan be placed directly in the center of symmetry. While Constantine was\nchoosing a snowflake among millions of other snowflakes, no less symmetrical\nand no less magical, then endured a difficult path through the drifts to the\nhouse of his mistress, while he was waiting with bated breath for a few long\nmoments before the Beautiful Lady opens the door, some of the snowflake\ncrystals melted and naturally disappeared. Constantine is sure that there were\nno more than k of such crystals, because he handled the snowflake very\ncarefully. Now he is ready to demonstrate to the Beautiful Lady all the power\nof nanotechnology and restore the symmetry of snowflakes. You are given the\ncoordinates of the surviving snowflake crystals, given in nanometers. Your\ntask is to identify all possible positions of the original center of symmetry.\nInput The first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, 0 \u2264 k \u2264\n10) \u2014 the number of the surviving snowflake crystals and the maximum number of\nmelted crystals, correspondingly. Next n lines contain the coordinates of the\ncrystals that are left in the following form: \"xi yi\". The coordinates are\nintegers and do not exceed 5\u00b710^8 in absolute value. All given points are\ndifferent. Output The first line contains an integer c \u2014 the number of\npossible symmetry centers. Next c lines should contain the centers'\ndescriptions. Each symmetry center is described by a couple of coordinates \"x\ny\", separated by a space. Print the coordinates with absolute error not\nexceeding 10^-6. You are allowed to print the symmetry centers in any order.\nAll printed points should be different. If there exist an infinite number of\npossible symmetry centers, print the single number \"-1\". Examples Input 4 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1 1 Output 1 0.5 0.5 Input 4 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 Output 5 0.0 0.5 0.5\n0.0 0.5 0.5 0.5 1.0 1.0 0.5 Input 4 4 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 Output -1\n\n",
