        "description": "After a long time living abroad, you have decided to move back to Italy and\nhave to find a place to live, but things are not so easy due to the ongoing\nglobal pandemic. Your three friends Fabio, Flavio and Francesco live at the\npoints with coordinates \n    (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)\n and \n    (x_3, y_3)\n,\nrespectively. Due to the mobility restrictions in response to the pandemic,\nmeetings are limited to \n    3\n persons, so you will only be able to meet\n\n    2\n of your friends at a time. Moreover, in order to contain the spread of\nthe infection, the authorities have imposed the following additional measure:\nfor each meeting, the sum of the lengths travelled by each of the attendees\nfrom their residence place to the place of the meeting must not exceed\n\n    r\n. What is the minimum value of \n    r\n (which can be any nonnegative\nreal number) for which there exists a place of residence that allows you to\nhold the three possible meetings involving you and two of your friends? Note\nthat the chosen place of residence need not have integer coordinates. Input\nThe first line contains the two integers \n    x_1, y_1\n (\n    -10^4 \n    \u2264 x_1,\n    y_1 \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the coordinates of the house of your friend Fabio. The\nsecond line contains the two integers \n    x_2, y_2\n (\n    -10^4 \n    \u2264 x_2, y_2\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the coordinates of the house of your friend Flavio. The third\nline contains the two integers \n    x_3, y_3\n (\n    -10^4 \n    \u2264 x_3, y_3 \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the coordinates of the house of your friend Francesco. It is\nguaranteed that your three friends live in different places (i.e., the three\npoints \n    (x_1, y_1)\n, \n    (x_2, y_2)\n, \n    (x_3, y_3)\n are guaranteed to\nbe distinct). Output Print the minimum value of \n    r\n which allows you to\nfind a residence place satisfying the above conditions. Your answer is\nconsidered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed\n\n    10^-4\n. Formally, let your answer be \n    a\n, and the jury's answer be\n\n    b\n. Your answer is accepted if and only if \n    |a - b|/\n    max(1,\n    |b|)\n    \u2264 10^-4\n. Examples Input 0 0 5 0 3 3 Output 5.0686143166 Input\n-1 0 0 0 1 0 Output 2.0000000000 Note In the first sample, Fabio, Flavio and\nFrancesco live at the points with coordinates \n    (0,0)\n, \n    (5,0)\n and\n\n    (3,3)\n respectively. The optimal place of residence, represented by a\ngreen house in the picture below, is at the point with coordinates\n\n    (2.3842..., 0.4151...)\n. For instance, it is possible for you to meet\nFlavio and Francesco at the point depicted below, so that the sum of the\nlengths travelled by the three attendees is at most (and in fact equal to)\n\n    r=5.0686...\n. In the second sample, any point on the segment\n\n    (x,0):\n     -1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 1\n is an optimal place of\nresidence.\n\n",
