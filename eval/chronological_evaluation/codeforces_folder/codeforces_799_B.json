        "description": "A new pack of n t-shirts came to a shop. Each of the t-shirts is characterized\nby three integers pi, ai and bi, where pi is the price of the i-th t-shirt, ai\nis front color of the i-th t-shirt and bi is back color of the i-th t-shirt.\nAll values pi are distinct, and values ai and bi are integers from 1 to 3. m\nbuyers will come to the shop. Each of them wants to buy exactly one t-shirt.\nFor the j-th buyer we know his favorite color cj. A buyer agrees to buy a\nt-shirt, if at least one side (front or back) is painted in his favorite\ncolor. Among all t-shirts that have colors acceptable to this buyer he will\nchoose the cheapest one. If there are no such t-shirts, the buyer won't buy\nanything. Assume that the buyers come one by one, and each buyer is served\nonly after the previous one is served. You are to compute the prices each\nbuyer will pay for t-shirts. Input The first line contains single integer n (1\n\u2264 n \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number of t-shirts. The following line contains sequence\nof integers p1, p2, ..., pn (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 1 000 000 000), where pi equals to the\nprice of the i-th t-shirt. The following line contains sequence of integers\na1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 3), where ai equals to the front color of the i-th\nt-shirt. The following line contains sequence of integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 \u2264\nbi \u2264 3), where bi equals to the back color of the i-th t-shirt. The next line\ncontains single integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number of buyers. The\nfollowing line contains sequence c1, c2, ..., cm (1 \u2264 cj \u2264 3), where cj equals\nto the favorite color of the j-th buyer. The buyers will come to the shop in\nthe order they are given in the input. Each buyer is served only after the\nprevious one is served. Output Print to the first line m integers \u2014 the j-th\ninteger should be equal to the price of the t-shirt which the j-th buyer will\nbuy. If the j-th buyer won't buy anything, print -1.
