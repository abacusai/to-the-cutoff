        "name": "Fake bullions",
        "description": "In Isart people don't die. There are n gangs of criminals. The i-th gang\ncontains si evil people numerated from 0 to si - 1. Some of these people took\npart in a big mine robbery and picked one gold bullion each (these people are\ngiven in the input). That happened 10^100 years ago and then all of the gangs\nescaped to a remote area, far from towns. During the years, they were copying\nsome gold bullions according to an organized plan in order to not get\narrested. They constructed a tournament directed graph (a graph where there is\nexactly one directed edge between every pair of vertices) of gangs (the graph\nis given in the input). In this graph an edge from u to v means that in the\ni-th hour the person of the gang u can send a fake gold bullion to person of\ngang v. He sends it if he has some bullion (real or fake), while the receiver\ndoesn't have any. Thus, at any moment each of the gangsters has zero or one\ngold bullion. Some of them have real bullions, and some of them have fake\nones. In the beginning of this year, the police has finally found the gangs,\nbut they couldn't catch them, as usual. The police decided to open a jewelry\nstore so that the gangsters would sell the bullions. Thus, every gangster that\nhas a bullion (fake or real) will try to sell it. If he has a real gold\nbullion, he sells it without problems, but if he has a fake one, there is a\nchoice of two events that can happen: The person sells the gold bullion\nsuccessfully. The person is arrested by police. The power of a gang is the\nnumber of people in it that successfully sold their bullion. After all selling\nis done, the police arrests b gangs out of top gangs. Sort the gangs by\npowers, we call the first a gang top gangs(you can sort the equal powers in\neach order). Consider all possible results of selling fake gold bullions and\nall possible choice of b gangs among the top gangs. Count the number of\ndifferent sets of these b gangs modulo 10^9 + 7. Two sets X and Y are\nconsidered different if some gang is in X and isn't in Y. Input The first line\ncontains four integers n, a and b (1 \u2264 b \u2264 a \u2264 n \u2264 5\u00b710^3) \u2014 the number of\ngangs, the constants a and b from the statement. Then n lines follow, each\nline contains a string of size n consisting of zeros and ones. The j-th\ncharacter in the i-th of these lines is equal to 1, then the vertex i have a\ndirected edge to the vertex j. It is guaranteed that aii = 0 and aij + aji = 1\nif i \u2260 j. Then n lines follow, each line starts with the integer si (1 \u2264 si \u2264\n2\u00b710^6) \u2014 the number of gangsters in the i-th gang, and then contains a string\nof zeros and ones with length si. The j-th character is 0 if the j-th person\nof the i-th gang had a real gold bullion initially, otherwise it is 1. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of si does not exceed 2\u00b710^6. Output Print single\ninteger: the number of different sets of b gangs the police can arrest modulo\n10^9 + 7.
