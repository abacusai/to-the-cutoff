        "description": "Consider an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n with elements numbered from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n. It is possible to remove the \n    i\n-th element of \n    a\n\nif \n    gcd(a_i, i) = 1\n, where \n    gcd\n denotes the greatest common divisor.\nAfter an element is removed, the elements to the right are shifted to the left\nby one position. An array \n    b\n with \n    n\n integers such that \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    b_i \n    \u2264 n - i + 1\n is a removal sequence for the array \n    a\n if it is\npossible to remove all elements of \n    a\n, if you remove the \n    b_1\n-th\nelement, then the \n    b_2\n-th, ..., then the \n    b_n\n-th element. For\nexample, let \n    a = [42, 314]\n: \n    [1, 1]\n is a removal sequence: when you\nremove the \n    1\n-st element of the array, the condition \n    gcd(42, 1) = 1\n\nholds, and the array becomes \n    [314]\n; when you remove the \n    1\n-st\nelement again, the condition \n    gcd(314, 1) = 1\n holds, and the array\nbecomes empty. \n    [2, 1]\n is not a removal sequence: when you try to remove\nthe \n    2\n-nd element, the condition \n    gcd(314, 2) = 1\n is false. An array\nis ambiguous if it has at least two removal sequences. For example, the array\n\n    [1, 2, 5]\n is ambiguous: it has removal sequences \n    [3, 1, 1]\n and\n\n    [1, 2, 1]\n. The array \n    [42, 314]\n is not ambiguous: the only removal\nsequence it has is \n    [1, 1]\n. You are given two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n. You have to calculate the number of ambiguous arrays \n    a\n such\nthat the length of \n    a\n is from \n    1\n to \n    n\n and each \n    a_i\n is an\ninteger from \n    1\n to \n    m\n. Input The only line of the input contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    m \n    \u2264 10^12\n). Output Print one integer \u2014 the number of ambiguous arrays\n\n    a\n such that the length of \n    a\n is from \n    1\n to \n    n\n and each\n\n    a_i\n is an integer from \n    1\n to \n    m\n. Since the answer can be very\nlarge, print it modulo \n    998244353\n. Examples Input 2 3 Output 6 Input 4 2\nOutput 26 Input 4 6 Output 1494 Input 1337 424242424242 Output 119112628\n\n",
