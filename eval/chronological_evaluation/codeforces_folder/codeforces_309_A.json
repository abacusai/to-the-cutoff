        "description": "People like to be fit. That's why many of them are ready to wake up at dawn,\ngo to the stadium and run. In this problem your task is to help a company\ndesign a new stadium. The city of N has a shabby old stadium. Many people like\nit and every morning thousands of people come out to this stadium to run. The\nstadium can be represented as a circle, its length is exactly l meters with a\nmarked start line. However, there can't be simultaneous start in the morning,\nso exactly at 7, each runner goes to his favorite spot on the stadium and\nstarts running from there. Note that not everybody runs in the same manner as\neverybody else. Some people run in the clockwise direction, some of them run\nin the counter-clockwise direction. It mostly depends on the runner's mood in\nthe morning, so you can assume that each running direction is equiprobable for\neach runner in any fixed morning. The stadium is tiny and is in need of major\nrepair, for right now there only is one running track! You can't get too\nplayful on a single track, that's why all runners keep the same running speed\n\u2014 exactly 1 meter per a time unit. Nevertheless, the runners that choose\ndifferent directions bump into each other as they meet. The company wants to\ndesign a new stadium, but they first need to know how bad the old one is. For\nthat they need the expectation of the number of bumpings by t time units after\nthe running has begun. Help the company count the required expectation. Note\nthat each runner chooses a direction equiprobably, independently from the\nothers and then all runners start running simultaneously at 7 a.m. Assume that\neach runner runs for t time units without stopping. Consider the runners to\nbump at a certain moment if at that moment they found themselves at the same\npoint in the stadium. A pair of runners can bump more than once. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains three integers n, l, t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6, 1 \u2264 l \u2264\n10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9). The next line contains n distinct integers a1, a2, ...,\nan (0 \u2264 a1 < a2 < ... < an < l), here ai is the clockwise distance from the\nstart line to the i-th runner's starting position. Output Print a single real\nnumber \u2014 the answer to the problem with absolute or relative error of at most\n10^-6. Examples Input 2 5 1 0 2 Output 0.2500000000 Input 3 7 3 0 1 6 Output\n1.5000000000 Note There are two runners in the first example. If the first\nrunner run clockwise direction, then in 1 time unit he will be 1m away from\nthe start line. If the second runner run counter-clockwise direction then in 1\ntime unit he will be also 1m away from the start line. And it is the only\npossible way to meet. We assume that each running direction is equiprobable,\nso the answer for the example is equal to 0.5\u00b70.5 = 0.25.\n\n",
