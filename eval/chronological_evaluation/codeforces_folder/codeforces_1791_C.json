        "description": "Timur initially had a binary string\n    ^\n    \u2020\n \n    s\n (possibly of\nlength \n    0\n). He performed the following operation several (possibly zero)\ntimes: Add \n    \n to one end of the string and \n    \n\nto the other end of the string. For example, starting from the string\n\n    \n, you can obtain either\n\n    \n or\n\n    \n.\nYou are given Timur's final string. What is the length of the shortest\npossible string he could have started with?\n    ^\n    \u2020\n A binary string\nis a string (possibly the empty string) whose characters are either\n\n    \n or \n    \n. Input The first line of the input\ncontains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of\ntestcases. The first line of each test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2000\n) \u2014 the length of Timur's final string. The second line\nof each test case contains a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting of\ncharacters \n    \n or \n    \n, denoting the final\nstring. Output For each test case, output a single nonnegative integer \u2014 the\nshortest possible length of Timur's original string. Note that Timur's\noriginal string could have been empty, in which case you should output\n\n    0\n. Example Input 9 3 100 4 0111 5 10101 6 101010 7 1010110 1 1 2 10 2 11\n10 1011011010 Output 1 2 5 0 3 1 0 2 4 Note In the first test case, the\nshortest possible string Timur started with is \n    \n, and he\nperformed the following operation: \n    \u2192\n. In the\nsecond test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is\n\n    \n, and he performed the following operation:\n\n    \u2192\n. In the\nthird test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is\n\n    \n, and he didn't perform any operations. In the fourth\ntest case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is the empty string\n(which we denote by \n    \u03b5\n), and he performed the following\noperations: \n    \u03b5\n    \u2192\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u2192\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u2192\n. In\nthe fifth test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is\n\n    \n, and he performed the following operations:\n\n    \u2192\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u2192\n.\n\n",
