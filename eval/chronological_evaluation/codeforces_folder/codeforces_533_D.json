        "description": "We have an old building with n + 2 columns in a row. These columns support the\nceiling. These columns are located in points with coordinates 0 = x0 < x1 <\n... < xn < xn + 1. The leftmost and the rightmost columns are special, we will\ncall them bearing, the other columns are ordinary. For each column we know its\ndurability di. Let's consider an ordinary column with coordinate x. Let's\nassume that the coordinate of the closest to it column to the left (bearing or\nordinary) is a and the coordinate of the closest to it column to the right\n(also, bearing or ordinary) is b. In this task let's assume that this column\nsupports the segment of the ceiling from point to point (here both fractions\nare considered as real division). If the length of the segment of the ceiling\nsupported by the column exceeds di, then the column cannot support it and it\ncrashes after a while, and after that the load is being redistributeed between\nthe neighbouring columns according to the same principle. Thus, ordinary\ncolumns will be crashing for some time until the process stops at some state.\nOne can prove that the set of the remaining columns doesn't depend on the\norder in which columns crash. If there are only two bearing columns left in\nthe end, then we assume that the whole construction crashes under the weight\nof the roof. But if at least one ordinary column stays in addition to the\nbearing ones, then the building doesn't crash. To make the building stronger,\nwe can add one extra ordinary column of arbitrary durability d' at any (not\nnecessarily integer) point 0 < x' < xn + 1. If point x' is already occupied by\nan ordinary column, it is replaced by a new one. Your task is to find out:\nwhat minimal durability can the added column have so that the building doesn't\ncrash? Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of\nordinary columns. The second line contains n + 2 integers x0, x1, ..., xn, xn\n+ 1 (x0 = 0, xi < xi + 1 for 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, xn + 1 \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the coordinates of\nthe columns. The third line contains n integers d1, d2, ..., dn (1 \u2264 di \u2264\n10^9). Output Print a single number \u2014 the minimum possible durability of the\ncolumn that you need to add in order to make the building stay. If you do not\nhave to add the column, please print 0. Your answer will be checked with the\nrelative or absolute error 10^-4. Examples Input 2 0 20 40 100 15 40 Output 10\nInput 3 0 4 10 28 30 9 13 5 Output 0\n\n",
