        "name": "Tanya and Stairways",
        "description": "Little girl Tanya climbs the stairs inside a multi-storey building. Every time\nTanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from \n    1\n to the number\nof steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud. For example, if she\nclimbs two stairways, the first of which contains \n    3\n steps, and the\nsecond contains \n    4\n steps, she will pronounce the numbers \n    1, 2, 3, 1,\n    2, 3, 4\n. You are given all the numbers pronounced by Tanya. How many\nstairways did she climb? Also, output the number of steps in each stairway.\nThe given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced\nwhen climbing one or more stairways. Input The first line contains \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the total number of numbers pronounced by\nTanya. The second line contains integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 all the numbers Tanya pronounced while climbing the\nstairs, in order from the first to the last pronounced number. Passing a\nstairway with \n    x\n steps, she will pronounce the numbers \n    1, 2, \n    \u2026,\n    x\n in that order. The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya\ncould have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways. Output In the first\nline, output \n    t\n \u2014 the number of stairways that Tanya climbed. In the\nsecond line, output \n    t\n numbers \u2014 the number of steps in each stairway she\nclimbed. Write the numbers in the correct order of passage of the stairways.\nExamples Input 7 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 Output 2 3 4 Input 4 1 1 1 1 Output 4 1 1 1 1\nInput 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 1 5 Input 5 1 2 1 2 1 Output 3 2 2 1\n\n",
