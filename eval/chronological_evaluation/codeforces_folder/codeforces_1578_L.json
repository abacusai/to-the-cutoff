        "description": "In a dream, Lucy found herself in a labyrinth. This labyrinth consists of\n\n    n\n rooms, connected by \n    m\n passages (\n    i\n-th passage is \n    w_i\n\ncm wide). Each passage can be traversed in both directions. It is guaranteed\nthat it is possible to get from any room to any other room. But this is not an\nordinary labyrinth \u2014 each room in this labyrinth contains a magic candy. When\nLucy eats this magic candy, she is getting wider. Specifically, if she eats\ncandy from room \n    i\n she becomes wider by \n    c_i\n cm. Note that she is\nnot obliged to eat candy the first time she visits a particular room, but she\ncan eat each candy only once. Unfortunately, passages in this labyrinth are\npretty narrow, so after eating some candy, Lucy can get too wide and will not\nbe able to traverse them \u2014 her width should not be greater than the width of\nthe corresponding passage. Lucy starts her journey in a room number \n    1\n.\nShe wants to eat all the candies. After that, she will just wake up, so she\ndoes not have to be able to return to the room \n    1\n. She realizes that with\nher current width, she may not be able to do so, so she plans a workout before\nembarking on her journey. Lucy wants to know if it is possible to start with\nsome positive width and still eat all the candies. If yes, then what is the\nmaximal starting width with which it is possible. Input The first line\ncontains two integers, \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5; n - 1\n    \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of rooms and the number of passages. The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \u2014 \n    c_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n). Next \n    m\n lines contain three integers each \u2014 \n    a_i\n,\n\n    b_i\n and \n    w_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264 n; a_i \n     b_i; 1 \n    \u2264\n    w_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) describing passage that connects rooms \n    a_i\n and\n\n    b_i\n and is \n    w_i\n cm wide. It is guaranteed that the resulting\nlabyrinth is connected and there is at most one passage between any pair of\nrooms. Output If it is possible to eat all the candies, output the maximal\npossible starting width, otherwise output \n    -1\n.
