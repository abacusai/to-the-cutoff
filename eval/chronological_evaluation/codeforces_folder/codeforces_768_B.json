        "description": "Jon fought bravely to rescue the wildlings who were attacked by the white-\nwalkers at Hardhome. On his arrival, Sam tells him that he wants to go to\nOldtown to train at the Citadel to become a maester, so he can return and take\nthe deceased Aemon's place as maester of Castle Black. Jon agrees to Sam's\nproposal and Sam sets off his journey to the Citadel. However becoming a\ntrainee at the Citadel is not a cakewalk and hence the maesters at the Citadel\ngave Sam a problem to test his eligibility. Initially Sam has a list with a\nsingle element n. Then he has to perform certain operations on this list. In\neach operation Sam must remove any element x, such that x > 1, from the list\nand insert at the same position , , sequentially. He must continue with these\noperations until all the elements in the list are either 0 or 1. Now the\nmasters want the total number of 1s in the range l to r (1-indexed). Sam wants\nto become a maester but unfortunately he cannot solve this problem. Can you\nhelp Sam to pass the eligibility test? Input The first line contains three\nintegers n, l, r (0 \u2264 n < 2^50, 0 \u2264 r - l \u2264 10^5, r \u2265 1, l \u2265 1) \u2013 initial\nelement and the range l to r. It is guaranteed that r is not greater than the\nlength of the final list. Output Output the total number of 1s in the range l\nto r in the final sequence. Examples Input 7 2 5 Output 4 Input 10 3 10 Output\n5 Note Consider first example: Elements on positions from 2-nd to 5-th in list\nis [1, 1, 1, 1]. The number of ones is 4. For the second example: Elements on\npositions from 3-rd to 10-th in list is [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]. The number\nof ones is 5.\n\n",
