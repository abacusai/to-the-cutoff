        "description": "It is Bubble Cup finals season and farmer Johnny Bubbles must harvest his\nbubbles. The bubbles are in a rectangular bubblefield formed of \n    N\n x\n\n    M\n square parcels divided into \n    N\n rows and \n    M\n columns. The\nparcel in \n    i^th\n row and \n    j^th\n column yields \n    A_i,j\n\nbubbles. Johnny Bubbles has available a very special self-driving bubble\nharvester that, once manually positioned at the beginning of a row or column,\nautomatically harvests all the bubbles in that row or column. Once the\nharvester reaches the end of the row or column it stops and must be\nrepositioned. The harvester can pass through any parcel any number of times,\nbut it can collect bubbles from the parcel only once. Johnny is very busy\nfarmer, so he is available to manually position the harvester at most four\ntimes per day. Johnny is also impatient, so he wants to harvest as many\nbubbles as possible on the first day. Please help Johnny to calculate what is\nthe maximum number of bubbles he can collect on the first day. Input The first\nline contains two integers \n    N\n and \n    M\n (\n    1\n \n    \u2264\n \n    N\n,\n\n    M\n \n    \u2264\n \n    N\n * \n    M\n \n    \u2264\n \n    10^5\n) - the\nbubblefield size. Each of the next \n    N\n lines contains \n    M\n integers.\nThe \n    j^th\n element in the \n    i^th\n line is \n    A_i,j\n (\n    0\n\n\n    \u2264\n \n    a_i,j\n \n    \u2264\n \n    10^9\n) \u2014 the yield of the\nparcel located in the \n    i^th\n row and the \n    j^th\n column. Output\nOutput contains one integer number - maximum number of the bubbles Johnny can\nharvest on the first day. Examples Input 2 2 1 2 3 4 Output 10 Input 5 5 0 9 2\n7 0 9 0 3 0 5 0 8 0 3 1 6 7 4 3 9 3 6 4 1 0 Output 80 Note In the first\nexample, farmer Johnny can harvest all the bubbles by positioning the\nharvester on the first and the second row. In the second example, one way\nJohnny can harvest maximum number of bubbles is to position the harvester in\nthe second row, the fourth row, the second column and the fourth column.\n\n",
