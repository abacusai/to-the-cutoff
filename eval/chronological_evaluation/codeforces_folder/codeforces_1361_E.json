        "description": "James Bond has a new plan for catching his enemy. There are some cities and\ndirected roads between them, such that it is possible to travel between any\ntwo cities using these roads. When the enemy appears in some city, Bond knows\nher next destination but has no idea which path she will choose to move there.\nThe city \n    a\n is called interesting, if for each city \n    b\n, there is\nexactly one simple path from \n    a\n to \n    b\n. By a simple path, we\nunderstand a sequence of distinct cities, such that for every two neighboring\ncities, there exists a directed road from the first to the second city. Bond's\nenemy is the mistress of escapes, so only the chase started in an interesting\ncity gives the possibility of catching her. James wants to arrange his people\nin such cities. However, if there are not enough interesting cities, the whole\naction doesn't make sense since Bond's people may wait too long for the enemy.\nYou are responsible for finding all the interesting cities or saying that\nthere is not enough of them. By not enough, James means strictly less than\n\n    20\n    %\n of all cities. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case\nis described as follows: The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of cities and roads between them. Each of the following \n    m\n\nlines contains two integers \n    u\n, \n    v\n (\n    u \n    \u2260 v\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 u,\n    v \n    \u2264 n\n), which denote that there is a directed road from \n    u\n to\n\n    v\n. You can assume that between each ordered pair of cities there is at\nmost one road. The sum of \n    n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed\n\n    10^5\n, and the sum of \n    m\n doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output\nIf strictly less than \n    20\n    %\n of all cities are interesting, print\n\n    -1\n. Otherwise, let \n    k\n be the number of interesting cities. Print\n\n    k\n distinct integers in increasing order \u2014 the indices of interesting\ncities.

In the first sample, each city is\ninteresting. In the second sample, no city is interesting. In the third\nsample, cities \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    3\n and \n    5\n are interesting. In the\nlast sample, only the city \n    1\n is interesting. It is strictly less than\n\n    20\n    %\n of all cities, so the answer is \n    -1\n.\n\n",
