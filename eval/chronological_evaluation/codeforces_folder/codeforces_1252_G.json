        "description": "Randall is a software engineer at a company with \n    N\n employees. Every\nyear, the company re-evaluates its employees. At the end of every year, the\ncompany replaces its several worst-performing employees and replaces with the\nsame number of new employees, so that the company keeps having \n    N\n\nemployees. Each person has a constant performance and can be represented by an\ninteger (higher integer means better performance), and no two people have the\nsame performance. The performance of the initial employees are represented by\nan array of integers \n    A = [A_1, A_2, \n    \u2026, A_N]\n where \n    A_i\n is the\nperformance of the \n    i^th\n employee. Randall is employee \n    1\n, so his\nperformance is \n    A_1\n. We will consider the first \n    M\n years. At the end\nof the \n    i^th\n year, the company replaces its \n    R_i\n worst-performing\nemployees and replaces with \n    R_i\n new employees. The performance of these\nnew employees are represented by an array of integers \n    B_i = [(B_i)_1,\n    (B_i)_2, \n    \u2026, (B_i)_R_i]\n where \n    (B_i)_j\n is the performance of\nthe \n    j^th\n new employee. He will consider \n    Q\n scenarios. On the\n\n    i^th\n scenario, he will change the value of \n    (B_X_i)_Y_i\n to\n\n    Z_i\n. For each scenario, Randall is wondering whether he will still be in\nthe company after \n    M\n years. Note that the changes in each scenario are\nkept for the subsequent scenarios. Input Input begins with a line containing\nthree integers: \n    N\n \n    M\n \n    Q\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n;\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 M, Q \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) representing the number of employees, the\nnumber of years to be considered, and the number of scenarios, respectively.\nThe next line contains \n    N\n integers: \n    A_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 A_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) representing the performance of the initial employees. The next\n\n    M\n lines each contains several integers: \n    R_i\n \n    (B_i)_1\n,\n\n    (B_i)_2\n, \n    \u22ef\n, \n    (B_i)_R_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 R_i < N\n; \n    0\n    \n    \u2264 (B_i)_j \n    \u2264 10^9\n) representing the number of employees replaced and\nthe performance of the new employees, respectively. It is guaranteed that the\nsum of \n    R_i\n does not exceed \n    10^6\n. The next \n    Q\n lines each\ncontains three integers: \n    X_i\n \n    Y_i\n \n    Z_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 X_i \n    \u2264\n    M\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 Y_i \n    \u2264 R_(X_i)\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264 Z_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n)\nrepresenting a scenario. It is guaranteed that all integers in all \n    A_i\n,\n\n    (B_i)_j\n, and \n    Z_i\n (combined together) are distinct. Output For each\nscenario in the same order as input, output in a line an integer \n    0\n if\nRandall will not be in the company after \n    M\n years, or \n    1\n if Randall\nwill still be in the company after \n    M\n years. Example Input 5 3 3 50 40 30\n20 10 4 1 2 3 100 1 4 2 6 7 1 3 300 2 1 400 2 1 5 Output 1 0 1 Note\nExplanation for the sample input/output #1 Randall performance is represented\nby \n    50\n. For the first scenario, the value of \n    (B_1)_3\n is updated to\n\n    300\n, causes the following: Initially, the performance of the employees\nis \n    [50, 40, 30, 20, 10]\n. At the end of the first year, \n    4\n worst-\nperforming employees are replaced by employees with performance \n    [300, 100,\n    2, 1]\n. Therefore, the performance of the employees is \n    [300, 100, 50, 2,\n    1]\n. At the end of the second year, the performance of the employees is\n\n    [300, 100, 50, 4, 2]\n. At the end of the third year, the performance of\nthe employees is \n    [300, 100, 50, 7, 6]\n. Therefore, Randall will still be\nin the company after \n    3\n years.For the second scenario, the value of\n\n    (B_2)_1\n is updated to \n    400\n, causes the following: Initially, the\nperformance of the employees is \n    [50, 40, 30, 20, 10]\n. At the end of the\nfirst year, the performance of the employees is \n    [300, 100, 50, 2, 1]\n.\nRecall that the change in the first scenario is kept for this scenario as\nwell. At the end of the second year, the performance of the employees is\n\n    [400, 300, 100, 50, 2]\n. At the end of the third year, the performance of\nthe employees is \n    [400, 300, 100, 7, 6]\n. Therefore, Randall will not be\nin the company after \n    3\n years.\n\n",
