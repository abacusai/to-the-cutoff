        "description": "Vasya had an array of \n    n\n integers, each element of the array was from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n. He chose \n    m\n pairs of different positions and wrote\nthem down to a sheet of paper. Then Vasya compared the elements at these\npositions, and wrote down the results of the comparisons to another sheet of\npaper. For each pair he wrote either \"greater\", \"less\", or \"equal\". After\nseveral years, he has found the first sheet of paper, but he couldn't find the\nsecond one. Also he doesn't remember the array he had. In particular, he\ndoesn't remember if the array had equal elements. He has told this sad story\nto his informatics teacher Dr Helen. She told him that it could be the case\nthat even if Vasya finds his second sheet, he would still not be able to find\nout whether the array had two equal elements. Now Vasya wants to find two\narrays of integers, each of length \n    n\n. All elements of the first array\nmust be distinct, and there must be two equal elements in the second array.\nFor each pair of positions Vasya wrote at the first sheet of paper, the result\nof the comparison must be the same for the corresponding elements of the first\narray, and the corresponding elements of the second array. Help Vasya find two\nsuch arrays of length \n    n\n, or find out that there are no such arrays for\nhis sets of pairs. Input The first line of input contains two integers\n\n    n\n, \n    m\n \u2014 the number of elements in the array and number of\ncomparisons made by Vasya (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 m\n    \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n). Each of the following \n    m\n lines contains two\nintegers \n    a_i\n, \n    b_i\n \u2014 the positions of the \n    i\n-th comparison\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    a_i \n     b_i\n). It's guaranteed that\nany unordered pair is given in the input at most once. Output The first line\nof output must contain \"YES\" if there exist two arrays, such that the results\nof comparisons would be the same, and all numbers in the first one are\ndistinct, and the second one contains two equal numbers. Otherwise it must\ncontain \"NO\". If the arrays exist, the second line must contain the array of\ndistinct integers, the third line must contain the array, that contains at\nleast one pair of equal elements. Elements of the arrays must be integers from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n. Examples Input 1 0 Output NO Input 3 1 1 2 Output YES 1 3\n2 1 3 1 Input 4 3 1 2 1 3 2 4 Output YES 1 3 4 2 1 3 4 1\n\n",
