        "name": "George and Interesting Graph",
        "description": "George loves graphs. Most of all, he loves interesting graphs. We will assume\nthat a directed graph is interesting, if it meets the following criteria: The\ngraph doesn't contain any multiple arcs; There is vertex v (we'll call her the\ncenter), such that for any vertex of graph u, the graph contains arcs (u, v)\nand (v, u). Please note that the graph also contains loop (v, v). The\noutdegree of all vertexes except for the center equals two and the indegree of\nall vertexes except for the center equals two. The outdegree of vertex u is\nthe number of arcs that go out of u, the indegree of vertex u is the number of\narcs that go in u. Please note that the graph can contain loops. However, not\neverything's that simple. George got a directed graph of n vertices and m arcs\nas a present. The graph didn't have any multiple arcs. As George loves\ninteresting graphs, he wants to slightly alter the presented graph and\ntransform it into an interesting one. In one alteration he can either remove\nan arbitrary existing arc from the graph or add an arbitrary arc to the graph.\nGeorge wonders: what is the minimum number of changes that he needs to obtain\nan interesting graph from the graph he's got as a present? Help George and\nfind the answer to the question. Input The first line contains two space-\nseparated integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 500, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of\nvertices and arcs in the presented graph. Each of the next m lines contains\ntwo space-separated integers ai, bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 n) \u2014 the descriptions of the\ngraph's arcs. Pair (ai, bi) means that the graph contains an arc from vertex\nnumber ai to vertex number bi. It is guaranteed that the presented graph\ndoesn't contain multiple arcs. Assume that the grah vertices are numbered 1\nthrough n. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the answer to George's question.\nExamples Input 3 7 1 1 2 2 3 1 1 3 3 2 2 3 3 3 Output 0 Input 3 6 1 1 2 2 3 1\n3 2 2 3 3 3 Output 1 Input 3 1 2 2 Output 6 Note For more information about\ndirected graphs, please visit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph In\nthe first sample the graph already is interesting, its center is vertex 3.\n\n",
