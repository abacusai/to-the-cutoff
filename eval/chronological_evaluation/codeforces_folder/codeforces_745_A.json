        "description": "Hongcow is learning to spell! One day, his teacher gives him a word that he\nneeds to learn to spell. Being a dutiful student, he immediately learns how to\nspell the word. Hongcow has decided to try to make new words from this one. He\nstarts by taking the word he just learned how to spell, and moves the last\ncharacter of the word to the beginning of the word. He calls this a cyclic\nshift. He can apply cyclic shift many times. For example, consecutively\napplying cyclic shift operation to the word \"abracadabra\" Hongcow will get\nwords \"aabracadabr\", \"raabracadab\" and so on. Hongcow is now wondering how\nmany distinct words he can generate by doing the cyclic shift arbitrarily many\ntimes. The initial string is also counted. Input The first line of input will\nbe a single string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 50), the word Hongcow initially learns how to\nspell. The string s consists only of lowercase English letters ('a'\u2013'z').\nOutput Output a single integer equal to the number of distinct strings that\nHongcow can obtain by applying the cyclic shift arbitrarily many times to the\ngiven string. Examples Input abcd Output 4 Input bbb Output 1 Input yzyz\nOutput 2 Note For the first sample, the strings Hongcow can generate are\n\"abcd\", \"dabc\", \"cdab\", and \"bcda\". For the second sample, no matter how many\ntimes Hongcow does the cyclic shift, Hongcow can only generate \"bbb\". For the\nthird sample, the two strings Hongcow can generate are \"yzyz\" and \"zyzy\".\n\n",
