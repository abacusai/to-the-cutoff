        "description": "Gianni, SWERC's chief judge, received a huge amount of high quality problems\nfrom the judges and now he has to choose a problem set for SWERC. He received\n\n    n\n problems and he assigned a beauty score and a difficulty to each of\nthem. The \n    i\n-th problem has beauty score equal to \n    b_i\n and\ndifficulty equal to \n    d_i\n. The beauty and the difficulty are integers\nbetween \n    1\n and \n    10\n. If there are no problems with a certain\ndifficulty (the possible difficulties are \n    1,2,\n    \u2026,10\n) then Gianni\nwill ask for more problems to the judges. Otherwise, for each difficulty\nbetween \n    1\n and \n    10\n, he will put in the problem set one of the most\nbeautiful problems with such difficulty (so the problem set will contain\nexactly \n    10\n problems with distinct difficulties). You shall compute the\ntotal beauty of the problem set, that is the sum of the beauty scores of the\nproblems chosen by Gianni. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The\nfirst line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases. The descriptions of the \n    t\n test cases follow. The first\nline of each test case contains the integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 100\n)\n\u2014 how many problems Gianni received from the judges. The next \n    n\n lines\ncontain two integers each. The \n    i\n-th of such lines contains \n    b_i\n and\n\n    d_i\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 b_i, d_i\n    \u2264 10\n) \u2014 the beauty score and the\ndifficulty of the \n    i\n-th problem. Output For each test case, print the\ntotal beauty of the problem set chosen by Gianni. If Gianni cannot create a\nproblem set (because there are no problems with a certain difficulty) print\nthe string MOREPROBLEMS (all letters are uppercase, there are no spaces).\nExample Input 2 3 8 4 9 3 6 7 12 3 10 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 3 10 10 5 10 6 10 7\n10 8 10 9 1 10 Output MOREPROBLEMS 93 Note In the first test case, Gianni has\nreceived only \n    3\n problems, with difficulties \n    3, 4, 7\n which are not\nsufficient to create a problem set (for example because there is not a problem\nwith difficulty \n    1\n). In the second test case, Gianni will create a\nproblem set by taking the problems \n    2\n, \n    3\n, \n    4\n, \n    5\n,\n\n    7\n, \n    8\n, \n    9\n, \n    10\n, \n    11\n (which have beauty equal to\n\n    10\n and all difficulties from \n    1\n to \n    9\n) and one of the problems\n\n    1\n and \n    6\n (which have both beauty \n    3\n and difficulty \n    10\n).\nThe total beauty of the resulting problem set is \n    10\n    \u00b7 9 + 3 = 93\n.\n\n",
