        "description": "Vova and Marina love offering puzzles to each other. Today Marina offered Vova\nto cope with the following task. Vova has a non-directed graph consisting of n\nvertices and m edges without loops and multiple edges. Let's define the\noperation of contraction two vertices a and b that are not connected by an\nedge. As a result of this operation vertices a and b are deleted and instead\nof them a new vertex x is added into the graph, and also edges are drawn from\nit to all vertices that were connected with a or with b (specifically, if the\nvertex was connected with both a and b, then also exactly one edge is added\nfrom x to it). Thus, as a result of contraction again a non-directed graph is\nformed, it contains no loops nor multiple edges, and it contains (n - 1)\nvertices. Vova must perform the contraction an arbitrary number of times to\ntransform the given graph into a chain of the maximum length. A chain of\nlength k (k \u2265 0) is a connected graph whose vertices can be numbered with\nintegers from 1 to k + 1 so that the edges of the graph connect all pairs of\nvertices (i, i + 1) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k) and only them. Specifically, the graph that\nconsists of one vertex is a chain of length 0. The vertices that are formed as\na result of the contraction are allowed to be used in the following operations\nof contraction. The picture illustrates the contraction of two vertices marked\nby red. Help Vova cope with his girlfriend's task. Find the maximum length of\nthe chain that can be obtained from the resulting graph or else determine that\nit is impossible to obtain the chain. Input The first line contains two\nintegers n, m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of vertices and the\nnumber of edges in the original graph. Next m lines contain the descriptions\nof edges in the format ai, bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 n, ai \u2260 bi), which means that\nthere is an edge between vertices ai and bi. It is guaranteed that there is at\nmost one edge between each pair of vertexes. Output If it is impossible to\nobtain a chain from the given graph, print - 1. Otherwise, print the maximum\npossible number of edges in the resulting chain. Examples Input 5 4 1 2 2 3 3\n4 3 5 Output 3 Input 4 6 1 2 2 3 1 3 3 4 2 4 1 4 Output -1 Input 4 2 1 3 2 4\nOutput 2 Note In the first sample test you can contract vertices 4 and 5 and\nobtain a chain of length 3. In the second sample test it is initially\nimpossible to contract any pair of vertexes, so it is impossible to achieve\nthe desired result. In the third sample test you can contract vertices 1 and 2\nand obtain a chain of length 2.\n\n",
