        "name": "PolandBall and Polygon",
        "description": "PolandBall has such a convex polygon with n veritces that no three of its\ndiagonals intersect at the same point. PolandBall decided to improve it and\ndraw some red segments. He chose a number k such that gcd(n, k) = 1. Vertices\nof the polygon are numbered from 1 to n in a clockwise way. PolandBall repeats\nthe following process n times, starting from the vertex 1: Assume you've ended\nlast operation in vertex x (consider x = 1 if it is the first operation). Draw\na new segment from vertex x to k-th next vertex in clockwise direction. This\nis a vertex x + k or x + k - n depending on which of these is a valid index of\npolygon's vertex. Your task is to calculate number of polygon's sections after\neach drawing. A section is a clear area inside the polygon bounded with drawn\ndiagonals or the polygon's sides. Input There are only two numbers in the\ninput: n and k (5 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 2, gcd(n, k) = 1). Output You should\nprint n values separated by spaces. The i-th value should represent number of\npolygon's sections after drawing first i lines. Examples Input 5 2 Output 2 3\n5 8 11 Input 10 3 Output 2 3 4 6 9 12 16 21 26 31 Note The greatest common\ndivisor (gcd) of two integers a and b is the largest positive integer that\ndivides both a and b without a remainder. For the first sample testcase, you\nshould output \"2 3 5 8 11\". Pictures below correspond to situations after\ndrawing lines.\n\n",
