        "description": "There is a string \n    s\n of lowercase English letters. A cursor is positioned\non one of the characters. The cursor can be moved with the following\noperation: choose a letter \n    c\n and a direction (left or right). The cursor\nis then moved to the closest occurence of \n    c\n in the chosen direction. If\nthere is no letter \n    c\n in that direction, the cursor stays in place. For\nexample, if \n    s = \n    \ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8b\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8b\n with the cursor on the second character\n(\n    \ud835\ude8a[\ud835\ude8b]\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8b\n), then: moving to the closest letter\n\n    \ud835\ude8a\n to the left places the cursor on the first character\n(\n    [\ud835\ude8a]\ud835\ude8b\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8b\n); moving to the closest letter \n    \ud835\ude8a\n to\nthe right places the cursor the third character (\n    \ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8b[\ud835\ude8a]\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8b\n);\nmoving to the closest letter \n    \ud835\ude8b\n to the right places the cursor\non the fifth character (\n    \ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8b\ud835\ude8a\ud835\ude8a[\ud835\ude8b]\n); any other operation leaves\nthe cursor in place.Let \n    dist(i, j)\n be the smallest number of\noperations needed to move the cursor from the \n    i\n-th character to the\n\n    j\n-th character. Compute \n    \u2211_i = 1^n \n    \u2211_j =\n    1^n \n    dist(i, j)\n. Input The only line contains a non-empty string\n\n    s\n of at most \n    10^5\n lowercase English letters. Output Print a single\ninteger \n    \u2211_i = 1^n \n    \u2211_j = 1^n\n    \n    dist(i, j)\n. Examples Input abcde Output 20 Input abacaba Output\n58 Note In the first sample case, \n    dist(i, j) = 0\n for any pair\n\n    i = j\n, and \n    1\n for all other pairs.\n\n",
