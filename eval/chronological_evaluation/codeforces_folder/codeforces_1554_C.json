Here, \n    \u2295\n is the bitwise XOR operator.\n\n    MEX\n of the sequence of non-negative integers is the\nsmallest non-negative integer that doesn't appear in this sequence. For\nexample, \n    MEX(0, 1, 2, 4) = 3\n, and\n\n    MEX(1, 2021) = 0\n. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 30\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. The first and only line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n\nand \n    m\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Output For each test case, print\na single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem. Example Input 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 69\n696 123456 654321 Output 4 3 0 640 530866 Note In the first test case, the\nsequence is \n    3 \n    \u2295 0, 3 \n    \u2295 1, 3 \n    \u2295 2, 3 \n    \u2295 3, 3\n    \n    \u2295 4, 3 \n    \u2295 5\n, or \n    3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 6\n. The smallest non-\nnegative integer which isn't present in the sequence i. e. the\n\n    MEX\n of the sequence is \n    4\n. In the second test\ncase, the sequence is \n    4 \n    \u2295 0, 4 \n    \u2295 1, 4 \n    \u2295 2, 4 \n    \u2295\n    3, 4 \n    \u2295 4, 4 \n    \u2295 5, 4 \n    \u2295 6\n, or \n    4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2\n.\nThe smallest non-negative integer which isn't present in the sequence i. e.\nthe \n    MEX\n of the sequence is \n    3\n. In the third test\ncase, the sequence is \n    3 \n    \u2295 0, 3 \n    \u2295 1, 3 \n    \u2295 2\n, or \n    3,\n    2, 1\n. The smallest non-negative integer which isn't present in the sequence\ni. e. the \n    MEX\n of the sequence is \n    0\n.\n\n",
