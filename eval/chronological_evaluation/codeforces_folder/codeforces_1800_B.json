        "description": "Kristina has a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n, consisting only of lowercase\nand uppercase Latin letters. For each pair of lowercase letter and its\nmatching uppercase letter, Kristina can get \n    1\n burl. However, pairs of\ncharacters cannot overlap, so each character can only be in one pair. For\nexample, if she has the string \n    s\n = \"aAaaBACacbE\", she can get a burl for\nthe following character pairs: \n    s_1\n = \"a\" and \n    s_2\n = \"A\" \n    s_4\n =\n\"a\" and \n    s_6\n = \"A\" \n    s_5\n = \"B\" and \n    s_10\n = \"b\" \n    s_7\n= \"C\"\nand \n    s_9\n = \"c\" Kristina wants to get more burles for her string, so she\nis going to perform no more than \n    k\n operations on it. In one operation,\nshe can: either select the lowercase character \n    s_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    n\n) and make it uppercase. or select uppercase character \n    s_i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) and make it lowercase. For example, when \n    k\n = 2 and\n\n    s\n = \"aAaaBACacbE\" it can perform one operation: choose \n    s_3\n = \"a\"\nand make it uppercase. Then she will get another pair of \n    s_3\n = \"A\" and\n\n    s_8\n = \"a\" Find maximum number of burles Kristina can get for her string.\nInput The first line of input data contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test\ncases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) and \n    k\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\nthe number of characters in the string and the maximum number of operations\nthat can be performed on it. The second line of each test case contains a\nstring \n    s\n of length \n    n\n, consisting only of lowercase and uppercase\nLatin letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print exactly\none integer on a separate line: the maximum number of burles that Kristina can\nget for her string \n    s\n. Example Input 5 11 2 aAaaBACacbE 2 2 ab 4 1 aaBB 6\n0 abBAcC 5 3 cbccb Output 5 0 1 3 2 Note The first test case is explained in\nthe problem statement. In the second test case, it is not possible to get any\npair by performing any number of operations.\n\n",
