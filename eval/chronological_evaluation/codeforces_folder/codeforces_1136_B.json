        "description": "Finished her homework, Nastya decided to play computer games. Passing levels\none by one, Nastya eventually faced a problem. Her mission is to leave a room,\nwhere a lot of monsters live, as quickly as possible. There are \n    n\n\nmanholes in the room which are situated on one line, but, unfortunately, all\nthe manholes are closed, and there is one stone on every manhole. There is\nexactly one coin under every manhole, and to win the game Nastya should pick\nall the coins. Initially Nastya stands near the \n    k\n-th manhole from the\nleft. She is thinking what to do. In one turn, Nastya can do one of the\nfollowing: if there is at least one stone on the manhole Nastya stands near,\nthrow exactly one stone from it onto any other manhole (yes, Nastya is\nstrong). go to a neighboring manhole; if there are no stones on the manhole\nNastya stays near, she can open it and pick the coin from it. After it she\nmust close the manhole immediately (it doesn't require additional moves). The\nfigure shows the intermediate state of the game. At the current position\nNastya can throw the stone to any other manhole or move left or right to the\nneighboring manholes. If she were near the leftmost manhole, she could open it\n(since there are no stones on it). Nastya can leave the room when she picks\nall the coins. Monsters are everywhere, so you need to compute the minimum\nnumber of moves Nastya has to make to pick all the coins. Note one time more\nthat Nastya can open a manhole only when there are no stones onto it. Input\nThe first and only line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n, separated\nby space (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of manholes and the index of manhole from the left, near which Nastya\nstays initially. Initially there is exactly one stone near each of the \n    n\n\nmanholes. Output Print a single integer \u2014 minimum number of moves which lead\nNastya to pick all the coins. Examples Input 2 2 Output 6 Input 4 2 Output 13\nInput 5 1 Output 15 Note Let's consider the example where \n    n = 2\n, \n    k =\n    2\n. Nastya should play as follows: At first she throws the stone from the\nsecond manhole to the first. Now there are two stones on the first manhole.\nThen she opens the second manhole and pick the coin from it. Then she goes to\nthe first manhole, throws two stones by two moves to the second manhole and\nthen opens the manhole and picks the coin from it. So, \n    6\n moves are\nrequired to win.\n\n",
