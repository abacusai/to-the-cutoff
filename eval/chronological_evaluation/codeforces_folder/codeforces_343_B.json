        "description": "Mad scientist Mike has just finished constructing a new device to search for\nextraterrestrial intelligence! He was in such a hurry to launch it for the\nfirst time that he plugged in the power wires without giving it a proper\nglance and started experimenting right away. After a while Mike observed that\nthe wires ended up entangled and now have to be untangled again. The device is\npowered by two wires \"plus\" and \"minus\". The wires run along the floor from\nthe wall (on the left) to the device (on the right). Both the wall and the\ndevice have two contacts in them on the same level, into which the wires are\nplugged in some order. The wires are considered entangled if there are one or\nmore places where one wire runs above the other one. For example, the picture\nbelow has four such places (top view): Mike knows the sequence in which the\nwires run above each other. Mike also noticed that on the left side, the\n\"plus\" wire is always plugged into the top contact (as seen on the picture).\nHe would like to untangle the wires without unplugging them and without moving\nthe device. Determine if it is possible to do that. A wire can be freely moved\nand stretched on the floor, but cannot be cut. To understand the problem\nbetter please read the notes to the test samples. Input The single line of the\ninput contains a sequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\" of length n (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n100000). The i-th (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) position of the sequence contains the character\n\"+\", if on the i-th step from the wall the \"plus\" wire runs above the \"minus\"\nwire, and the character \"-\" otherwise. Output Print either \"Yes\" (without the\nquotes) if the wires can be untangled or \"No\" (without the quotes) if the\nwires cannot be untangled. Examples Input -++- Output Yes Input +- Output No\nInput ++ Output Yes Input \u00ad Output No Note The first testcase corresponds to\nthe picture in the statement. To untangle the wires, one can first move the\n\"plus\" wire lower, thus eliminating the two crosses in the middle, and then\ndraw it under the \"minus\" wire, eliminating also the remaining two crosses. In\nthe second testcase the \"plus\" wire makes one full revolution around the\n\"minus\" wire. Thus the wires cannot be untangled: In the third testcase the\n\"plus\" wire simply runs above the \"minus\" wire twice in sequence. The wires\ncan be untangled by lifting \"plus\" and moving it higher: In the fourth\ntestcase the \"minus\" wire runs above the \"plus\" wire once. The wires cannot be\nuntangled without moving the device itself:\n\n",
