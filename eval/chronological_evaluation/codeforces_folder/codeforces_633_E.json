        "description": "An e-commerce startup pitches to the investors to get funding. They have been\nfunctional for n weeks now and also have a website! For each week they know\nthe number of unique visitors during this week vi and the revenue ci. To\nevaluate the potential of the startup at some range of weeks from l to r\ninclusive investors use the minimum among the maximum number of visitors\nmultiplied by 100 and the minimum revenue during this period, that is: The\ntruth is that investors have no idea how to efficiently evaluate the startup,\nso they are going to pick some k random distinct weeks li and give them to\nmanagers of the startup. For each li they should pick some ri \u2265 li and report\nmaximum number of visitors and minimum revenue during this period. Then,\ninvestors will calculate the potential of the startup for each of these ranges\nand take minimum value of p(li, ri) as the total evaluation grade of the\nstartup. Assuming that managers of the startup always report the optimal\nvalues of ri for some particular li, i.e., the value such that the resulting\ngrade of the startup is maximized, what is the expected resulting grade of the\nstartup? Input The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264\nk \u2264 n \u2264 1 000 000). The second line contains n integers vi (1 \u2264 vi \u2264 10^7) \u2014\nthe number of unique visitors during each week. The third line contains n\nintegers ci (1 \u2264 ci \u2264 10^7) \u2014the revenue for each week. Output Print a single\nreal value \u2014 the expected grade of the startup. Your answer will be considered\ncorrect if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^-6. Namely: let's\nassume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker\nprogram will consider your answer correct, if . Examples Input 3 2 3 2 1 300\n200 300 Output 133.3333333 Note Consider the first sample. If the investors\nask for li = 1 onwards, startup will choose ri = 1, such that max number of\nvisitors is 3 and minimum revenue is 300. Thus, potential in this case is\nmin(3\u00b7100, 300) = 300. If the investors ask for li = 2 onwards, startup will\nchoose ri = 3, such that max number of visitors is 2 and minimum revenue is\n200. Thus, potential in this case is min(2\u00b7100, 200) = 200. If the investors\nask for li = 3 onwards, startup will choose ri = 3, such that max number of\nvisitors is 1 and minimum revenue is 300. Thus, potential in this case is\nmin(1\u00b7100, 300) = 100. We have to choose a set of size 2 equi-probably and\ntake minimum of each. The possible sets here are : 200, 300,100, 300,100,\n200, effectively the set of possible values as perceived by investors equi-\nprobably: 200, 100, 100. Thus, the expected value is (100 + 200 + 100) / 3 =\n133.(3).\n\n",
