        "name": "Even Subset Sum Problem",
        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n positive integers. Find a\nnon-empty subset of its elements such that their sum is even (i.e. divisible\nby \n    2\n) or determine that there is no such subset. Both the given array\nand required subset may contain equal values. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n), number of test cases to\nsolve. Descriptions of \n    t\n test cases follow. A description of each test\ncase consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n), length of array \n    a\n. The second line\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 100\n), elements of \n    a\n. The given array \n    a\n can contain equal\nvalues (duplicates). Output For each test case output \n    -1\n if there is no\nsuch subset of elements. Otherwise output positive integer \n    k\n, number of\nelements in the required subset. Then output \n    k\n distinct integers (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n), indexes of the chosen elements. If there are multiple\nsolutions output any of them. Example Input 3 3 1 4 3 1 15 2 3 5 Output 1 2 -1\n2 1 2 Note There are three test cases in the example. In the first test case,\nyou can choose the subset consisting of only the second element. Its sum is\n\n    4\n and it is even. In the second test case, there is only one non-empty\nsubset of elements consisting of the first element, however sum in it is odd,\nso there is no solution. In the third test case, the subset consisting of all\narray's elements has even sum.\n\n",
