        "description": "There are n points marked on the plane. The points are situated in such a way\nthat they form a regular polygon (marked points are its vertices, and they are\nnumbered in counter-clockwise order). You can draw n - 1 segments, each\nconnecting any two marked points, in such a way that all points have to be\nconnected with each other (directly or indirectly). But there are some\nrestrictions. Firstly, some pairs of points cannot be connected directly and\nhave to be connected undirectly. Secondly, the segments you draw must not\nintersect in any point apart from the marked points (that is, if any two\nsegments intersect and their intersection is not a marked point, then the\npicture you have drawn is invalid). How many ways are there to connect all\nvertices with n - 1 segments? Two ways are considered different iff there\nexist some pair of points such that a segment is drawn between them in the\nfirst way of connection, but it is not drawn between these points in the\nsecond one. Since the answer might be large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7. Input\nThe first line contains one number n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 500) \u2014 the number of marked\npoints. Then n lines follow, each containing n elements. ai, j (j-th element\nof line i) is equal to 1 iff you can connect points i and j directly\n(otherwise ai, j = 0). It is guaranteed that for any pair of points ai, j =\naj, i, and for any point ai, i = 0. Output Print the number of ways to connect\npoints modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input 3 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 Output 1 Input 4 0\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 Output 12 Input 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 Output 0\n\n",
