        "description": "Recently Vasya got interested in finding extra-terrestrial intelligence. He\nmade a simple extra-terrestrial signals\u2019 receiver and was keeping a record of\nthe signals for n days in a row. Each of those n days Vasya wrote a 1 in his\nnotebook if he had received a signal that day and a 0 if he hadn\u2019t. Vasya\nthinks that he has found extra-terrestrial intelligence if there is a system\nin the way the signals has been received, i.e. if all the intervals between\nsuccessive signals are equal. Otherwise, Vasya thinks that the signals were\nsent by some stupid aliens no one cares about. Help Vasya to deduce from the\ninformation given by the receiver if he has found extra-terrestrial\nintelligence or not. Input The first line contains integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014\namount of days during which Vasya checked if there were any signals. The\nsecond line contains n characters 1 or 0 \u2014 the record Vasya kept each of those\nn days. It\u2019s guaranteed that the given record sequence contains at least three\n1s. Output If Vasya has found extra-terrestrial intelligence, output YES,\notherwise output NO. Examples Input 8 00111000 Output YES Input 7 1001011\nOutput NO Input 7 1010100 Output YES\n\n",
