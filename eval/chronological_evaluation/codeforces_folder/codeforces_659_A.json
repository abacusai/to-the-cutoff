        "description": "Vasya lives in a round building, whose entrances are numbered sequentially by\nintegers from 1 to n. Entrance n and entrance 1 are adjacent. Today Vasya got\nbored and decided to take a walk in the yard. Vasya lives in entrance a and he\ndecided that during his walk he will move around the house b entrances in the\ndirection of increasing numbers (in this order entrance n should be followed\nby entrance 1). The negative value of b corresponds to moving |b| entrances in\nthe order of decreasing numbers (in this order entrance 1 is followed by\nentrance n). If b = 0, then Vasya prefers to walk beside his entrance.\nIllustration for n = 6, a = 2, b = - 5. Help Vasya to determine the number of\nthe entrance, near which he will be at the end of his walk. Input The single\nline of the input contains three space-separated integers n, a and b (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n100, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 n, - 100 \u2264 b \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of entrances at Vasya's place,\nthe number of his entrance and the length of his walk, respectively. Output\nPrint a single integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of the entrance where Vasya\nwill be at the end of his walk. Examples Input 6 2 -5 Output 3 Input 5 1 3\nOutput 4 Input 3 2 7 Output 3 Note The first example is illustrated by the\npicture in the statements.\n\n",
