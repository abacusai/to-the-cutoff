        "description": "Just to remind, girls in Arpa's land are really nice. Mehrdad wants to invite\nsome Hoses to the palace for a dancing party. Each Hos has some weight wi and\nsome beauty bi. Also each Hos may have some friends. Hoses are divided in some\nfriendship groups. Two Hoses x and y are in the same friendship group if and\nonly if there is a sequence of Hoses a1, a2, ..., ak such that ai and ai + 1\nare friends for each 1 \u2264 i < k, and a1 = x and ak = y. Arpa allowed to use the\namphitheater of palace to Mehrdad for this party. Arpa's amphitheater can hold\nat most w weight on it. Mehrdad is so greedy that he wants to invite some\nHoses such that sum of their weights is not greater than w and sum of their\nbeauties is as large as possible. Along with that, from each friendship group\nhe can either invite all Hoses, or no more than one. Otherwise, some Hoses\nwill be hurt. Find for Mehrdad the maximum possible total beauty of Hoses he\ncan invite so that no one gets hurt and the total weight doesn't exceed w.\nInput The first line contains integers n, m and w (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, , 1 \u2264 w \u2264\n1000) \u2014 the number of Hoses, the number of pair of friends and the maximum\ntotal weight of those who are invited. The second line contains n integers w1,\nw2, ..., wn (1 \u2264 wi \u2264 1000) \u2014 the weights of the Hoses. The third line\ncontains n integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 \u2264 bi \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the beauties of the\nHoses. The next m lines contain pairs of friends, the i-th of them contains\ntwo integers xi and yi (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 n, xi \u2260 yi), meaning that Hoses xi and yi\nare friends. Note that friendship is bidirectional. All pairs (xi, yi) are\ndistinct. Output Print the maximum possible total beauty of Hoses Mehrdad can\ninvite so that no one gets hurt and the total weight doesn't exceed w.\nExamples Input 3 1 5 3 2 5 2 4 2 1 2 Output 6 Input 4 2 11 2 4 6 6 6 4 2 1 1 2\n2 3 Output 7 Note In the first sample there are two friendship groups: Hoses\n1, 2 and Hos 3. The best way is to choose all of Hoses in the first group,\nsum of their weights is equal to 5 and sum of their beauty is 6. In the second\nsample there are two friendship groups: Hoses 1, 2, 3 and Hos 4. Mehrdad\ncan't invite all the Hoses from the first group because their total weight is\n12 > 11, thus the best way is to choose the first Hos from the first group and\nthe only one from the second group. The total weight will be 8, and the total\nbeauty will be 7.\n\n",
