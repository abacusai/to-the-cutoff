        "description": "The enchanted forest got its name from the magical mushrooms growing here.\nThey may cause illusions and generally should not be approached. \u2014Perfect\nMemento in Strict Sense Marisa comes to pick mushrooms in the Enchanted\nForest. The Enchanted forest can be represented by \n    n\n points on the\n\n    X\n-axis numbered \n    1\n through \n    n\n. Before Marisa started, her\nfriend, Patchouli, used magic to detect the initial number of mushroom on each\npoint, represented by \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n. Marisa can start out at any\npoint in the forest on minute \n    0\n. Each minute, the followings happen in\norder: She moves from point \n    x\n to \n    y\n (\n    |x-y|\n    \u2264 1\n, possibly\n\n    y=x\n). She collects all mushrooms on point \n    y\n. A new mushroom\nappears on each point in the forest. Note that she cannot collect mushrooms on\nminute \n    0\n. Now, Marisa wants to know the maximum number of mushrooms she\ncan pick after \n    k\n minutes. Input Each test contains multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n,\n\n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10 ^ 5\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014\nthe number of positions with mushrooms and the time Marisa has, respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the initial number\nof mushrooms on point \n    1,2,\n    \u2026,n\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10 ^ 5\n. Output For\neach test case, print the maximum number of mushrooms Marisa can pick after\n\n    k\n minutes.

In the\nfirst minute, she moves to \n    x=1\n and collect \n    5\n mushrooms. The number\nof mushrooms will be \n    [1,7,2,3,4]\n. In the second minute, she moves to\n\n    x=2\n and collects \n    7\n mushrooms. The numbers of mushrooms will be\n\n    [2,1,3,4,5]\n. After \n    2\n minutes, Marisa collects \n    12\n mushrooms.\nIt can be shown that it is impossible to collect more than \n    12\n mushrooms.\nTest case 2: This is one of her possible moving path: \n    2 \n    \u2192 3\n    \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 1 \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 3 \n    \u2192\n    4 \n    \u2192 5\n It can be shown that it is impossible to collect more\nthan \n    37\n mushrooms.\n\n",
