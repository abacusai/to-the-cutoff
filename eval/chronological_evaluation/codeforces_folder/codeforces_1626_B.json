        "description": "You are given a decimal representation of an integer \n    x\n without leading\nzeros. You have to perform the following reduction on it exactly once: take\ntwo neighboring digits in \n    x\n and replace them with their sum without\nleading zeros (if the sum is \n    0\n, it's represented as a single \n    0\n).\nFor example, if \n    x = 10057\n, the possible reductions are: choose the first\nand the second digits \n    1\n and \n    0\n, replace them with \n    1+0=1\n; the\nresult is \n    1057\n; choose the second and the third digits \n    0\n and\n\n    0\n, replace them with \n    0+0=0\n; the result is also \n    1057\n; choose\nthe third and the fourth digits \n    0\n and \n    5\n, replace them with\n\n    0+5=5\n; the result is still \n    1057\n; choose the fourth and the fifth\ndigits \n    5\n and \n    7\n, replace them with \n    5+7=12\n; the result is\n\n    10012\n. What's the largest number that can be obtained? Input The first\nline contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of testcases. Each testcase consists of a single integer \n    x\n (\n    10\n    \n    \u2264 x < 10^200000\n). \n    x\n doesn't contain leading zeros. The total\nlength of the decimal representations of \n    x\n over all testcases doesn't\nexceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each testcase, print a single integer\n\u2014 the largest number that can be obtained after the reduction is applied\nexactly once. The number should not contain leading zeros. Example Input 2\n10057 90 Output 10012 9 Note The first testcase of the example is already\nexplained in the statement. In the second testcase, there is only one possible\nreduction: the first and the second digits.\n\n",
