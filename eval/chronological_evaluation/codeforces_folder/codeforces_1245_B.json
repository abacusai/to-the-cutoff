        "description": "Let \n    n\n be a positive integer. Let \n    a, b, c\n be nonnegative integers\nsuch that \n    a + b + c = n\n. Alice and Bob are gonna play rock-paper-\nscissors \n    n\n times. Alice knows the sequences of hands that Bob will play.\nHowever, Alice has to play rock \n    a\n times, paper \n    b\n times, and\nscissors \n    c\n times. Alice wins if she beats Bob in at least \n    \u2308\n    n/2\n    \u2309\n (\n    n/2\n rounded up to the nearest\ninteger) hands, otherwise Alice loses. Note that in rock-paper-scissors: rock\nbeats scissors; paper beats rock; scissors beat paper. The task is, given the\nsequence of hands that Bob will play, and the numbers \n    a, b, c\n, determine\nwhether or not Alice can win. And if so, find any possible sequence of hands\nthat Alice can use to win. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nInput The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then, \n    t\n testcases follow, each\nconsisting of three lines: The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n). The second line contains three integers, \n    a, b,\n    c\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a, b, c \n    \u2264 n\n). It is guaranteed that \n    a + b + c =\n    n\n. The third line contains a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n. \n    s\n is\nmade up of only 'R', 'P', and 'S'. The \n    i\n-th character is 'R' if for his\n\n    i\n-th Bob plays rock, 'P' if paper, and 'S' if scissors. Output For each\ntestcase: If Alice cannot win, print \"NO\" (without the quotes). Otherwise,\nprint \"YES\" (without the quotes). Also, print a string \n    t\n of length\n\n    n\n made up of only 'R', 'P', and 'S' \u2014 a sequence of hands that Alice can\nuse to win. \n    t\n must contain exactly \n    a\n 'R's, \n    b\n 'P's, and\n\n    c\n 'S's. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. The \"YES\" /\n\"NO\" part of the output is case-insensitive (i.e. \"yEs\", \"no\" or \"YEs\" are all\nvalid answers). Note that 'R', 'P' and 'S' are case-sensitive. Example Input 2\n3 1 1 1 RPS 3 3 0 0 RPS Output YES PSR NO Note In the first testcase, in the\nfirst hand, Alice plays paper and Bob plays rock, so Alice beats Bob. In the\nsecond hand, Alice plays scissors and Bob plays paper, so Alice beats Bob. In\nthe third hand, Alice plays rock and Bob plays scissors, so Alice beats Bob.\nAlice beat Bob 3 times, and \n    3 \n    \u2265\n    \u2308\n    3/2\n    \u2309 = 2\n,\nso Alice wins. In the second testcase, the only sequence of hands that Alice\ncan play is \"RRR\". Alice beats Bob only in the last hand, so Alice can't win.\n\n    1 < \n    \u2308\n    3/2\n    \u2309 = 2\n.\n\n",
