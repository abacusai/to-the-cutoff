        "description": "A factory produces thimbles in bulk. Typically, it can produce up to a\nthimbles a day. However, some of the machinery is defective, so it can\ncurrently only produce b thimbles each day. The factory intends to choose a\nk-day period to do maintenance and construction; it cannot produce any\nthimbles during this time, but will be restored to its full production of a\nthimbles per day after the k days are complete. Initially, no orders are\npending. The factory receives updates of the form di, ai, indicating that ai\nnew orders have been placed for the di-th day. Each order requires a single\nthimble to be produced on precisely the specified day. The factory may opt to\nfill as many or as few of the orders in a single batch as it likes. As orders\ncome in, the factory owner would like to know the maximum number of orders he\nwill be able to fill if he starts repairs on a given day pi. Help the owner\nanswer his questions. Input The first line contains five integers n, k, a, b,\nand q (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, 1 \u2264 b < a \u2264 10 000, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number\nof days, the length of the repair time, the production rates of the factory,\nand the number of updates, respectively. The next q lines contain the\ndescriptions of the queries. Each query is of one of the following two forms:\n1 di ai (1 \u2264 di \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10 000), representing an update of ai orders on\nday di, or 2 pi (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 n - k + 1), representing a question: at the moment,\nhow many orders could be filled if the factory decided to commence repairs on\nday pi? It's guaranteed that the input will contain at least one query of the\nsecond type. Output For each query of the second type, print a line containing\na single integer \u2014 the maximum number of orders that the factory can fill over\nall n days. Examples Input 5 2 2 1 8 1 1 2 1 5 3 1 2 1 2 2 1 4 2 1 3 2 2 1 2 3\nOutput 3 6 4 Input 5 4 10 1 6 1 1 5 1 5 5 1 3 2 1 5 2 2 1 2 2 Output 7 1 Note\nConsider the first sample. We produce up to 1 thimble a day currently and will\nproduce up to 2 thimbles a day after repairs. Repairs take 2 days. For the\nfirst question, we are able to fill 1 order on day 1, no orders on days 2 and\n3 since we are repairing, no orders on day 4 since no thimbles have been\nordered for that day, and 2 orders for day 5 since we are limited to our\nproduction capacity, for a total of 3 orders filled. For the third question,\nwe are able to fill 1 order on day 1, 1 order on day 2, and 2 orders on day 5,\nfor a total of 4 orders.\n\n",
