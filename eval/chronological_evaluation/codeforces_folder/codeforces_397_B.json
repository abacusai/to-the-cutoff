        "description": "Alexey, a merry Berland entrant, got sick of the gray reality and he zealously\nwants to go to university. There are a lot of universities nowadays, so Alexey\nis getting lost in the diversity \u2014 he has not yet decided what profession he\nwants to get. At school, he had bad grades in all subjects, and it's only\nthanks to wealthy parents that he was able to obtain the graduation\ncertificate. The situation is complicated by the fact that each high education\ninstitution has the determined amount of voluntary donations, paid by the new\nstudents for admission \u2014 ni berubleys. He cannot pay more than ni, because\nthen the difference between the paid amount and ni can be regarded as a bribe!\nEach rector is wearing the distinctive uniform of his university. Therefore,\nthe uniform's pockets cannot contain coins of denomination more than ri. The\nrector also does not carry coins of denomination less than li in his pocket \u2014\nbecause if everyone pays him with so small coins, they gather a lot of weight\nand the pocket tears. Therefore, a donation can be paid only by coins of\ndenomination x berubleys, where li \u2264 x \u2264 ri (Berland uses coins of any\npositive integer denomination). Alexey can use the coins of different\ndenominations and he can use the coins of the same denomination any number of\ntimes. When Alexey was first confronted with such orders, he was puzzled\nbecause it turned out that not all universities can accept him! Alexey is very\nafraid of going into the army (even though he had long wanted to get the green\nuniform, but his dad says that the army bullies will beat his son and he\ncannot pay to ensure the boy's safety). So, Alexey wants to know for sure\nwhich universities he can enter so that he could quickly choose his alma\nmater. Thanks to the parents, Alexey is not limited in money and we can assume\nthat he has an unlimited number of coins of each type. In other words, you are\ngiven t requests, each of them contains numbers ni, li, ri. For each query you\nneed to answer, whether it is possible to gather the sum of exactly ni\nberubleys using only coins with an integer denomination from li to ri\nberubleys. You can use coins of different denominations. Coins of each\ndenomination can be used any number of times. Input The first line contains\nthe number of universities t, (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) Each of the next t lines contain\nthree space-separated integers: ni, li, ri (1 \u2264 ni, li, ri \u2264 10^9; li \u2264 ri).\nOutput For each query print on a single line: either \"Yes\", if Alexey can\nenter the university, or \"No\" otherwise. Examples Input 2 5 2 3 6 4 5 Output\nYes No Note You can pay the donation to the first university with two coins:\none of denomination 2 and one of denomination 3 berubleys. The donation to the\nsecond university cannot be paid.\n\n",
