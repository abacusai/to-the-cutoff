        "description": "You have a positive integer m and a non-negative integer s. Your task is to\nfind the smallest and the largest of the numbers that have length m and sum of\ndigits s. The required numbers should be non-negative integers written in the\ndecimal base without leading zeroes. Input The single line of the input\ncontains a pair of integers m, s (1 \u2264 m \u2264 100, 0 \u2264 s \u2264 900) \u2014 the length and\nthe sum of the digits of the required numbers. Output In the output print the\npair of the required non-negative integer numbers \u2014 first the minimum possible\nnumber, then \u2014 the maximum possible number. If no numbers satisfying\nconditions required exist, print the pair of numbers \"-1 -1\" (without the\nquotes). Examples Input 2 15 Output 69 96 Input 3 0 Output -1 -1\n\n",
