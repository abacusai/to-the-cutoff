        "description": "The gardener Kazimir Kazimirovich has an array of \n    n\n integers \n    c_1,\n    c_2, \n    \u2026, c_n\n. He wants to check if there are two different\nsubsequences \n    a\n and \n    b\n of the original array, for which \n    f(a) =\n    f(b)\n, where \n    f(x)\n is the bitwise OR of all of the numbers in the\nsequence \n    x\n. A sequence \n    q\n is a subsequence of \n    p\n if \n    q\n\ncan be obtained from \n    p\n by deleting several (possibly none or all)\nelements. Two subsequences are considered different if the sets of indexes of\ntheir elements in the original sequence are different, that is, the values of\nthe elements are not considered when comparing the subsequences. Input Each\ntest contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test\ncases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the size of the array \n    c\n. The description of the\narray \n    c\n in this problem is given implicitly to speed up input. The \n    (i\n    + 1)\n-st of the following \n    n\n lines of the test case begins with an\ninteger \n    k_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k_i \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of set bits in\nthe number \n    c_i\n. Next follow \n    k_i\n distinct integers \n    p_i, 1,\n    p_i, 2, \n    \u2026, p_i, k_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014the\nnumbers of bits that are set to one in number \n    c_i\n. In other words,\n\n    c_i = 2^p_i, 1 + 2^p_i, 2 + \n    \u2026 + 2^p_i, k_i\n. It is\nguaranteed that the total sum of \n    k_i\n in all tests does not exceed\n\n    10^5\n. Output For each set of input, print \"Yes\" if there exist two\ndifferent subsequences for which \n    f(a) = f(b)\n, and \"No\" otherwise. You\ncan output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings\n\"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\nExample Input 5 3 2 1 5 2 2 4 2 2 3 2 2 1 2 1 2 4 3 1 2 4 2 2 4 4 1 2 5 6 2 2\n5 5 3 3 1 2 3 2 5 3 5 7 2 3 1 4 5 1 2 6 3 5 3 2 6 3 2 1 1 1 2 Output No Yes\nYes Yes No Note It can be proven that in the first test case there are no two\ndifferent subsequences \n    a\n and \n    b\n for which \n    f(a) = f(b)\n. In the\nsecond test case, one of the possible answers are following subsequences: the\nsubsequence \n    a\n formed by the element at position \n    1\n, and the\nsubsequence \n    b\n formed by the elements at positions \n    1\n and \n    2\n.\nIn the third test case, one of the possible answers are following\nsubsequences: the subsequence \n    a\n formed by elements at positions \n    1\n,\n\n    2\n, \n    3\n and \n    4\n, and the subsequence \n    b\n formed by elements\nat positions \n    2\n, \n    3\n and \n    4\n.\n\n",
