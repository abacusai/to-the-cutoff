        "description": "You are given a sequence of \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n. You\nare also given \n    x\n integers \n    1, 2, \n    \u2026, x\n. You are asked to\ninsert each of the extra integers into the sequence \n    a\n. Each integer can\nbe inserted at the beginning of the sequence, at the end of the sequence, or\nbetween any elements of the sequence. The score of the resulting sequence\n\n    a'\n is the sum of absolute differences of adjacent elements in it\n\n    (\n    \u2211\n    _i=1^n+x-1 |a'_i - a'_i+1|\n    )\n. What\nis the smallest possible score of the resulting sequence \n    a'\n? Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014\nthe number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, x \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of\nthe sequence and the number of extra integers. The second line of each\ntestcase contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    a_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The sum of \n    n\n over all testcases doesn't\nexceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each testcase, print a single integer\n\u2014 the smallest sum of absolute differences of adjacent elements of the\nsequence after you insert the extra integers into it.
