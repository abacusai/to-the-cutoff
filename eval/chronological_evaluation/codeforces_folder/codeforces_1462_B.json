        "description": "Polycarp has a string \n    s[1 \n    \u2026 n]\n of length \n    n\n consisting of\ndecimal digits. Polycarp performs the following operation with the string\n\n    s\n no more than once (i.e. he can perform operation \n    0\n or \n    1\n\ntime): Polycarp selects two numbers \n    i\n and \n    j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    j \n    \u2264 n\n) and removes characters from the \n    s\n string at the positions\n\n    i, i+1, i+2, \n    \u2026, j\n (i.e. removes substring \n    s[i \n    \u2026 j]\n).\nMore formally, Polycarp turns the string \n    s\n into the string \n    s_1 s_2\n    \n    \u2026 s_i-1 s_j+1 s_j+2\n    \u2026 s_n\n. For example, the string\n\n    s =\n\"20192020\" Polycarp can turn into strings: \"2020\" (in this case\n\n    (i, j)=(3, 6)\n or \n    (i, j)=(1, 4)\n); \"2019220\" (in this case \n    (i,\n    j)=(6, 6)\n); \"020\" (in this case \n    (i, j)=(1, 5)\n); other operations are\nalso possible, only a few of them are listed above. Polycarp likes the string\n\"2020\" very much, so he is wondering if it is possible to turn the string\n\n    s\n into a string \"2020\" in no more than one operation? Note that you can\nperform zero operations. Input The first line contains a positive integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 number of test cases in the test.\nThen \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    4 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 length of the string \n    s\n.\nThe next line contains a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting of\ndecimal digits. It is allowed that the string \n    s\n starts with digit 0.\nOutput For each test case, output on a separate line: \"YES\" if Polycarp can\nturn the string \n    s\n into a string \"2020\" in no more than one operation\n(i.e. he can perform \n    0\n or \n    1\n operation); \"NO\" otherwise. You may\nprint every letter of \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case you want (so, for example,\nthe strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).\nExample Input 6 8 20192020 8 22019020 4 2020 5 20002 6 729040 6 200200 Output\nYES YES YES NO NO NO Note In the first test case, Polycarp could choose\n\n    i=3\n and \n    j=6\n. In the second test case, Polycarp could choose\n\n    i=2\n and \n    j=5\n. In the third test case, Polycarp did not perform any\noperations with the string.\n\n",
