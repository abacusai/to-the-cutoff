        "name": "Vasya And The Mushrooms",
        "description": "Vasya's house is situated in a forest, and there is a mushroom glade near it.\nThe glade consists of two rows, each of which can be divided into n\nconsecutive cells. For each cell Vasya knows how fast the mushrooms grow in\nthis cell (more formally, how many grams of mushrooms grow in this cell each\nminute). Vasya spends exactly one minute to move to some adjacent cell. Vasya\ncannot leave the glade. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a\ncommon side. When Vasya enters some cell, he instantly collects all the\nmushrooms growing there. Vasya begins his journey in the left upper cell.\nEvery minute Vasya must move to some adjacent cell, he cannot wait for the\nmushrooms to grow. He wants to visit all the cells exactly once and maximize\nthe total weight of the collected mushrooms. Initially, all mushrooms have a\nweight of 0. Note that Vasya doesn't need to return to the starting cell. Help\nVasya! Calculate the maximum total weight of mushrooms he can collect. Input\nThe first line contains the number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 the length of the\nglade. The second line contains n numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^6) \u2014\nthe growth rate of mushrooms in the first row of the glade. The third line\ncontains n numbers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 \u2264 bi \u2264 10^6) is the growth rate of\nmushrooms in the second row of the glade. Output Output one number \u2014 the\nmaximum total weight of mushrooms that Vasya can collect by choosing the\noptimal route. Pay attention that Vasya must visit every cell of the glade\nexactly once. Examples Input 3 1 2 3 6 5 4 Output 70 Input 3 1 1000 10000 10\n100 100000 Output 543210 Note In the first test case, the optimal route is as\nfollows: Thus, the collected weight of mushrooms will be 0\u00b71 + 1\u00b72 + 2\u00b73 + 3\u00b74\n+ 4\u00b75 + 5\u00b76 = 70.In the second test case, the optimal route is as follows:\nThus, the collected weight of mushrooms will be 0\u00b71 + 1\u00b710 + 2\u00b7100 + 3\u00b71000 +\n4\u00b710000 + 5\u00b7100000 = 543210.\n\n",
