        "description": "Vasya is studying in the last class of school and soon he will take exams. He\ndecided to study polynomials. Polynomial is a function P(x) = a0 + a1x^1 + ...\n+ anx^n. Numbers ai are called coefficients of a polynomial, non-negative\ninteger n is called a degree of a polynomial. Vasya has made a bet with his\nfriends that he can solve any problem with polynomials. They suggested him the\nproblem: \"Determine how many polynomials P(x) exist with integer non-negative\ncoefficients so that , and , where and b are given positive integers\"? Vasya\ndoes not like losing bets, but he has no idea how to solve this task, so\nplease help him to solve the problem. Input The input contains three integer\npositive numbers no greater than 10^18. Output If there is an infinite number\nof such polynomials, then print \"inf\" without quotes, otherwise print the\nreminder of an answer modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input 2 2 2 Output 2 Input 2 3\n3 Output 1\n\n",
