        "name": "Powering the Hero (easy version)",
        "description": "This is an easy version of the problem. It differs from the hard one only by\nconstraints on \n    n\n and \n    t\n. There is a deck of \n    n\n cards, each of\nwhich is characterized by its power. There are two types of cards: a hero\ncard, the power of such a card is always equal to \n    0\n; a bonus card, the\npower of such a card is always positive. You can do the following with the\ndeck: take a card from the top of the deck; if this card is a bonus card, you\ncan put it on top of your bonus deck or discard; if this card is a hero card,\nthen the power of the top card from your bonus deck is added to his power (if\nit is not empty), after that the hero is added to your army, and the used\nbonus discards. Your task is to use such actions to gather an army with the\nmaximum possible total power. Input The first line of input data contains\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases\nin the test. The first line of each test case contains one integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the number of cards in the deck. The second\nline of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    s_1, s_2, \n    \u2026, s_n\n\n(\n    0 \n    \u2264 s_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 card powers in top-down order. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    5000\n. Output Output \n    t\n numbers, each of which is the answer to the\ncorresponding test case \u2014 the maximum possible total power of the army that\ncan be achieved. Example Input 5 5 3 3 3 0 0 6 0 3 3 0 0 3 7 1 2 3 0 4 5 0 7 1\n2 5 0 4 3 0 5 3 1 0 0 4 Output 6 6 8 9 4 Note In the first sample, you can\ntake bonuses \n    1\n and \n    2\n. Both hero cards will receive \n    3\n power.\nIf you take all the bonuses, one of them will remain unused. In the second\nsample, the hero's card on top of the deck cannot be powered up, and the rest\ncan be powered up with \n    2\n and \n    3\n bonuses and get \n    6\n total\npower. In the fourth sample, you can take bonuses \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    3\n,\n\n    5\n and skip the bonus \n    6\n, then the hero \n    4\n will be enhanced\nwith a bonus \n    3\n by \n    5\n, and the hero \n    7\n with a bonus \n    5\n by\n\n    4\n. \n    4+5=9\n.\n\n",
