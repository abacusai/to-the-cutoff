        "description": "Given a sequence \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n, find the minimum number of\nelements to remove from the sequence such that after the removal, the sum of\nevery \n    2\n consecutive elements is even. Input Each test contains multiple\ntest cases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The second line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u226410^9\n) \u2014\nelements of the sequence. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print a\nsingle integer \u2014 the minimum number of elements to remove from the sequence\nsuch that the sum of every \n    2\n consecutive elements is even. Example Input\n2 5 2 4 3 6 8 6 3 5 9 7 1 3 Output 1 0 Note In the first test case, after\nremoving \n    3\n, the sequence becomes \n    [2,4,6,8]\n. The pairs of\nconsecutive elements are \n    [2, 4], [4, 6], [6, 8]\n. Each\nconsecutive pair has an even sum now. Hence, we only need to remove \n    1\n\nelement to satisfy the condition asked. In the second test case, each\nconsecutive pair already has an even sum so we need not remove any element.\n\n",
