If you rotate some digit, it increases by one, except 9\nwhich becomes 0. Initially, the lock contains number \n    x\n. To unlock the\nsafe you must do the following operations in order (and be careful, don't mix\nup if and else statements). If sum of digits on positions 3 and 4 is greater\nthan 10, rotate digit on position 2 by 9 times, else rotate digit on position\n5 by 4 times. If digit on position 3 is greater than digit on position 5,\nrotate digit on position 2 by 4 times, else rotate digit on position 4 by 6\ntimes. If digit on position 5 is greater than digit on position 3, rotate\ndigit on position 2 by 1 times, else rotate digit on position 1 by 7 times. If\nsum of digits on positions 4 and 1 is greater than 8, rotate digit on position\n2 by 7 times, else rotate digit on position 3 by 3 times. If digit on position\n4 is greater than digit on position 1, rotate digit on position 2 by 3 times,\nelse rotate digit on position 3 by 2 times.
