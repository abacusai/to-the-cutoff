        "description": "There are \n    n\n coins labeled from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Initially, coin\n\n    c_i\n is on position \n    i\n and is facing upwards ((\n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026,\n    c_n)\n is a permutation of numbers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n). You can do some\noperations on these coins. In one operation, you can do the following: Choose\n\n    2\n distinct indices \n    i\n and \n    j\n. Then, swap the coins on\npositions \n    i\n and \n    j\n. Then, flip both coins on positions \n    i\n and\n\n    j\n. (If they are initially faced up, they will be faced down after the\noperation and vice versa) Construct a sequence of at most \n    n+1\n operations\nsuch that after performing all these operations the coin \n    i\n will be on\nposition \n    i\n at the end, facing up. Note that you do not need to minimize\nthe number of operations. Input The first line contains an integer \n    n\n\n(\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of coins. The second\nline contains \n    n\n integers \n    c_1,c_2,\n    \u2026,c_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264\n    n\n, \n    c_i \n    \u2260 c_j\n for \n    i\n    \u2260 j\n). Output In the first line,\noutput an integer \n    q\n \n    (0 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 n+1)\n \u2014 the number of\noperations you used. In the following \n    q\n lines, output two integers\n\n    i\n and \n    j\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 i, j \n    \u2264 n, i \n     j)\n \u2014 the positions\nyou chose for the current operation. Examples Input 3 2 1 3 Output 3 1 3 3 2 3\n1 Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 0 Note Let coin \n    i\n facing upwards be denoted\nas \n    i\n and coin \n    i\n facing downwards be denoted as \n    -i\n. The\nseries of moves performed in the first sample changes the coins as such:\n\n    [\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03]\n \n    [-3,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01,-2]\n \n    [-3,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02,-1]\n\n\n    [\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03]\n In the second sample, the coins are already in their\ncorrect positions so there is no need to swap.\n\n",
