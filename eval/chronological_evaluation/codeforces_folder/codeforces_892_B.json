The bell rings and every person kills\nsome of people in front of him. All people kill others at the same time.\nNamely, the i-th person kills the j-th person if and only if j < i and j \u2265 i -\nLi. You are given lengths of the claws. You need to find the total number of\nalive people after the bell rings. Input The first line contains one integer n\n(1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of guilty people. Second line contains n space-\nseparated integers L1, L2, ..., Ln (0 \u2264 Li \u2264 10^9), where Li is the length of\nthe i-th person's claw. Output Print one integer \u2014 the total number of alive\npeople after the bell rings. Examples Input 4 0 1 0 10 Output 1 Input 2 0 0\nOutput 2 Input 10 1 1 3 0 0 0 2 1 0 3 Output 3 Note In first sample the last\nperson kills everyone in front of him.\n\n",
