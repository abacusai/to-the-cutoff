        "description": "Inzane finally found Zane with a lot of money to spare, so they together\ndecided to establish a country of their own. Ruling a country is not an easy\njob. Thieves and terrorists are always ready to ruin the country's peace. To\nfight back, Zane and Inzane have enacted a very effective law: from each city\nit must be possible to reach a police station by traveling at most d\nkilometers along the roads. There are n cities in the country, numbered from 1\nto n, connected only by exactly n - 1 roads. All roads are 1 kilometer long.\nIt is initially possible to travel from a city to any other city using these\nroads. The country also has k police stations located in some cities. In\nparticular, the city's structure satisfies the requirement enforced by the\npreviously mentioned law. Also note that there can be multiple police stations\nin one city. However, Zane feels like having as many as n - 1 roads is\nunnecessary. The country is having financial issues, so it wants to minimize\nthe road maintenance cost by shutting down as many roads as possible. Help\nZane find the maximum number of roads that can be shut down without breaking\nthe law. Also, help him determine such roads. Input The first line contains\nthree integers n, k, and d (2 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 3\u00b710^5, 0 \u2264 d \u2264 n - 1) \u2014\nthe number of cities, the number of police stations, and the distance\nlimitation in kilometers, respectively. The second line contains k integers\np1, p2, ..., pk (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 n) \u2014 each denoting the city each police station is\nlocated in. The i-th of the following n - 1 lines contains two integers ui and\nvi (1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264 n, ui \u2260 vi) \u2014 the cities directly connected by the road with\nindex i. It is guaranteed that it is possible to travel from one city to any\nother city using only the roads. Also, it is possible from any city to reach a\npolice station within d kilometers. Output In the first line, print one\ninteger s that denotes the maximum number of roads that can be shut down. In\nthe second line, print s distinct integers, the indices of such roads, in any\norder. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. Examples Input 6 2 4\n1 6 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 Output 1 5 Input 6 3 2 1 5 6 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 5 6\nOutput 2 4 5 Note In the first sample, if you shut down road 5, all cities can\nstill reach a police station within k = 4 kilometers. In the second sample,\nalthough this is the only largest valid set of roads that can be shut down,\nyou can print either 4 5 or 5 4 in the second line.\n\n",
