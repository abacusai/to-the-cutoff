        "description": "Theofanis decided to visit his uncle's farm. There are \n    s\n animals and\n\n    n\n animal pens on the farm. For utility purpose, animal pens are\nconstructed in one row. Uncle told Theofanis that a farm is lucky if you can\ndistribute all animals in all pens in such a way that there are no empty pens\nand there is at least one continuous segment of pens that has exactly \n    k\n\nanimals in total. Moreover, a farm is ideal if it's lucky for any distribution\nwithout empty pens. Neither Theofanis nor his uncle knows if their farm is\nideal or not. Can you help them to figure it out? Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The first and only line of each test case contains three integers\n\n    s\n, \n    n\n, and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 s, n, k \n    \u2264 10^18\n; \n    n \n    \u2264\n    s\n). Output For each test case, print YES (case-insensitive), if the farm is\nideal, or NO (case-insensitive) otherwise. Example Input 4 1 1 1 1 1 2 100 50\n200 56220 47258 14497 Output YES NO NO YES Note For the first and the second\ntest case, the only possible combination is \n    [1]\n so there always will be\na subsegment with \n    1\n animal but not with \n    2\n animals.\n\n",
