        "description": "The sequence of integer pairs (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (ak, bk) is beautiful,\nif the following statements are fulfilled: 1 \u2264 a1 \u2264 b1 < a2 \u2264 b2 < ... < ak \u2264\nbk \u2264 n, where n is a given positive integer; all numbers b1 - a1, b2 - a2,\n..., bk - ak are distinct. For the given number n find the number of beautiful\nsequences of length k. As the answer can be rather large, print the remainder\nafter dividing it by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Input The first line contains\ninteger t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of the test data. Each of the next t\nlines contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 1000). Output For each test\nfrom the input print the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\nPrint the answers to the tests in the order in which the tests are given in\nthe input. Examples Input 6 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 3 2 3 3 Output 1 3 0 6 2 0 Note In\nthe first test sample there is exactly one beautiful sequence: (1, 1). In the\nsecond test sample, the following sequences are beautiful: (1, 1); (1, 2); (2,\n2). In the fourth test sample, the following sequences are beautiful: (1, 1);\n(1, 2); (1, 3); (2, 2); (2, 3); (3, 3). In the fifth test sample, the\nfollowing sequences are beautiful: (1, 1), (2, 3); (1, 2), (3, 3). In the\nthird and sixth samples, there are no beautiful sequences.\n\n",
