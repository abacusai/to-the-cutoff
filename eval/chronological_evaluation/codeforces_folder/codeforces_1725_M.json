        "description": "Pak Chanek is playing one of his favourite board games. In the game, there is\na directed graph with \n    N\n vertices and \n    M\n edges. In the graph, edge\n\n    i\n connects two different vertices \n    U_i\n and \n    V_i\n with a length\nof \n    W_i\n. By using the \n    i\n-th edge, something can move from \n    U_i\n\nto \n    V_i\n, but not from \n    V_i\n to \n    U_i\n. To play this game,\ninitially Pak Chanek must place both of his hands onto two different vertices.\nIn one move, he can move one of his hands to another vertex using an edge. To\nmove a hand from vertex \n    U_i\n to vertex \n    V_i\n, Pak Chanek needs a time\nof \n    W_i\n seconds. Note that Pak Chanek can only move one hand at a time.\nThis game ends when both of Pak Chanek's hands are on the same vertex. Pak\nChanek has several questions. For each \n    p\n satisfying \n    2 \n    \u2264 p \n    \u2264\n    N\n, you need to find the minimum time in seconds needed for Pak Chanek to\nend the game if initially Pak Chanek's left hand and right hand are placed on\nvertex \n    1\n and vertex \n    p\n, or report if it is impossible. Input The\nfirst line contains two integers \n    N\n and \n    M\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 M \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of vertices and\nedges in the graph. The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    M\n lines contains three\nintegers \n    U_i\n, \n    V_i\n, and \n    W_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 U_i, V_i \n    \u2264 N\n,\n\n    U_i \n    \u2260 V_i\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 W_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 a directed edge that\nconnects two different vertices \n    U_i\n and \n    V_i\n with a length of\n\n    W_i\n. There is no pair of different edges \n    i\n and \n    j\n such that\n\n    U_i = U_j\n and \n    V_i = V_j\n. Output Output a line containing \n    N-1\n\nintegers. The \n    j\n-th integer represents the minimum time in seconds needed\nby Pak Chanek to end the game if initially Pak Chanek's left hand and right\nhand are placed on vertex \n    1\n and vertex \n    j+1\n, or \n    -1\n if it is\nimpossible. Example Input 5 7 1 2 2 2 4 1 4 1 4 2 5 3 5 4 1 5 2 4 2 1 1 Output\n1 -1 3 4 Note If initially Pak Chanek's left hand is on vertex \n    1\n and his\nright hand is on vertex \n    5\n, Pak Chanek can do the following moves: Move\nhis right hand to vertex \n    4\n in \n    1\n second. Move his left hand to\nvertex \n    2\n in \n    2\n seconds. Move his left hand to vertex \n    4\n in\n\n    1\n second. In total it needs \n    1+2+1=4\n seconds. It can be proven that\nthere is no other way that is faster.\n\n",
