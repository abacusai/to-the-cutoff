        "description": "Ira is developing a computer game. This game features randomized generation\nand difficulty of levels. To achieve randomized difficulty, some enemies in\neach level are randomly replaced with stronger ones. To describe how do the\nlevels in the game look, let's introduce a coordinate system in such a way\nthat \n    Ox\n axis goes from left to right, and \n    Oy\n axis goes from bottom\nto top. A level is a rectangle with opposite corners in points \n    (0, 0)\n\nand \n    (a, b)\n. Each enemy's position is a point in this rectangle. As for\nnow, Ira has implemented one type of enemy in the game, in two different\nversions \u2014 basic and upgraded. Both versions of enemies Ira has implemented\nfire laser rays in several directions: basic enemies fire four laser rays in\nfour directions: to the right (in the same direction as the vector \n    (1,\n    0)\n), to the left (in the same direction as the vector \n    (-1, 0)\n), up\n(in the same direction as the vector \n    (0, 1)\n), and down (in the same\ndirection as the vector \n    (0, -1)\n); upgraded enemies fire eight laser rays\nin eight directions: four directions listed for basic enemies, and four\ndirections corresponding to vectors \n    (1, 1)\n, \n    (1, -1)\n, \n    (-1,\n    1)\n, \n    (-1, -1)\n. Laser rays pass through enemies and are blocked only by\nthe borders of the level (sides of the rectangle that denotes the level).\nEnemies are unaffected by lasers. The level Ira is working on has \n    n\n\nenemies. The \n    i\n-th enemy is in the point \n    (x_i, y_i)\n, and it has a\nprobability of \n    p_i\n to be upgraded (it's either upgraded with probability\n\n    p_i\n, or basic with probability \n    1-p_i\n). All these events are\nindependent. Ira wants to estimate the expected difficulty. She considers that\na good way to evaluate the difficulty of the level is to count the number of\nparts in which the level is divided by the laser rays. So, she wants to\ncalculate the expected number of these parts. Help her to do the evaluation of\nthe level! Input The first line contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n; \n    2 \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number\nof enemies in the level and the dimensions of the level. Then \n    n\n lines\nfollow, the \n    i\n-th of them contains three integers \n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n\nand \n    p'_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 a - 1\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 y_i \n    \u2264 b - 1\n;\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 p'_i \n    \u2264 999999\n), meaning that the \n    i\n-th enemy is located\nat \n    (x_i, y_i)\n and has a probability of \n    p'_i/10^6\n to be\nupgraded. No two enemies are located in the same point. Output Print one\ninteger \u2014 the expected number of parts in which the lasers divide the level,\ntaken modulo \n    998244353\n (i. e. let the expected number of parts be\n\n    x/y\n as an irreducible fraction; you have to print \n    x \n    \u00b7\n    y^-1\n     998244353\n, where \n    y^-1\n is a number such that \n    y\n    \n    \u00b7 y^-1\n     998244353 = 1\n). Examples Input 1 2 2 1 1 500000\nOutput 6 Input 2 3 2 1 1 500000 2 1 500000 Output 499122187 Note Explanation\nto the first example: With probability \n    1/2\n, the only enemy is\nnot upgraded and the level looks like this (\n    4\n parts): With probability\n\n    1/2\n, the only enemy is upgraded and the level looks like this\n(\n    8\n parts): So, the expected number of parts is \n    4 \n    \u00b7\n    1/2 + 8 \n    \u00b7\n    1/2 = 6\n.\n\n",
