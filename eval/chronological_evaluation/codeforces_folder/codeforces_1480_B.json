        "name": "The Great Hero",
        "description": "The great hero guards the country where Homer lives. The hero has attack power\n\n    A\n and initial health value \n    B\n. There are \n    n\n monsters in front\nof the hero. The \n    i\n-th monster has attack power \n    a_i\n and initial\nhealth value \n    b_i\n. The hero or a monster is said to be living, if his or\nits health value is positive (greater than or equal to \n    1\n); and he or it\nis said to be dead, if his or its health value is non-positive (less than or\nequal to \n    0\n). In order to protect people in the country, the hero will\nfight with monsters until either the hero is dead or all the monsters are\ndead. In each fight, the hero can select an arbitrary living monster and fight\nwith it. Suppose the \n    i\n-th monster is selected, and the health values of\nthe hero and the \n    i\n-th monster are \n    x\n and \n    y\n before the fight,\nrespectively. After the fight, the health values of the hero and the\n\n    i\n-th monster become \n    x-a_i\n and \n    y-A\n, respectively. Note that\nthe hero can fight the same monster more than once. For the safety of the\npeople in the country, please tell them whether the great hero can kill all\nthe monsters (even if the great hero himself is dead after killing the last\nmonster). Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nDescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains three integers \n    A\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 A \n    \u2264 10^6\n), \n    B\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 B \n    \u2264 10^6\n) and \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nattack power of the great hero, the initial health value of the great hero,\nand the number of monsters. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n), where\n\n    a_i\n denotes the attack power of the \n    i\n-th monster. The third line\nof each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n), where \n    b_i\n denotes the initial health value\nof the \n    i\n-th monster. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case print the\nanswer: \"YES\" (without quotes) if the great hero can kill all the monsters.\nOtherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes). Example Input 5 3 17 1 2 16 10 999 3\n10 20 30 100 50 30 1000 1000 4 200 300 400 500 1000 1000 1000 1000 999 999 1\n1000 1000 999 999 1 1000000 999 Output YES YES YES NO YES Note In the first\nexample: There will be \n    6\n fights between the hero and the only monster.\nAfter that, the monster is dead and the health value of the hero becomes \n    17\n    - 6 \n    \u00d7 2 = 5 > 0\n. So the answer is \"YES\", and moreover, the hero is\nstill living. In the second example: After all monsters are dead, the health\nvalue of the hero will become \n    709\n, regardless of the order of all\nfights. So the answer is \"YES\". In the third example: A possible order is to\nfight with the \n    1\n-st, \n    2\n-nd, \n    3\n-rd and \n    4\n-th monsters.\nAfter all fights, the health value of the hero becomes \n    -400\n.\nUnfortunately, the hero is dead, but all monsters are also dead. So the answer\nis \"YES\". In the fourth example: The hero becomes dead but the monster is\nstill living with health value \n    1000 - 999 = 1\n. So the answer is \"NO\".\n\n",
