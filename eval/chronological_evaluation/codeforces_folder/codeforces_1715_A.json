        "description": "Stanley and Megan decided to shop in the \"Crossmarket\" grocery store, which\ncan be represented as a matrix with \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n columns. Stanley\nand Megan can move to an adjacent cell using \n    1\n unit of power. Two cells\nare considered adjacent if they share an edge. To speed up the shopping\nprocess, Megan brought her portals with her, and she leaves one in each cell\nshe visits (if there is no portal yet). If a person (Stanley or Megan) is in a\ncell with a portal, that person can use \n    1\n unit of power to teleport to\nany other cell with a portal, including Megan's starting cell. They decided to\nsplit up: Stanley will go from the upper-left cell (cell with coordinates\n\n    (1, 1)\n) to the lower-right cell (cell with coordinates \n    (n, m)\n),\nwhilst Megan needs to get from the lower-left cell (cell with coordinates\n\n    (n, 1)\n) to the upper-right cell (cell with coordinates \n    (1, m)\n).\nWhat is the minimum total energy needed for them both to do that? Note that\nthey can choose the time they move. Time does not affect energy. Input Each\ntest contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test\ncases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n). Description of the test cases\nfollows. The only line in the test case contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 10^5\n). Output For each test case print a\nsingle integer on a new line \u2013 the answer. Example Input 7 7 5 5 7 1 1 100000\n100000 57 228 1 5 5 1 Output 15 15 0 299998 340 5 5 Note In the first test\ncase they can stick to the following plan: Megan (red circle) moves to the\ncell \n    (7, 3)\n. Then she goes to the cell \n    (1, 3)\n, and Stanley (blue\ncircle) does the same. Stanley uses the portal in that cell (cells with\nportals are grey) to get to the cell \n    (7, 3)\n. Then he moves to his\ndestination \u2014 cell \n    (7, 5)\n. Megan also finishes her route and goes to the\ncell \n    (1, 5)\n. The total energy spent is \n    (2 + 6) + (2 + 1 + 2) + (2)=\n    15\n, which is our final answer.\n\n",
