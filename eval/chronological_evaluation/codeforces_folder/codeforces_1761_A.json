        "description": "You are given three integers \n    n\n, \n    a\n, and \n    b\n. Determine if there\nexist two permutations \n    p\n and \n    q\n of length \n    n\n, for which the\nfollowing conditions hold: The length of the longest common prefix of \n    p\n\nand \n    q\n is \n    a\n. The length of the longest common suffix of \n    p\n and\n\n    q\n is \n    b\n. A permutation of length \n    n\n is an array containing\neach integer from \n    1\n to \n    n\n exactly once. For example,\n\n    [2,3,1,5,4]\n is a permutation, but \n    [1,2,2]\n is not a permutation\n(\n    2\n appears twice in the array), and \n    [1,3,4]\n is also not a\npermutation (\n    n=3\n but there is \n    4\n in the array). Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\ntest cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three integers\n\n    n\n, \n    a\n, and \n    b\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 a,b\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 100\n). Output\nFor each test case, if such a pair of permutations exists, output \"Yes\";\notherwise, output \"No\". You can output each letter in any case (upper or\nlower). Example Input 4 1 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 1 4 1 1 Output Yes No No Yes Note In\nthe first test case, \n    [1]\n and \n    [1]\n form a valid pair. In the second\ntest case and the third case, we can show that such a pair of permutations\ndoesn't exist. In the fourth test case, \n    [1,2,3,4]\n and \n    [1,3,2,4]\n\nform a valid pair.\n\n",
