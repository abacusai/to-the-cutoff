        "description": "BubbleSquare social network is celebrating \n    13^th\n anniversary and it is\nrewarding its members with special edition BubbleSquare tokens. Every member\nreceives one personal token. Also, two additional tokens are awarded to each\nmember for every friend they have on the network. Yet, there is a twist \u2013\neveryone should end up with different number of tokens from all their friends.\nEach member may return one received token. Also, each two friends may agree to\neach return one or two tokens they have obtained on behalf of their\nfriendship. Input First line of input contains two integer numbers \n    n\n and\n\n    k\n (\n    2\n \n    \u2264\n \n    n\n \n    \u2264\n \n    12500\n, \n    1\n\n\n    \u2264\n \n    k\n \n    \u2264\n \n    1000000\n) - number of members in\nnetwork and number of friendships. Next \n    k\n lines contain two integer\nnumbers \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    1\n \n    \u2264\n \n    a_i\n, \n    b_i\n\n\n    \u2264\n \n    n\n, \n    a_i\n \n    \u2260\n \n    b_i\n) - meaning members\n\n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n are friends. Output First line of output should\nspecify the number of members who are keeping their personal token. The second\nline should contain space separated list of members who are keeping their\npersonal token. Each of the following \n    k\n lines should contain three space\nseparated numbers, representing friend pairs and number of tokens each of them\ngets on behalf of their friendship. Examples Input 2 1 1 2 Output 1 1 1 2 0\nInput 3 3 1 2 1 3 2 3 Output 0 1 2 0 2 3 1 1 3 2 Note In the first test case,\nonly the first member will keep its personal token and no tokens will be\nawarded for friendship between the first and the second member. In the second\ntest case, none of the members will keep their personal token. The first\nmember will receive two tokens (for friendship with the third member), the\nsecond member will receive one token (for friendship with the third member)\nand the third member will receive three tokens (for friendships with the first\nand the second member).\n\n",
