        "description": "Polycarp remembered the \n    2020\n-th year, and he is happy with the arrival\nof the new \n    2021\n-th year. To remember such a wonderful moment, Polycarp\nwants to represent the number \n    n\n as the sum of a certain number of\n\n    2020\n and a certain number of \n    2021\n. For example, if: \n    n=4041\n,\nthen the number \n    n\n can be represented as the sum \n    2020 + 2021\n;\n\n    n=4042\n, then the number \n    n\n can be represented as the sum \n    2021 +\n    2021\n; \n    n=8081\n, then the number \n    n\n can be represented as the sum\n\n    2020 + 2020 + 2020 + 2021\n; \n    n=8079\n, then the number \n    n\n cannot\nbe represented as the sum of the numbers \n    2020\n and \n    2021\n. Help\nPolycarp to find out whether the number \n    n\n can be represented as the sum\nof a certain number of numbers \n    2020\n and a certain number of numbers\n\n    2021\n. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow.\nEach test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014\nthe number that Polycarp wants to represent as the sum of the numbers\n\n    2020\n and \n    2021\n. Output For each test case, output on a separate\nline: \"YES\" if the number \n    n\n is representable as the sum of a certain\nnumber of \n    2020\n and a certain number of \n    2021\n; \"NO\" otherwise. You\ncan output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes\nand YES will be recognized as positive). Example Input 5 1 4041 4042 8081 8079\nOutput NO YES YES YES NO\n\n",
