        "name": "Upgrading Cities",
        "description": "There are \n    n\n cities in the kingdom \n    X\n, numbered from \n    1\n through\n\n    n\n. People travel between cities by some one-way roads. As a passenger,\nJATC finds it weird that from any city \n    u\n, he can't start a trip in it\nand then return back to it using the roads of the kingdom. That is, the\nkingdom can be viewed as an acyclic graph. Being annoyed by the traveling\nsystem, JATC decides to meet the king and ask him to do something. In\nresponse, the king says that he will upgrade some cities to make it easier to\ntravel. Because of the budget, the king will only upgrade those cities that\nare important or semi-important. A city \n    u\n is called important if for\nevery city \n    v \n    \u2260 u\n, there is either a path from \n    u\n to \n    v\n or\na path from \n    v\n to \n    u\n. A city \n    u\n is called semi-important if it\nis not important and we can destroy exactly one city \n    v \n    \u2260 u\n so that\n\n    u\n becomes important. The king will start to act as soon as he finds out\nall those cities. Please help him to speed up the process. Input The first\nline of the input contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 300\n     000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 300\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of cities\nand the number of one-way roads. Next \n    m\n lines describe the road system\nof the kingdom. Each of them contains two integers \n    u_i\n and \n    v_i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    u_i \n    \u2260 v_i\n), denoting one-way road\nfrom \n    u_i\n to \n    v_i\n. It is guaranteed, that the kingdoms' roads make\nan acyclic graph, which doesn't contain multiple edges and self-loops. Output\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of cities that the king has to upgrade.\nExamples Input 7 7 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 7 2 5 5 4 6 4 Output 4 Input 6 7 1 2 2 3 3 4\n1 5 5 3 2 6 6 4 Output 4 Note In the first example: Starting at the city\n\n    1\n we can reach all the other cities, except for the city \n    6\n. Also,\nfrom the city \n    6\n we cannot reach the city \n    1\n. Therefore, if we\ndestroy the city \n    6\n then the city \n    1\n will become important. So\n\n    1\n is a semi-important city. For city \n    2\n, the set of cities that\ncannot reach \n    2\n and cannot be reached by \n    2\n is \n    6\n.\nTherefore, destroying city \n    6\n will make the city \n    2\n important. So\ncity \n    2\n is also semi-important. For city \n    3\n, the set is \n    5,\n    6\n. As you can see, destroying either city \n    5\n or \n    6\n will not\nmake the city \n    3\n important. Therefore, it is neither important nor semi-\nimportant. For city \n    4\n, the set is empty. So \n    4\n is an important\ncity. The set for city \n    5\n is \n    3, 6\n and the set for city\n\n    6\n is \n    3, 5\n. Similarly to city \n    3\n, both of them are\nnot important nor semi-important. The city \n    7\n is important since we can\nreach it from all other cities. So we have two important cities (\n    4\n and\n\n    7\n) and two semi-important cities (\n    1\n and \n    2\n).In the second\nexample, the important cities are \n    1\n and \n    4\n. The semi-important\ncities are \n    2\n and \n    3\n.\n\n",
