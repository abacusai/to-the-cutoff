        "description": "Little Lesha loves listening to music via his smartphone. But the smartphone\ndoesn't have much memory, so Lesha listens to his favorite songs in a well-\nknown social network InTalk. Unfortunately, internet is not that fast in the\ncity of Ekaterinozavodsk and the song takes a lot of time to download. But\nLesha is quite impatient. The song's duration is T seconds. Lesha downloads\nthe first S seconds of the song and plays it. When the playback reaches the\npoint that has not yet been downloaded, Lesha immediately plays the song from\nthe start (the loaded part of the song stays in his phone, and the download is\ncontinued from the same place), and it happens until the song is downloaded\ncompletely and Lesha listens to it to the end. For q seconds of real time the\nInternet allows you to download q - 1 seconds of the track. Tell Lesha, for\nhow many times he will start the song, including the very first start. Input\nThe single line contains three integers T, S, q (2 \u2264 q \u2264 10^4, 1 \u2264 S < T \u2264\n10^5). Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of times the song will be\nrestarted. Examples Input 5 2 2 Output 2 Input 5 4 7 Output 1 Input 6 2 3\nOutput 1 Note In the first test, the song is played twice faster than it is\ndownloaded, which means that during four first seconds Lesha reaches the\nmoment that has not been downloaded, and starts the song again. After another\ntwo seconds, the song is downloaded completely, and thus, Lesha starts the\nsong twice. In the second test, the song is almost downloaded, and Lesha will\nstart it only once. In the third sample test the download finishes and Lesha\nfinishes listening at the same moment. Note that song isn't restarted in this\ncase.\n\n",
