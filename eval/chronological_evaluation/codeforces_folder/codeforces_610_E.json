        "description": "You are given a string s of length n, consisting of first k lowercase English\nletters. We define a c-repeat of some string q as a string, consisting of c\ncopies of the string q. For example, string \"acbacbacbacb\" is a 4-repeat of\nthe string \"acb\". Let's say that string a contains string b as a subsequence,\nif string b can be obtained from a by erasing some symbols. Let p be a string\nthat represents some permutation of the first k lowercase English letters. We\ndefine function d(p) as the smallest integer such that a d(p)-repeat of the\nstring p contains string s as a subsequence. There are m operations of one of\ntwo types that can be applied to string s: Replace all characters at positions\nfrom li to ri by a character ci. For the given p, that is a permutation of\nfirst k lowercase English letters, find the value of function d(p). All\noperations are performed sequentially, in the order they appear in the input.\nYour task is to determine the values of function d(p) for all operations of\nthe second type. Input The first line contains three positive integers n, m\nand k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 20000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10) \u2014 the length of the string\ns, the number of operations and the size of the alphabet respectively. The\nsecond line contains the string s itself. Each of the following lines m\ncontains a description of some operation: Operation of the first type starts\nwith 1 followed by a triple li, ri and ci, that denotes replacement of all\ncharacters at positions from li to ri by character ci (1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 n, ci is\none of the first k lowercase English letters). Operation of the second type\nstarts with 2 followed by a permutation of the first k lowercase English\nletters. Output For each query of the second type the value of function d(p).\nExamples Input 7 4 3 abacaba 1 3 5 b 2 abc 1 4 4 c 2 cba Output 6 5 Note After\nthe first operation the string s will be abbbbba. In the second operation the\nanswer is 6-repeat of abc: ABcaBcaBcaBcaBcAbc. After the third operation the\nstring s will be abbcbba. In the fourth operation the answer is 5-repeat of\ncba: cbAcBacBaCBacBA. Uppercase letters means the occurrences of symbols from\nthe string s.\n\n",
