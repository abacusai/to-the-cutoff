        "description": "You have a new professor of graph theory and he speaks very quickly. You come\nup with the following plan to keep up with his lecture and make notes. You\nknow two languages, and the professor is giving the lecture in the first one.\nThe words in both languages consist of lowercase English characters, each\nlanguage consists of several words. For each language, all words are distinct,\ni.e. they are spelled differently. Moreover, the words of these languages have\na one-to-one correspondence, that is, for each word in each language, there\nexists exactly one word in the other language having has the same meaning. You\ncan write down every word the professor says in either the first language or\nthe second language. Of course, during the lecture you write down each word in\nthe language in which the word is shorter. In case of equal lengths of the\ncorresponding words you prefer the word of the first language. You are given\nthe text of the lecture the professor is going to read. Find out how the\nlecture will be recorded in your notes. Input The first line contains two\nintegers, n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3000, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 3000) \u2014 the number of words in the\nprofessor's lecture and the number of words in each of these languages. The\nfollowing m lines contain the words. The i-th line contains two strings ai, bi\nmeaning that the word ai belongs to the first language, the word bi belongs to\nthe second language, and these two words have the same meaning. It is\nguaranteed that no word occurs in both languages, and each word occurs in its\nlanguage exactly once. The next line contains n space-separated strings c1,\nc2, ..., cn \u2014 the text of the lecture. It is guaranteed that each of the\nstrings ci belongs to the set of strings a1, a2, ... am. All the strings in\nthe input are non-empty, each consisting of no more than 10 lowercase English\nletters. Output Output exactly n words: how you will record the lecture in\nyour notebook. Output the words of the lecture in the same order as in the\ninput.
