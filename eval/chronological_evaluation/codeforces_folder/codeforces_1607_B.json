        "description": "The grasshopper is located on the numeric axis at the point with coordinate\n\n    x_0\n. Having nothing else to do he starts jumping between integer points\non the axis. Making a jump from a point with coordinate \n    x\n with a\ndistance \n    d\n to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a\ncoordinate \n    x - d\n, while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a\ncoordinate \n    x + d\n. The grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so\nfor each integer \n    i\n starting with \n    1\n the following holds: exactly\n\n    i\n minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly\n\n    i\n. So, in the first minutes he jumps by \n    1\n, then by \n    2\n, and so\non. The direction of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the\ngrasshopper was before the jump has an even coordinate, the grasshopper jumps\nto the left, otherwise he jumps to the right. For example, if after \n    18\n\nconsecutive jumps he arrives at the point with a coordinate \n    7\n, he will\njump by a distance of \n    19\n to the right, since \n    7\n is an odd number,\nand will end up at a point \n    7 + 19 = 26\n. Since \n    26\n is an even\nnumber, the next jump the grasshopper will make to the left by a distance of\n\n    20\n, and it will move him to the point \n    26 - 20 = 6\n. Find exactly\nwhich point the grasshopper will be at after exactly \n    n\n jumps. Input The\nfirst line of input contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. Each of the following \n    t\n lines contains two\nintegers \n    x_0\n (\n    -10^14\n    \u2264 x_0 \n    \u2264 10^14\n) and \n    n\n\n(\n    0 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^14\n) \u2014 the coordinate of the grasshopper's\ninitial position and the number of jumps. Output Print exactly \n    t\n lines.\nOn the \n    i\n-th line print one integer \u2014 the answer to the \n    i\n-th test\ncase \u2014 the coordinate of the point the grasshopper will be at after making\n\n    n\n jumps from the point \n    x_0\n.

Since\n\n    0\n is an even number, the first jump of length \n    1\n is made to the\nleft, and the grasshopper ends up at the point \n    0 - 1 = -1\n. Then, since\n\n    -1\n is an odd number, a jump of length \n    2\n is made to the right,\nbringing the grasshopper to the point with coordinate \n    -1 + 2 = 1\n.\n\n",
