        "description": "Polycarp has prepared \n    n\n competitive programming problems. The topic of\nthe \n    i\n-th problem is \n    a_i\n, and some problems' topics may coincide.\nPolycarp has to host several thematic contests. All problems in each contest\nshould have the same topic, and all contests should have pairwise distinct\ntopics. He may not use all the problems. It is possible that there are no\ncontests for some topics. Polycarp wants to host competitions on consecutive\ndays, one contest per day. Polycarp wants to host a set of contests in such a\nway that: number of problems in each contest is exactly twice as much as in\nthe previous contest (one day ago), the first contest can contain arbitrary\nnumber of problems; the total number of problems in all the contests should be\nmaximized. Your task is to calculate the maximum number of problems in the set\nof thematic contests. Note, that you should not maximize the number of\ncontests. Input The first line of the input contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of problems Polycarp has\nprepared. The second line of the input contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) where \n    a_i\n is the topic of\nthe \n    i\n-th problem. Output Print one integer \u2014 the maximum number of\nproblems in the set of thematic contests. Examples Input 18 2 1 2 10 2 10 10 2\n2 1 10 10 10 10 1 1 10 10 Output 14 Input 10 6 6 6 3 6 1000000000 3 3 6 6\nOutput 9 Input 3 1337 1337 1337 Output 3 Note In the first example the optimal\nsequence of contests is: \n    2\n problems of the topic \n    1\n, \n    4\n\nproblems of the topic \n    2\n, \n    8\n problems of the topic \n    10\n. In the\nsecond example the optimal sequence of contests is: \n    3\n problems of the\ntopic \n    3\n, \n    6\n problems of the topic \n    6\n. In the third example you\ncan take all the problems with the topic \n    1337\n (the number of such\nproblems is \n    3\n so the answer is \n    3\n) and host a single contest.\n\n",
