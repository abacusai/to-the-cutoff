        "name": "Little Artem and 2-SAT",
        "description": "Little Artem is a very smart programmer. He knows many different difficult\nalgorithms. Recently he has mastered in 2-SAT one. In computer science,\n2-satisfiability (abbreviated as 2-SAT) is the special case of the problem of\ndetermining whether a conjunction (logical AND) of disjunctions (logical OR)\nhave a solution, in which all disjunctions consist of no more than two\narguments (variables). For the purpose of this problem we consider only 2-SAT\nformulas where each disjunction consists of exactly two arguments. Consider\nthe following 2-SAT problem as an example: . Note that there might be\nnegations in 2-SAT formula (like for x1 and for x4). Artem now tries to solve\nas many problems with 2-SAT as possible. He found a very interesting one,\nwhich he can not solve yet. Of course, he asks you to help him. The problem\nis: given two 2-SAT formulas f and g, determine whether their sets of possible\nsolutions are the same. Otherwise, find any variables assignment x such that\nf(x) \u2260 g(x). Input The first line of the input contains three integers n, m1\nand m2 (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 m1, m2 \u2264 n^2) \u2014 the number of variables, the number\nof disjunctions in the first formula and the number of disjunctions in the\nsecond formula, respectively. Next m1 lines contains the description of 2-SAT\nformula f. The description consists of exactly m1 pairs of integers xi ( - n \u2264\nxi \u2264 n, xi \u2260 0) each on separate line, where xi > 0 corresponds to the\nvariable without negation, while xi < 0 corresponds to the variable with\nnegation. Each pair gives a single disjunction. Next m2 lines contains formula\ng in the similar format. Output If both formulas share the same set of\nsolutions, output a single word \"SIMILAR\" (without quotes). Otherwise output\nexactly n integers xi () \u2014 any set of values x such that f(x) \u2260 g(x). Examples\nInput 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 Output SIMILAR Input 2 1 1 1 2 1 -2 Output 0 0 Note First\nsample has two equal formulas, so they are similar by definition. In second\nsample if we compute first function with x1 = 0 and x2 = 0 we get the result\n0, because . But the second formula is 1, because .\n\n",
