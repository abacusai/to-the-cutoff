        "name": "Mike and Chocolate Thieves",
        "description": "Bad news came to Mike's village, some thieves stole a bunch of chocolates from\nthe local factory! Horrible! Aside from loving sweet things, thieves from this\narea are known to be very greedy. So after a thief takes his number of\nchocolates for himself, the next thief will take exactly k times more than the\nprevious one. The value of k (k > 1) is a secret integer known only to them.\nIt is also known that each thief's bag can carry at most n chocolates (if they\nintend to take more, the deal is cancelled) and that there were exactly four\nthieves involved. Sadly, only the thieves know the value of n, but rumours say\nthat the numbers of ways they could have taken the chocolates (for a fixed n,\nbut not fixed k) is m. Two ways are considered different if one of the thieves\n(they should be numbered in the order they take chocolates) took different\nnumber of chocolates in them. Mike want to track the thieves down, so he wants\nto know what their bags are and value of n will help him in that. Please find\nthe smallest possible value of n or tell him that the rumors are false and\nthere is no such n. Input The single line of input contains the integer m (1 \u2264\nm \u2264 10^15) \u2014 the number of ways the thieves might steal the chocolates, as\nrumours say. Output Print the only integer n \u2014 the maximum amount of\nchocolates that thieves' bags can carry. If there are more than one n\nsatisfying the rumors, print the smallest one. If there is no such n for a\nfalse-rumoured m, print - 1. Examples Input 1 Output 8 Input 8 Output 54 Input\n10 Output -1 Note In the first sample case the smallest n that leads to\nexactly one way of stealing chocolates is n = 8, whereas the amounts of\nstealed chocolates are (1, 2, 4, 8) (the number of chocolates stolen by each\nof the thieves). In the second sample case the smallest n that leads to\nexactly 8 ways is n = 54 with the possibilities: (1, 2, 4, 8), (1, 3, 9, 27),\n(2, 4, 8, 16), (2, 6, 18, 54), (3, 6, 12, 24), (4, 8, 16, 32), (5, 10, 20,\n40), (6, 12, 24, 48). There is no n leading to exactly 10 ways of stealing\nchocolates in the third sample case.\n\n",
