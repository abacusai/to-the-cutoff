        "name": "Counting Skyscrapers",
        "description": "A number of skyscrapers have been built in a line. The number of skyscrapers\nwas chosen uniformly at random between 2 and 314! (314 factorial, a very large\nnumber). The height of each skyscraper was chosen randomly and independently,\nwith height i having probability 2^-i for all positive integers i. The floors\nof a skyscraper with height i are numbered 0 through i - 1. To speed up\ntransit times, a number of zip lines were installed between skyscrapers.\nSpecifically, there is a zip line connecting the i-th floor of one skyscraper\nwith the i-th floor of another skyscraper if and only if there are no\nskyscrapers between them that have an i-th floor. Alice and Bob decide to\ncount the number of skyscrapers. Alice is thorough, and wants to know exactly\nhow many skyscrapers there are. She begins at the leftmost skyscraper, with a\ncounter at 1. She then moves to the right, one skyscraper at a time, adding 1\nto her counter each time she moves. She continues until she reaches the\nrightmost skyscraper. Bob is impatient, and wants to finish as fast as\npossible. He begins at the leftmost skyscraper, with a counter at 1. He moves\nfrom building to building using zip lines. At each stage Bob uses the highest\navailable zip line to the right, but ignores floors with a height greater than\nh due to fear of heights. When Bob uses a zip line, he travels too fast to\ncount how many skyscrapers he passed. Instead, he just adds 2^i to his\ncounter, where i is the number of the floor he's currently on. He continues\nuntil he reaches the rightmost skyscraper. Consider the following example.\nThere are 6 buildings, with heights 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2 from left to right, and h\n= 2. Alice begins with her counter at 1 and then adds 1 five times for a\nresult of 6. Bob begins with his counter at 1, then he adds 1, 4, 4, and 2, in\norder, for a result of 12. Note that Bob ignores the highest zip line because\nof his fear of heights (h = 2). Bob's counter is at the top of the image, and\nAlice's counter at the bottom. All zip lines are shown. Bob's path is shown by\nthe green dashed line and Alice's by the pink dashed line. The floors of the\nskyscrapers are numbered, and the zip lines Bob uses are marked with the\namount he adds to his counter. When Alice and Bob reach the right-most\nskyscraper, they compare counters. You will be given either the value of\nAlice's counter or the value of Bob's counter, and must compute the expected\nvalue of the other's counter. Input The first line of input will be a name,\neither string \"Alice\" or \"Bob\". The second line of input contains two integers\nn and h (2 \u2264 n \u2264 30000, 0 \u2264 h \u2264 30). If the name is \"Alice\", then n represents\nthe value of Alice's counter when she reaches the rightmost skyscraper,\notherwise n represents the value of Bob's counter when he reaches the\nrightmost skyscraper; h represents the highest floor number Bob is willing to\nuse. Output Output a single real value giving the expected value of the\nAlice's counter if you were given Bob's counter, or Bob's counter if you were\ngiven Alice's counter. You answer will be considered correct if its absolute\nor relative error doesn't exceed 10^-9. Examples Input Alice 3 1 Output\n3.500000000 Input Bob 2 30 Output 2 Input Alice 2572 10 Output 3439.031415943\nNote In the first example, Bob's counter has a 62.5\nchance of being 4, and a 12.5\n\n",
