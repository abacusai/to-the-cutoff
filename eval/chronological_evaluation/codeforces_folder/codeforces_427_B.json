        "description": "The prison of your city has n prisoners. As the prison can't accommodate all\nof them, the city mayor has decided to transfer c of the prisoners to a prison\nlocated in another city. For this reason, he made the n prisoners to stand in\na line, with a number written on their chests. The number is the severity of\nthe crime he/she has committed. The greater the number, the more severe\nhis/her crime was. Then, the mayor told you to choose the c prisoners, who\nwill be transferred to the other prison. He also imposed two conditions. They\nare, The chosen c prisoners has to form a contiguous segment of prisoners. Any\nof the chosen prisoner's crime level should not be greater then t. Because,\nthat will make the prisoner a severe criminal and the mayor doesn't want to\ntake the risk of his running away during the transfer. Find the number of ways\nyou can choose the c prisoners. Input The first line of input will contain\nthree space separated integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5), t (0 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9) and c (1 \u2264\nc \u2264 n). The next line will contain n space separated integers, the i^th\ninteger is the severity i^th prisoner's crime. The value of crime severities\nwill be non-negative and will not exceed 10^9. Output Print a single integer \u2014\nthe number of ways you can choose the c prisoners. Examples Input 4 3 3 2 3 1\n1 Output 2 Input 1 1 1 2 Output 0 Input 11 4 2 2 2 0 7 3 2 2 4 9 1 4 Output 6\n\n",
