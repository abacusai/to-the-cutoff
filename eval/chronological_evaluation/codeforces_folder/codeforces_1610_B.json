        "name": "Kalindrome Array",
        "description": "An array \n    [b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_m]\n is a palindrome, if \n    b_i =\n    b_m+1-i\n for each \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    m\n. Empty array is also a\npalindrome. An array is called kalindrome, if the following condition holds:\nIt's possible to select some integer \n    x\n and delete some of the elements\nof the array equal to \n    x\n, so that the remaining array (after gluing\ntogether the remaining parts) is a palindrome. Note that you don't have to\ndelete all elements equal to \n    x\n, and you don't have to delete at least\none element equal to \n    x\n. For example : \n    [1, 2, 1]\n is kalindrome\nbecause you can simply not delete a single element. \n    [3, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n is\nkalindrome because you can choose \n    x = 3\n and delete both elements equal\nto \n    3\n, obtaining array \n    [1, 2, 1]\n, which is a palindrome. \n    [1, 2,\n    3]\n is not kalindrome. You are given an array \n    [a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n]\n. Determine if \n    a\n is kalindrome or not. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each\ntest case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\nelements of the array. It's guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases won't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print YES\nif \n    a\n is kalindrome and NO otherwise. You can print each letter in any\ncase. Example Input 4 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 5 1 4 4 1 4 Output YES YES NO YES Note\nIn the first test case, array \n    [1]\n is already a palindrome, so it's a\nkalindrome as well. In the second test case, we can choose \n    x = 2\n, delete\nthe second element, and obtain array \n    [1]\n, which is a palindrome. In the\nthird test case, it's impossible to obtain a palindrome. In the fourth test\ncase, you can choose \n    x = 4\n and delete the fifth element, obtaining\n\n    [1, 4, 4, 1]\n. You also can choose \n    x = 1\n, delete the first and the\nfourth elements, and obtain \n    [4, 4, 4]\n.\n\n",
