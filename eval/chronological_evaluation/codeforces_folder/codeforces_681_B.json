        "description": "Kolya is developing an economy simulator game. His most favourite part of the\ndevelopment process is in-game testing. Once he was entertained by the testing\nso much, that he found out his game-coin score become equal to 0. Kolya\nremembers that at the beginning of the game his game-coin score was equal to n\nand that he have bought only some houses (for 1 234 567 game-coins each), cars\n(for 123 456 game-coins each) and computers (for 1 234 game-coins each). Kolya\nis now interested, whether he could have spent all of his initial n game-coins\nbuying only houses, cars and computers or there is a bug in the game.\nFormally, is there a triple of non-negative integers a, b and c such that a \u00d7\n1 234 567 + b \u00d7 123 456 + c \u00d7 1 234 = n? Please help Kolya answer this\nquestion. Input The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n\n\u2264 10^9) \u2014 Kolya's initial game-coin score. Output Print \"YES\" (without quotes)\nif it's possible that Kolya spent all of his initial n coins buying only\nhouses, cars and computers. Otherwise print \"NO\" (without quotes). Examples\nInput 1359257 Output YES Input 17851817 Output NO Note In the first sample,\none of the possible solutions is to buy one house, one car and one computer,\nspending 1 234 567 + 123 456 + 1234 = 1 359 257 game-coins in total.\n\n",
