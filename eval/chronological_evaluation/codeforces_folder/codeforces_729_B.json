        "description": "Theater stage is a rectangular field of size n \u00d7 m. The director gave you the\nstage's plan which actors will follow. For each cell it is stated in the plan\nif there would be an actor in this cell or not. You are to place a spotlight\non the stage in some good position. The spotlight will project light in one of\nthe four directions (if you look at the stage from above) \u2014 left, right, up or\ndown. Thus, the spotlight's position is a cell it is placed to and a direction\nit shines. A position is good if two conditions hold: there is no actor in the\ncell the spotlight is placed to; there is at least one actor in the direction\nthe spotlight projects. Count the number of good positions for placing the\nspotlight. Two positions of spotlight are considered to be different if the\nlocation cells or projection direction differ. Input The first line contains\ntwo positive integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of rows and the\nnumber of columns in the plan. The next n lines contain m integers, 0 or 1\neach \u2014 the description of the plan. Integer 1, means there will be an actor in\nthe corresponding cell, while 0 means the cell will remain empty. It is\nguaranteed that there is at least one actor in the plan. Output Print one\ninteger \u2014 the number of good positions for placing the spotlight. Examples\nInput 2 4 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 Output 9 Input 4 4 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\nOutput 20 Note In the first example the following positions are good: the (1,\n1) cell and right direction; the (1, 1) cell and down direction; the (1, 3)\ncell and left direction; the (1, 3) cell and down direction; the (1, 4) cell\nand left direction; the (2, 2) cell and left direction; the (2, 2) cell and up\ndirection; the (2, 2) and right direction; the (2, 4) cell and left direction.\nTherefore, there are 9 good positions in this example.\n\n",
