        "description": "This is the hard version of this problem. The only difference between the easy\nand hard versions is the constraints on \n    k\n and \n    m\n. In this version\nof the problem, you need to output the answer by modulo \n    10^9+7\n. You are\ngiven a sequence \n    a\n of length \n    n\n consisting of integers from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n. The sequence may contain duplicates (i.e. some elements can be\nequal). Find the number of tuples of \n    m\n elements such that the maximum\nnumber in the tuple differs from the minimum by no more than \n    k\n.\nFormally, you need to find the number of tuples of \n    m\n indices \n    i_1 <\n    i_2 < \n    \u2026 < i_m\n, such that \n    \n\n    max(a_i_1, a_i_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_i_m) - \n    min(a_i_1, a_i_2, \n    \u2026, a_i_m) \n    \u2264 k.\n\n    \n For\nexample, if \n    n=4\n, \n    m=3\n, \n    k=2\n, \n    a=[1,2,4,3]\n, then there are\ntwo such triples (\n    i=1, j=2, z=4\n and \n    i=2, j=3, z=4\n). If \n    n=4\n,\n\n    m=2\n, \n    k=1\n, \n    a=[1,1,1,1]\n, then all six possible pairs are\nsuitable. As the result can be very large, you should print the value modulo\n\n    10^9 + 7\n (the remainder when divided by \n    10^9 + 7\n). Input The first\nline contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of\neach test case contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 100\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\nthe length of the sequence \n    a\n, number of elements in the tuples and the\nmaximum difference of elements in the tuple. The next line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the\nsequence \n    a\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n for all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output Output \n    t\n answers to the\ngiven test cases. Each answer is the required number of tuples of \n    m\n\nelements modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n, such that the maximum value in the tuple\ndiffers from the minimum by no more than \n    k\n.
