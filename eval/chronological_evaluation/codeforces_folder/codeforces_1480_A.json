        "description": "Homer has two friends Alice and Bob. Both of them are string fans. One day,\nAlice and Bob decide to play a game on a string \n    s = s_1 s_2 \n    \u2026 s_n\n\nof length \n    n\n consisting of lowercase English letters. They move in turns\nalternatively and Alice makes the first move. In a move, a player must choose\nan index \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) that has not been chosen before,\nand change \n    s_i\n to any other lowercase English letter \n    c\n that \n    c\n    \n    \u2260 s_i\n. When all indices have been chosen, the game ends. The goal of\nAlice is to make the final string lexicographically as small as possible,\nwhile the goal of Bob is to make the final string lexicographically as large\nas possible. Both of them are game experts, so they always play games\noptimally. Homer is not a game expert, so he wonders what the final string\nwill be. A string \n    a\n is lexicographically smaller than a string \n    b\n\nif and only if one of the following holds: \n    a\n is a prefix of \n    b\n, but\n\n    a \n     b\n; in the first position where \n    a\n and \n    b\n differ, the\nstring \n    a\n has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the\ncorresponding letter in \n    b\n. Input Each test contains multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. Description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test\ncase contains a single string \n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 |s| \n    \u2264 50\n)\nconsisting of lowercase English letters. Output For each test case, print the\nfinal string in a single line. Example Input 3 a bbbb az Output b azaz by Note\nIn the first test case: Alice makes the first move and must change the only\nletter to a different one, so she changes it to 'b'. In the second test case:\nAlice changes the first letter to 'a', then Bob changes the second letter to\n'z', Alice changes the third letter to 'a' and then Bob changes the fourth\nletter to 'z'. In the third test case: Alice changes the first letter to 'b',\nand then Bob changes the second letter to 'y'.\n\n",
