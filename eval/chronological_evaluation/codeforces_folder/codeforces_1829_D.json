        "description": "Initially you have a single pile with \n    n\n gold nuggets. In an operation\nyou can do the following: Take any pile and split it into two piles, so that\none of the resulting piles has exactly twice as many gold nuggets as the\nother. (All piles should have an integer number of nuggets.) One possible move\nis to take a pile of size \n    6\n and split it into piles of sizes \n    2\n and\n\n    4\n, which is valid since \n    4\n is twice as large as \n    2\n. Can you\nmake a pile with exactly \n    m\n gold nuggets using zero or more operations?\nInput The first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains\ntwo integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 10^7\n) \u2014 the\nstarting and target pile sizes, respectively. Output For each test case,\noutput \"YES\" if you can make a pile of size exactly \n    m\n, and \"NO\"\notherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings\n\"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\nExample Input 11 6 4 9 4 4 2 18 27 27 4 27 2 27 10 1 1 3 1 5 1 746001 2984004\nOutput YES YES NO NO YES YES NO YES YES NO NO Note The first test case is\npictured in the statement. We can make a pile of size \n    4\n. In the second\ntest case, we can perform the following operations:\n\n    9\n    \n    \n    \u2192\n    \n    \n    6,3\n    \n    \n    \u2192\n    \n    4,2,3\n. The pile that is split apart is colored red before each\noperation. In the third test case, we can't perform a single operation. In the\nfourth test case, we can't end up with a larger pile than we started with.\n\n",
