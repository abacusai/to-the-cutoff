        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n containing the weather forecast for Berlandia\nfor the last \n    n\n days. That is, \n    a_i\n \u2014 is the estimated air\ntemperature on day \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n). You are also given an\narray \n    b\n \u2014 the air temperature that was actually present on each of the\ndays. However, all the values in array \n    b\n are mixed up. Determine which\nday was which temperature, if you know that the weather never differs from the\nforecast by more than \n    k\n degrees. In other words, if on day \n    i\n the\nreal air temperature was \n    c\n, then the equality \n    |a_i - c| \n    \u2264 k\n is\nalways true. For example, let an array \n    a\n = [\n    1, 3, 5, 3, 9\n] of\nlength \n    n = 5\n and \n    k = 2\n be given and an array \n    b\n = [\n    2, 5,\n    11, 2, 4\n]. Then, so that the value of \n    b_i\n corresponds to the air\ntemperature on day \n    i\n, we can rearrange the elements of the array \n    b\n\nso: [\n    2, 2, 5, 4, 11\n]. Indeed: On the \n    1\nst day, \n    |a_1 - b_1| = |1\n    - 2| = 1\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 2 = k\n is satisfied; On the \n    2\nnd day \n    |a_2 -\n    b_2| = |3 - 2| = 1\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 2 = k\n is satisfied; On the \n    3\nrd day,\n\n    |a_3 - b_3| = |5 - 5| = 0\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 2 = k\n is satisfied; On the\n\n    4\nth day, \n    |a_4 - b_4| = |3 - 4| = 1\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 2 = k\n is\nsatisfied; On the \n    5\nth day, \n    |a_5 - b_5| = |9 - 11| = 2\n, \n    2 \n    \u2264\n    2 = k\n is satisfied. Input The first line of input data contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains two integers \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) and \n    k\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 k \n    \u226410^9\n) \u2014 the number of days and the maximum difference between\nthe expected and actual air temperature on each day. The second line of each\ntest case contains exactly \n    n\n integers \u2014 elements of array \n    a\n\n(\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). The third line of each test case contains\nexactly \n    n\n integers \u2014 elements of array \n    b\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does\nnot exceed \n    10^5\n, and that the elements of array \n    b\n can always be\nrearranged so that the equality \n    |a_i - b_i| \n    \u2264 k\n is true for all\n\n    i\n. Output On a separate line for each test case, output exactly \n    n\n\nnumbers \u2014 the values of air temperature on each of the days in the correct\norder. If there is more than one answer \u2014 output any of them. Example Input 3\n5 2 1 3 5 3 9 2 5 11 2 4 6 1 -1 3 -2 0 -5 -1 -4 0 -1 4 0 0 3 3 7 7 7 9 4 8\nOutput 2 2 5 4 11 0 4 -1 0 -4 0 8 4 9\n\n",
