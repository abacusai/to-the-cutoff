        "description": "Volodya likes listening to heavy metal and (occasionally) reading. No wonder\nVolodya is especially interested in texts concerning his favourite music\nstyle. Volodya calls a string powerful if it starts with \"heavy\" and ends with\n\"metal\". Finding all powerful substrings (by substring Volodya means a\nsubsequence of consecutive characters in a string) in a given text makes our\nhero especially joyful. Recently he felt an enormous fit of energy while\nreading a certain text. So Volodya decided to count all powerful substrings in\nthis text and brag about it all day long. Help him in this difficult task. Two\nsubstrings are considered different if they appear at the different positions\nin the text. For simplicity, let us assume that Volodya's text can be\nrepresented as a single string. Input Input contains a single non-empty string\nconsisting of the lowercase Latin alphabet letters. Length of this string will\nnot be greater than 10^6 characters. Output Print exactly one number \u2014 the\nnumber of powerful substrings of the given string. Please, do not use the \nspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the\ncin, cout streams or the \nheavymetalisheavymetal Output 3 Input heavymetalismetal Output 2 Input\ntrueheavymetalissotruewellitisalsosoheavythatyoucanalmostfeeltheweightofmetalonyou\nOutput 3 Note In the first sample the string \"heavymetalisheavymetal\" contains\npowerful substring \"heavymetal\" twice, also the whole string\n\"heavymetalisheavymetal\" is certainly powerful. In the second sample the\nstring \"heavymetalismetal\" contains two powerful substrings: \"heavymetal\" and\n\"heavymetalismetal\".\n\n",
