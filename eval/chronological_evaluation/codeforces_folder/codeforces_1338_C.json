        "description": "Consider the infinite sequence \n    s\n of positive integers, created by\nrepeating the following steps: Find the lexicographically smallest triple of\npositive integers \n    (a, b, c)\n such that \n    a \n    \u2295 b \n    \u2295 c = 0\n,\nwhere \n    \u2295\n denotes the bitwise XOR operation. \n    a\n, \n    b\n,\n\n    c\n are not in \n    s\n. Here triple of integers \n    (a_1, b_1, c_1)\n is\nconsidered to be lexicographically smaller than triple \n    (a_2, b_2, c_2)\n\nif sequence \n    [a_1, b_1, c_1]\n is lexicographically smaller than sequence\n\n    [a_2, b_2, c_2]\n. Append \n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    c\n to \n    s\n in this\norder. Go back to the first step. You have integer \n    n\n. Find the\n\n    n\n-th element of \n    s\n. You have to answer \n    t\n independent test\ncases. A sequence \n    a\n is lexicographically smaller than a sequence \n    b\n\nif in the first position where \n    a\n and \n    b\n differ, the sequence\n\n    a\n has a smaller element than the corresponding element in \n    b\n. Input\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. Each of the next \n    t\n lines contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^16\n) \u2014 the position of the element\nyou want to know. Output In each of the \n    t\n lines, output the answer to\nthe corresponding test case. Example Input 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Output 1 2 3 4\n8 12 5 10 15 Note The first elements of \n    s\n are \n    1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 5,\n    10, 15, \n    \u2026\n\n\n",
