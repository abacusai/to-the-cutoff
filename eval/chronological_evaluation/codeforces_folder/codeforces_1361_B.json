        "description": "Johnny has just found the new, great tutorial: \"How to become a grandmaster?\".\nThe tutorial tells many strange and unexpected for Johnny things, such as you\nhave to be patient or that very important is solving many harder and harder\nproblems. The boy has found an online judge with tasks divided by topics they\ncover. He has picked \n    p^k_i\n problems from \n    i\n-th category (\n    p\n\nis his favorite number). He wants to solve them in two weeks (the patience\ncondition is too hard for Johnny, so for simplicity, he looks only at easy\ntasks, which can be solved in such a period). Now our future grandmaster has\nto decide which topics to cover first and which the second week. Help him\nassign topics in such a way, that workload is balanced. Formally, given\n\n    n\n numbers \n    p^k_i\n, the boy wants to divide them into two disjoint\nsets, minimizing the absolute difference between sums of numbers in each set.\nFind the minimal absolute difference. Output the result modulo \n    10^9+7\n.\nInput Input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one\ninteger \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5)\n \u2014 the number of test cases.\nEach test case is described as follows: The first line contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    p\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 n, p \n    \u2264 10^6)\n. The second line\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    k_i\n \n    (0 \n    \u2264 k_i \n    \u2264 10^6)\n. The sum\nof \n    n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed \n    10^6\n. Output Output one\ninteger \u2014 the reminder of division the answer by \n    1\n     000\n     000\n     007\n.\nExample Input 4 5 2 2 3 4 4 3 3 1 2 10 1000 4 5 0 1 1 100 1 8 89 Output 4 1\n146981438 747093407 Note You have to minimize the difference, not it's\nremainder. For example, if the minimum difference is equal to \n    2\n, but\nthere is also a distribution where the difference is \n    10^9 + 8\n, then the\nanswer is \n    2\n, not \n    1\n. In the first test case of the example,\nthere're the following numbers: \n    4\n, \n    8\n, \n    16\n, \n    16\n, and\n\n    8\n. We can divide them into such two sets: \n    4, 8, 16\n and \n    8,\n    16\n. Then the difference between the sums of numbers in sets would be\n\n    4\n.\n\n",
