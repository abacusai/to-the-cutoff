        "description": "You are creating a level for a video game. The level consists of \n    n\n rooms\nplaced in a circle. The rooms are numbered \n    1\n through \n    n\n. Each room\ncontains exactly one exit: completing the \n    j\n-th room allows you to go the\n\n    (j+1)\n-th room (and completing the \n    n\n-th room allows you to go the\n\n    1\n-st room). You are given the description of the multiset of \n    n\n\nchests: the \n    i\n-th chest has treasure value \n    c_i\n. Each chest can be\nof one of two types: regular chest \u2014 when a player enters a room with this\nchest, he grabs the treasure and proceeds to the next room; mimic chest \u2014 when\na player enters a room with this chest, the chest eats him alive, and he\nloses. The player starts in a random room with each room having an equal\nprobability of being chosen. The players earnings is equal to the total value\nof treasure chests he'd collected before he lost. You are allowed to choose\nthe order the chests go into the rooms. For each \n    k\n from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n place the chests into the rooms in such a way that: each room contains\nexactly one chest; exactly \n    k\n chests are mimics; the expected value of\nplayers earnings is minimum possible. Please note that for each \n    k\n the\nplacement is chosen independently. It can be shown that it is in the form of\n\n    P/Q\n where \n    P\n and \n    Q\n are non-negative integers and\n\n    Q \n     0\n. Report the values of \n    P \n    \u00b7 Q^-1\n    998244353\n. Input The first contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264\n    n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of rooms and the number of chests. The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    c_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the treasure values of each chest. Output Print \n    n\n\nintegers \u2014 the \n    k\n -th value should be equal to the minimum possible\nexpected value of players earnings if the chests are placed into the rooms in\nsome order and exactly \n    k\n of the chests are mimics. It can be shown that\nit is in the form of \n    P/Q\n where \n    P\n and \n    Q\n are non-\nnegative integers and \n    Q \n     0\n. Report the values of \n    P \n    \u00b7\n    Q^-1\n    998244353\n.
