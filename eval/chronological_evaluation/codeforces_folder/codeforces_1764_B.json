        "description": "\"Everybody! Doremy's Perfect Math Class is about to start! Come and do your\nbest if you want to have as much IQ as me!\" In today's math class, Doremy is\nteaching everyone subtraction. Now she gives you a quiz to prove that you are\npaying attention in class. You are given a set \n    S\n containing positive\nintegers. You may perform the following operation some (possibly zero) number\nof times: choose two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n from the set \n    S\n such\nthat \n    x > y\n and \n    x - y\n is not in the set \n    S\n. add \n    x-y\n into\nthe set \n    S\n. You need to tell Doremy the maximum possible number of\nintegers in \n    S\n if the operations are performed optimally. It can be\nproven that this number is finite. Input The input consists of multiple test\ncases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the size of the set \n    S\n. The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 a_1 < a_2 < \n    \u22ef < a_n \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) \u2014 the positive integers in \n    S\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case, you need to output the maximum possible number of integers in\n\n    S\n. It can be proven that this value is finite. Example Input 2 2 1 2 3 5\n10 25 Output 2 5 Note In the first test case, no such \n    x\n and \n    y\n\nexist. The maximum possible number of integers in \n    S\n is \n    2\n. In the\nsecond test case, \n    S=\n    \n    5,10,25\n at first. You can choose\n\n    x=25\n, \n    y=10\n, then add \n    x-y=15\n to the set.\n\n    S=\n    \n    5,10,15,25\n now. You can choose \n    x=25\n, \n    y=5\n, then\nadd \n    x-y=20\n to the set. \n    S=\n    \n    5,10,15,20,25\n now. You can not\nperform any operation now. After performing all operations, the number of\nintegers in \n    S\n is \n    5\n. It can be proven that no other sequence of\noperations allows \n    S\n to contain more than \n    5\n integers.\n\n",
