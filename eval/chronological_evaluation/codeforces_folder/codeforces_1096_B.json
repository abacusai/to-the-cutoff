        "name": "Substring Removal",
        "description": "You are given a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting only of lowercase\nLatin letters. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that\nstring. So, string \"forces\" is substring of string \"codeforces\", but string\n\"coder\" is not. Your task is to calculate the number of ways to remove exactly\none substring from this string in such a way that all remaining characters are\nequal (the number of distinct characters either zero or one). It is guaranteed\nthat there is at least two different characters in \n    s\n. Note that you can\nremove the whole string and it is correct. Also note that you should remove at\nleast one character. Since the answer can be rather large (not very large\nthough) print it modulo \n    998244353\n. If you are Python programmer,\nconsider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the string \n    s\n. The second line of the\ninput contains the string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting only of\nlowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that there is at least two different\ncharacters in \n    s\n. Output Print one integer \u2014 the number of ways modulo\n\n    998244353\n to remove exactly one substring from \n    s\n in such way that\nall remaining characters are equal. Examples Input 4 abaa Output 6 Input 7\naacdeee Output 6 Input 2 az Output 3 Note Let \n    s[l; r]\n be the substring\nof \n    s\n from the position \n    l\n to the position \n    r\n inclusive. Then\nin the first example you can remove the following substrings: \n    s[1; 2]\n;\n\n    s[1; 3]\n; \n    s[1; 4]\n; \n    s[2; 2]\n; \n    s[2; 3]\n; \n    s[2; 4]\n. In\nthe second example you can remove the following substrings: \n    s[1; 4]\n;\n\n    s[1; 5]\n; \n    s[1; 6]\n; \n    s[1; 7]\n; \n    s[2; 7]\n; \n    s[3; 7]\n. In\nthe third example you can remove the following substrings: \n    s[1; 1]\n;\n\n    s[1; 2]\n; \n    s[2; 2]\n.\n\n",
