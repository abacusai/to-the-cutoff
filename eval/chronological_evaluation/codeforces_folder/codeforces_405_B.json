        "description": "Little Chris knows there's no fun in playing dominoes, he thinks it's too\nrandom and doesn't require skill. Instead, he decided to play with the\ndominoes and make a \"domino show\". Chris arranges n dominoes in a line,\nplacing each piece vertically upright. In the beginning, he simultaneously\npushes some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right. However,\nsomewhere between every two dominoes pushed in the same direction there is at\nleast one domino pushed in the opposite direction. After each second, each\ndomino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left.\nSimilarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes\nstanding on the right. When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from\nboth sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces. The figure shows\none possible example of the process. Given the initial directions Chris has\npushed the dominoes, find the number of the dominoes left standing vertically\nat the end of the process! Input The first line contains a single integer n (1\n\u2264 n \u2264 3000), the number of the dominoes in the line. The next line contains a\ncharacter string s of length n. The i-th character of the string si is equal\nto \"L\", if the i-th domino has been pushed to the left; \"R\", if the i-th\ndomino has been pushed to the right; \".\", if the i-th domino has not been\npushed. It is guaranteed that if si = sj = \"L\" and i < j, then there exists\nsuch k that i < k < j and sk = \"R\"; if si = sj = \"R\" and i < j, then there\nexists such k that i < k < j and sk = \"L\". Output Output a single integer, the\nnumber of the dominoes that remain vertical at the end of the process.\nExamples Input 14 .L.R...LR..L.. Output 4 Input 5 R.... Output 0 Input 1 .\nOutput 1 Note The first example case is shown on the figure. The four pieces\nthat remain standing vertically are highlighted with orange. In the second\nexample case, all pieces fall down since the first piece topples all the other\npieces. In the last example case, a single piece has not been pushed in either\ndirection.\n\n",
