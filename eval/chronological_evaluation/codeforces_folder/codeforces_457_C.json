        "description": "You are running for a governor in a small city in Russia. You ran some polls\nand did some research, and for every person in the city you know whom he will\nvote for, and how much it will cost to bribe that person to vote for you\ninstead of whomever he wants to vote for right now. You are curious, what is\nthe smallest amount of money you need to spend on bribing to win the\nelections. To win elections you need to have strictly more votes than any\nother candidate. Input First line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014\nnumber of voters in the city. Each of the next n lines describes one voter and\ncontains two integers ai and bi (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^5; 0 \u2264 bi \u2264 10^4) \u2014 number of the\ncandidate that voter is going to vote for and amount of money you need to pay\nhim to change his mind. You are the candidate 0 (so if a voter wants to vote\nfor you, ai is equal to zero, in which case bi will also be equal to zero).\nOutput Print one integer \u2014 smallest amount of money you need to spend to win\nthe elections. Examples Input 5 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 0 0 Output 3 Input 4 1 2 1 2 2\n1 0 0 Output 2 Input 1 100000 0 Output 0\n\n",
