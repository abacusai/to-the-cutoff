        "description": "The only difference between the easy and the hard version is the constraint on\n\n    n\n. You are given an undirected complete graph on \n    n\n vertices. A\ncomplete graph is a graph where each pair of vertices is connected by an edge.\nYou have to paint the edges of the graph into two colors, red and blue (each\nedge will have one color). A set of vertices \n    S\n is red-connected if, for\nevery pair of vertices \n    (v_1, v_2)\n such that \n    v_1 \n    \u2208 S\n and \n    v_2\n    \n    \u2208 S\n, there exists a path from \n    v_1\n to \n    v_2\n that goes only\nthrough red edges and vertices from \n    S\n. Similarly, a set of vertices\n\n    S\n is blue-connected if, for every pair of vertices \n    (v_1, v_2)\n such\nthat \n    v_1 \n    \u2208 S\n and \n    v_2 \n    \u2208 S\n, there exists a path from\n\n    v_1\n to \n    v_2\n that goes only through blue edges and vertices from\n\n    S\n. You have to paint the graph in such a way that: there is at least one\nred edge; there is at least one blue edge; for each set of vertices \n    S\n\nsuch that \n    |S| \n    \u2265 2\n, \n    S\n is either red-connected or blue-\nconnected, but not both. Calculate the number of ways to paint the graph, and\nprint it modulo \n    998244353\n. Input The first (and only) line contains one\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^3\n). Output Print one\ninteger \u2014 the number of ways to paint the graph, taken modulo \n    998244353\n.\nExamples Input 3 Output 6 Input 4 Output 50 Input 100 Output 878752271 Input\n1337 Output 520628749\n\n",
