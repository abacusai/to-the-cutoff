        "description": "You are given a positive integer \n    n\n. Please find an array \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n that is perfect. A perfect array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n satisfies the following criteria: \n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 1000\n for all\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n. \n    a_i\n is divisible by \n    i\n for all \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    i \n    \u2264 n\n. \n    a_1 + a_2 + \n    \u2026 + a_n\n is divisible by \n    n\n. Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of\ntest cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 200\n). The description of the test\ncases follows. The only line of each test case contains a single positive\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the length of the array \n    a\n.\nOutput For each test case, output an array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n that\nis perfect. We can show that an answer always exists. If there are multiple\nsolutions, print any. Example Input 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Output 1 2 4 1 2 3 2 8 6 4\n3 4 9 4 5 1 10 18 8 5 36 3 6 21 24 10 6 14 Note In the third test case: \n    a_1\n    = 1\n is divisible by \n    1\n. \n    a_2 = 2\n is divisible by \n    2\n. \n    a_3\n    = 3\n is divisible by \n    3\n. \n    a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n is\ndivisible by \n    3\n. In the fifth test case: \n    a_1 = 3\n is divisible by\n\n    1\n. \n    a_2 = 4\n is divisible by \n    2\n. \n    a_3 = 9\n is divisible by\n\n    3\n. \n    a_4 = 4\n is divisible by \n    4\n. \n    a_5 = 5\n is divisible by\n\n    5\n. \n    a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 3 + 4 + 9 + 4 + 5 = 25\n is\ndivisible by \n    5\n.\n\n",
