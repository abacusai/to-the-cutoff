        "description": "You are given an n \u00d7 m grid, some of its nodes are black, the others are\nwhite. Moreover, it's not an ordinary grid \u2014 each unit square of the grid has\npainted diagonals. The figure below is an example of such grid of size 3 \u00d7 5.\nFour nodes of this grid are black, the other 11 nodes are white. Your task is\nto count the number of such triangles on the given grid that: the corners\nmatch the white nodes, and the area is positive; all sides go along the grid\nlines (horizontal, vertical or diagonal); no side contains black nodes. Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 400). Each of the\nfollowing n lines contain m characters (zeros and ones) \u2014 the description of\nthe grid. If the j-th character in the i-th line equals zero, then the node on\nthe i-th horizontal line and on the j-th vertical line is painted white.\nOtherwise, the node is painted black. The horizontal lines are numbered\nstarting from one from top to bottom, the vertical lines are numbered starting\nfrom one from left to right. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of\nrequired triangles. Examples Input 3 5 10000 10010 00001 Output 20 Input 2 2\n00 00 Output 4 Input 2 2 11 11 Output 0 Note The figure below shows red and\nblue triangles. They are the examples of the required triangles in the first\nsample. One of the invalid triangles is painted green. It is invalid because\nnot all sides go along the grid lines.\n\n",
