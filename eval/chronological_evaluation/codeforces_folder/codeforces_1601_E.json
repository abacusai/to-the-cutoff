        "description": "Students of one unknown college don't have PE courses. That's why \n    q\n of\nthem decided to visit a gym nearby by themselves. The gym is open for \n    n\n\ndays and has a ticket system. At the \n    i\n-th day, the cost of one ticket is\nequal to \n    a_i\n. You are free to buy more than one ticket per day. You can\nactivate a ticket purchased at day \n    i\n either at day \n    i\n or any day\nlater. Each activated ticket is valid only for \n    k\n days. In other words,\nif you activate ticket at day \n    t\n, it will be valid only at days \n    t, t +\n    1, \n    \u2026, t + k - 1\n. You know that the \n    j\n-th student wants to visit\nthe gym at each day from \n    l_j\n to \n    r_j\n inclusive. Each student will\nuse the following strategy of visiting the gym at any day \n    i\n (\n    l_j\n    \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 r_j\n): person comes to a desk selling tickets placed near the\nentrance and buy several tickets with cost \n    a_i\n apiece (possibly, zero\ntickets); if the person has at least one activated and still valid ticket,\nthey just go in. Otherwise, they activate one of tickets purchased today or\nearlier and go in. Note that each student will visit gym only starting\n\n    l_j\n, so each student has to buy at least one ticket at day \n    l_j\n.\nHelp students to calculate the minimum amount of money they have to spend in\norder to go to the gym. Input The first line contains three integers \n    n\n,\n\n    q\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, q \n    \u2264 300\n     000\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264\n    n\n) \u2014 the number of days, the number of students and the number of days each\nticket is still valid. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the cost of one ticket at the\ncorresponding day. Each of the next \n    q\n lines contains two integers\n\n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the segment of\ndays the corresponding student want to visit the gym. Output For each student,\nprint the minimum possible amount of money they have to spend in order to go\nto the gym at desired days. Example Input 7 5 2 2 15 6 3 7 5 6 1 2 3 7 5 5 7 7\n3 5 Output 2 12 7 6 9 Note Let's see how each student have to spend their\nmoney: The first student should buy one ticket at day \n    1\n. The second\nstudent should buy one ticket at day \n    3\n and two tickets at day \n    4\n.\nNote that student can keep purchased tickets for the next days. The third\nstudent should buy one ticket at day \n    5\n. The fourth student should buy\none ticket at day \n    7\n. The fifth student should buy one ticket at day\n\n    3\n and one at day \n    4\n.\n\n",
