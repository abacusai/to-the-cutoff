        "name": "DZY Loves Bridges",
        "description": "DZY owns 2^m islands near his home, numbered from 1 to 2^m. He loves building\nbridges to connect the islands. Every bridge he builds takes one day's time to\nwalk across. DZY has a strange rule of building the bridges. For every pair of\nislands u, v (u \u2260 v), he has built 2^k different bridges connecting them,\nwhere (a|b means b is divisible by a). These bridges are bidirectional. Also,\nDZY has built some bridges connecting his home with the islands. Specifically,\nthere are ai different bridges from his home to the i-th island. These are\none-way bridges, so after he leaves his home he will never come back. DZY\ndecides to go to the islands for sightseeing. At first he is at home. He\nchooses and walks across one of the bridges connecting with his home, and\narrives at some island. After that, he will spend t day(s) on the islands.\nEach day, he can choose to stay and rest, or to walk to another island across\nthe bridge. It is allowed to stay at an island for more than one day. It's\nalso allowed to cross one bridge more than once. Suppose that right after the\nt-th day DZY stands at the i-th island. Let ans[i] be the number of ways for\nDZY to reach the i-th island after t-th day. Your task is to calculate ans[i]\nfor each i modulo 1051131. Input To avoid huge input, we use the following way\nto generate the array a. You are given the first s elements of array: a1, a2,\n..., as. All the other elements should be calculated by formula: ai = (101\u00b7ai\n- s + 10007) mod 1051131 (s < i \u2264 2^m). The first line contains three integers\nm, t, s (1 \u2264 m \u2264 25; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^18; 1 \u2264 s \u2264 min(2^m, 10^5)). The second line\ncontains s integers a1, a2, ..., as (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^6). Output To avoid huge\noutput, you only need to output xor-sum of all the answers for all i modulo\n1051131 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 2^m), i.e. (ans[1] mod 1051131) xor (ans[2] mod 1051131)\nxor... xor (ans[n] mod 1051131). Examples Input 2 1 4 1 1 1 2 Output 1 Input 3\n5 6 389094 705719 547193 653800 947499 17024 Output 556970 Note In the first\nsample, ans = [6, 7, 6, 6]. If he wants to be at island 1 after one day, he\nhas 6 different ways: home \u2014> 1 -(stay)-> 1 home \u2014> 2 \u2014> 1 home \u2014> 3 \u2014> 1 home\n\u2014> 3 \u2014> 1 (note that there are two different bridges between 1 and 3) home \u2014>\n4 \u2014> 1 home \u2014> 4 \u2014> 1 (note that there are two different bridges from home to\n4) In the second sample, (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8) = (389094, 705719,\n547193, 653800, 947499, 17024, 416654, 861849), ans = [235771, 712729, 433182,\n745954, 139255, 935785, 620229, 644335].\n\n",
