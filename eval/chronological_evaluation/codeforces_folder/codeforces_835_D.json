        "description": "Palindromic characteristics of string s with length |s| is a sequence of |s|\nintegers, where k-th number is the total number of non-empty substrings of s\nwhich are k-palindromes. A string is 1-palindrome if and only if it reads the\nsame backward as forward. A string is k-palindrome (k > 1) if and only if: Its\nleft half equals to its right half. Its left and right halfs are non-empty (k\n- 1)-palindromes. The left half of string t is its prefix of length \u230a|t| / 2\u230b,\nand right half \u2014 the suffix of the same length. \u230a|t| / 2\u230b denotes the length\nof string t divided by 2, rounded down. Note that each substring is counted as\nmany times as it appears in the string. For example, in the string \"aaa\" the\nsubstring \"a\" appears 3 times. Input The first line contains the string s (1 \u2264\n|s| \u2264 5000) consisting of lowercase English letters. Output Print |s| integers\n\u2014 palindromic characteristics of string s. Examples Input abba Output 6 1 0 0\nInput abacaba Output 12 4 1 0 0 0 0 Note In the first example 1-palindromes\nare substring \u00aba\u00bb, \u00abb\u00bb, \u00abb\u00bb, \u00aba\u00bb, \u00abbb\u00bb, \u00ababba\u00bb, the substring \u00abbb\u00bb is\n2-palindrome. There are no 3- and 4-palindromes here.\n\n",
