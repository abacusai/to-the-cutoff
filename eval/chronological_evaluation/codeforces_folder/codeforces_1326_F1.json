        "description": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference is constraints on the\nnumber of wise men and the time limit. You can make hacks only if all versions\nof this task are solved. \n    n\n wise men live in a beautiful city. Some of\nthem know each other. For each of the \n    n!\n possible permutations \n    p_1,\n    p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n of the wise men, let's generate a binary string of\nlength \n    n-1\n: for each \n    1 \n    \u2264 i < n\n set \n    s_i=1\n if \n    p_i\n\nand \n    p_i+1\n know each other, and \n    s_i=0\n otherwise. For all possible\n\n    2^n-1\n binary strings, find the number of permutations that produce\nthis binary string. Input The first line of input contains one integer \n    n\n\n(\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 14)\n \u2014 the number of wise men in the city. The next\n\n    n\n lines contain a binary string of length \n    n\n each, such that the\n\n    j\n-th character of the \n    i\n-th string is equal to '1' if wise man\n\n    i\n knows wise man \n    j\n, and equals '0' otherwise. It is guaranteed\nthat if the \n    i\n-th man knows the \n    j\n-th man, then the \n    j\n-th man\nknows \n    i\n-th man and no man knows himself. Output Print \n    2^n-1\n\nspace-separated integers. For each \n    0 \n    \u2264 x < 2^n-1\n: Let's consider\na string \n    s\n of length \n    n-1\n, such that \n    s_i = \n    \u230a\n    x/2^i-1\n    \u230b\n     2\n for all \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n -\n    1\n. The \n    (x+1)\n-th number should be equal to the required answer for\n\n    s\n. Examples Input 3 011 101 110 Output 0 0 0 6 Input 4 0101 1000 0001\n1010 Output 2 2 6 2 2 6 2 2 Note In the first test, each wise man knows each\nother, so every permutation will produce the string \n    11\n. In the second\ntest: If \n    p = \n    \n    1, 2, 3, 4\n, the produced string is \n    101\n,\nbecause wise men \n    1\n and \n    2\n know each other, \n    2\n and \n    3\n\ndon't know each other, and \n    3\n and \n    4\n know each other; If \n    p =\n    \n    \n    4, 1, 2, 3\n, the produced string is \n    110\n, because wise men\n\n    1\n and \n    4\n know each other, \n    1\n and \n    2\n know each other and\n\n    2\n, and \n    3\n don't know each other; If \n    p = \n    \n    1, 3, 2, 4\n,\nthe produced string is \n    000\n, because wise men \n    1\n and \n    3\n don't\nknow each other, \n    3\n and \n    2\n don't know each other, and \n    2\n and\n\n    4\n don't know each other.\n\n",
