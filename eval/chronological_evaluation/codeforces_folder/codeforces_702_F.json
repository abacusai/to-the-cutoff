        "description": "The big consignment of t-shirts goes on sale in the shop before the beginning\nof the spring. In all n types of t-shirts go on sale. The t-shirt of the i-th\ntype has two integer parameters \u2014 ci and qi, where ci \u2014 is the price of the\ni-th type t-shirt, qi \u2014 is the quality of the i-th type t-shirt. It should be\nassumed that the unlimited number of t-shirts of each type goes on sale in the\nshop, but in general the quality is not concerned with the price. As\npredicted, k customers will come to the shop within the next month, the j-th\ncustomer will get ready to spend up to bj on buying t-shirts. All customers\nhave the same strategy. First of all, the customer wants to buy the maximum\npossible number of the highest quality t-shirts, then to buy the maximum\npossible number of the highest quality t-shirts from residuary t-shirts and so\non. At the same time among several same quality t-shirts the customer will buy\none that is cheaper. The customers don't like the same t-shirts, so each\ncustomer will not buy more than one t-shirt of one type. Determine the number\nof t-shirts which each customer will buy, if they use the described strategy.\nAll customers act independently from each other, and the purchase of one does\nnot affect the purchase of another. Input The first line contains the positive\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of t-shirt types. Each of the\nfollowing n lines contains two integers ci and qi (1 \u2264 ci, qi \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the\nprice and the quality of the i-th type t-shirt. The next line contains the\npositive integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of the customers. The next\nline contains k positive integers b1, b2, ..., bk (1 \u2264 bj \u2264 10^9), where the\nj-th number is equal to the sum, which the j-th customer gets ready to spend\non t-shirts. Output The first line of the input data should contain the\nsequence of k integers, where the i-th number should be equal to the number of\nt-shirts, which the i-th customer will buy. Examples Input 3 7 5 3 5 4 3 2 13\n14 Output 2 3 Input 2 100 500 50 499 4 50 200 150 100 Output 1 2 2 1 Note In\nthe first example the first customer will buy the t-shirt of the second type,\nthen the t-shirt of the first type. He will spend 10 and will not be able to\nbuy the t-shirt of the third type because it costs 4, and the customer will\nowe only 3. The second customer will buy all three t-shirts (at first, the\nt-shirt of the second type, then the t-shirt of the first type, and then the\nt-shirt of the third type). He will spend all money on it.\n\n",
