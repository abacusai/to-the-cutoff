        "description": "Hideo Kojima has just quit his job at Konami. Now he is going to find a new\nplace to work. Despite being such a well-known person, he still needs a CV to\napply for a job. During all his career Hideo has produced n games. Some of\nthem were successful, some were not. Hideo wants to remove several of them\n(possibly zero) from his CV to make a better impression on employers. As a\nresult there should be no unsuccessful game which comes right after successful\none in his CV. More formally, you are given an array s1, s2, ..., sn of zeros\nand ones. Zero corresponds to an unsuccessful game, one \u2014 to a successful one.\nGames are given in order they were produced, and Hideo can't swap these\nvalues. He should remove some elements from this array in such a way that no\nzero comes right after one. Besides that, Hideo still wants to mention as much\ngames in his CV as possible. Help this genius of a man determine the maximum\nnumber of games he can leave in his CV. Input The first line contains one\ninteger number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). The second line contains n space-separated\ninteger numbers s1, s2, ..., sn (0 \u2264 si \u2264 1). 0 corresponds to an unsuccessful\ngame, 1 \u2014 to a successful one. Output Print one integer \u2014 the maximum number\nof games Hideo can leave in his CV so that no unsuccessful game comes after a\nsuccessful one. Examples Input 4 1 1 0 1 Output 3 Input 6 0 1 0 0 1 0 Output 4\nInput 1 0 Output 1\n\n",
