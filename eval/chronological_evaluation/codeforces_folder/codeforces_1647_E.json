        "name": "Madoka and the Sixth-graders",
        "description": "After the most stunning success with the fifth-graders, Madoka has been\ntrusted with teaching the sixth-graders. There's \n    n\n single-place desks in\nher classroom. At the very beginning Madoka decided that the student number\n\n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 n\n) will sit at the desk number \n    i\n.\nAlso there's an infinite line of students with numbers \n    n + 1, n + 2, n + 3,\n    \n    \u2026\n waiting at the door with the hope of being able to learn something\nfrom the Madoka herself. Pay attention that each student has his unique\nnumber. After each lesson, the following happens in sequence. The student\nsitting at the desk \n    i\n moves to the desk \n    p_i\n. All students move\nsimultaneously. If there is more than one student at a desk, the student with\nthe lowest number keeps the place, and the others are removed from the class\nforever. For all empty desks in ascending order, the student from the lowest\nnumber from the outside line occupies the desk. Note that in the end there is\nexactly one student at each desk again. It is guaranteed that the numbers\n\n    p\n are such that at least one student is removed after each lesson. Check\nout the explanation to the first example for a better understanding. After\nseveral (possibly, zero) lessons the desk \n    i\n is occupied by student\n\n    a_i\n. Given the values \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n and \n    p_1, p_2,\n    \n    \u2026, p_n\n, find the lexicographically smallest suitable initial seating\npermutation \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n. The permutation is an array of\n\n    n\n different integers from \n    1\n up to \n    n\n in any order. For\nexample, \n    [2,3,1,5,4]\n is a permutation, but \n    [1,2,2]\n is not (\n    2\n\noccurs twice). \n    [1,3,4]\n is not a permutation either (\n    n=3\n but\nthere's \n    4\n in the array). For two different permutations \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n of the same length, \n    a\n is lexicographically less than \n    b\n if\nin the first position where \n    a\n and \n    b\n differ, the permutation\n\n    a\n has a smaller element than the corresponding element in \n    b\n. Input\nThe first line of input data contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 a number of desks in the classroom. The second line contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\ndesks where the students move. It is guaranteed that \n    p\n has at least two\nequal elements. The third line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the final seating of the\nstudents. It is guaranteed that there is an initial permutation from which the\nseating \n    a\n can be obtained. Output In the only line print \n    n\n\nintegers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\nlexicographically minimum permutation describing the initial seating of the\nsixth-graders that can lead to the final seating \n    a\n. Examples Input 5 5 5\n3 3 1 1 8 2 9 4 Output 1 3 2 5 4 Input 5 1 3 2 5 2 3 2 5 4 1 Output 3 2 5 4 1\nInput 10 10 8 5 3 7 8 6 6 1 1 5 26 24 27 21 4 18 2 28 1 Output 5 4 2 6 7 8 3 9\n1 10 Note The description of the first test is below: The first picture shows\nthe starting permutation, which is the answer. Then the students sitting at\ndesks \n    1, 2\n are transferred to a \n    5\n desk. Also, a \n    1\n student\nmoved from a \n    5\n desk, and a student from a \n    4\n disk is transferred to\na \n    3\n desk. Thus, after all these transfers permutation shown in the\nsecond image is obtained. Then, at the desk with the number \n    5\n, the\nstudent with the number \n    3\n is expelled, and at the desk with the number\n\n    3\n, the student with the number \n    5\n is expelled. (Since their numbers\nare not the smallest) Then new students with numbers \n    6, 7\n sit at desks\nnumbered \n    2, 4\n. And this permutation (after the end of the first lesson)\nis shown in the third image. The \n    4\n image shows the seating arrangement,\nafter the second lesson before all the extra ones were kicked out. And the\nfifth shows the final seating after \n    2\n lesson.\n\n",
