        "description": "There are \n    n\n equidistant antennas on a line, numbered from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n. Each antenna has a power rating, the power of the \n    i\n-th antenna\nis \n    p_i\n. The \n    i\n-th and the \n    j\n-th antenna can communicate\ndirectly if and only if their distance is at most the minimum of their powers,\ni.e., \n    |i-j| \n    \u2264\n    min(p_i, p_j)\n. Sending a message directly between\ntwo such antennas takes \n    1\n second. What is the minimum amount of time\nnecessary to send a message from antenna \n    a\n to antenna \n    b\n, possibly\nusing other antennas as relays? Input Each test contains multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. The descriptions of the \n    t\n test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    a\n,\n\n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 200\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of\nantennas, and the origin and target antenna. The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the\npowers of the antennas. The sum of the values of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    200\n     000\n. Output For each test case, print the number\nof seconds needed to trasmit a message from \n    a\n to \n    b\n. It can be\nshown that under the problem constraints, it is always possible to send such a\nmessage. Example Input 3 10 2 9 4 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 3 1 3 3 3 1 Output\n4 0 2 Note In the first test case, we must send a message from antenna \n    2\n\nto antenna \n    9\n. A sequence of communications requiring \n    4\n seconds,\nwhich is the minimum possible amount of time, is the following: In \n    1\n\nsecond we send the message from antenna \n    2\n to antenna \n    1\n. This is\npossible since \n    |2-1|\n    \u2264\n    min(1, 4) = \n    min(p_2, p_1)\n. In \n    1\n\nsecond we send the message from antenna \n    1\n to antenna \n    5\n. This is\npossible since \n    |1-5|\n    \u2264\n    min(4, 5) = \n    min(p_1, p_5)\n. In \n    1\n\nsecond we send the message from antenna \n    5\n to antenna \n    10\n. This is\npossible since \n    |5-10|\n    \u2264\n    min(5, 5) = \n    min(p_5, p_10)\n. In\n\n    1\n second we send the message from antenna \n    10\n to antenna \n    9\n.\nThis is possible since \n    |10-9|\n    \u2264\n    min(5, 1) = \n    min(p_10, p_9)\n.\n\n",
