        "description": "Imagine that you are in a building that has exactly n floors. You can move\nbetween the floors in a lift. Let's number the floors from bottom to top with\nintegers from 1 to n. Now you're on the floor number a. You are very bored, so\nyou want to take the lift. Floor number b has a secret lab, the entry is\nforbidden. However, you already are in the mood and decide to make k\nconsecutive trips in the lift. Let us suppose that at the moment you are on\nthe floor number x (initially, you were on floor a). For another trip between\nfloors you choose some floor with number y (y \u2260 x) and the lift travels to\nthis floor. As you cannot visit floor b with the secret lab, you decided that\nthe distance from the current floor x to the chosen y must be strictly less\nthan the distance from the current floor x to floor b with the secret lab.\nFormally, it means that the following inequation must fulfill: |x - y| < |x -\nb|. After the lift successfully transports you to floor y, you write down\nnumber y in your notepad. Your task is to find the number of distinct number\nsequences that you could have written in the notebook as the result of k trips\nin the lift. As the sought number of trips can be rather large, find the\nremainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Input The first\nline of the input contains four space-separated integers n, a, b, k (2 \u2264 n \u2264\n5000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 5000, 1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n, a \u2260 b). Output Print a single integer \u2014 the\nremainder after dividing the sought number of sequences by 1000000007 (10^9 +\n7). Examples Input 5 2 4 1 Output 2 Input 5 2 4 2 Output 2 Input 5 3 4 1\nOutput 0 Note Two sequences p1, p2, ..., pk and q1, q2, ..., qk are distinct,\nif there is such integer j (1 \u2264 j \u2264 k), that pj \u2260 qj. Notes to the samples: In\nthe first sample after the first trip you are either on floor 1, or on floor\n3, because |1 - 2| < |2 - 4| and |3 - 2| < |2 - 4|. In the second sample there\nare two possible sequences: (1, 2); (1, 3). You cannot choose floor 3 for the\nfirst trip because in this case no floor can be the floor for the second trip.\nIn the third sample there are no sought sequences, because you cannot choose\nthe floor for the first trip.\n\n",
