        "description": "Surely you have seen insane videos by South Korean rapper PSY, such as\n\"Gangnam Style\", \"Gentleman\" and \"Daddy\". You might also hear that PSY has\nbeen recording video \"Oppa Funcan Style\" two years ago (unfortunately we\ncouldn't find it on the internet). We will remind you what this hit looked\nlike (you can find original description here): On the ground there are \n    n\n\nplatforms, which are numbered with integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, on\n\n    i\n-th platform there is a dancer with number \n    i\n. Further, every\nsecond all the dancers standing on the platform with number \n    i\n jump to\nthe platform with the number \n    f(i)\n. The moving rule \n    f\n is selected\nin advance and is not changed throughout the clip. The duration of the clip\nwas \n    k\n seconds and the rule \n    f\n was chosen in such a way that after\n\n    k\n seconds all dancers were in their initial positions (i.e. the\n\n    i\n-th dancer stood on the platform with the number \n    i\n). That allowed\nto loop the clip and collect even more likes. PSY knows that enhanced versions\nof old artworks become more and more popular every day. So he decided to\nrelease a remastered-version of his video. In his case \"enhanced version\"\nmeans even more insanity, so the number of platforms can be up to\n\n    10^18\n! But the video director said that if some dancer stays on the\nsame platform all the time, then the viewer will get bored and will turn off\nthe video immediately. Therefore, for all \n    x\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n\n\n    f(x) \n    \u2260 x\n must hold. Big part of classic video's success was in that\nlooping, so in the remastered version all dancers should return to their\ninitial positions in the end of the clip as well. PSY hasn't decided on the\nexact number of platforms and video duration yet, so he asks you to check if\nthere is a good rule \n    f\n for different options. Input In the first line of\ninput there is one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number\nof options for \n    n\n and \n    k\n to check. In the next \n    t\n lines the\noptions are given: each option is described with two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^18\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^15\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of dancers and the duration in seconds. It is guaranteed that the\nnumber of different values of \n    k\n in one test is not greater than\n\n    50\n. Output Print \n    t\n lines. If the \n    i\n-th option of the video is\nfeasible, print \"YES\" (without quotes) in \n    i\n-th line, otherwise print\n\"NO\" (without quotes). Example Input 3 7 7 3 8 5 6 Output YES NO YES\n\n",
