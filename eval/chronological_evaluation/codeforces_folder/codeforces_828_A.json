If a group consist of one person, it is seated at a vacant\none-seater table. If there are none of them, it is seated at a vacant two-\nseater table. If there are none of them, it is seated at a two-seater table\noccupied by single person. If there are still none of them, the restaurant\ndenies service to this group. If a group consist of two people, it is seated\nat a vacant two-seater table. If there are none of them, the restaurant denies\nservice to this group. You are given a chronological order of groups coming.\nYou are to determine the total number of people the restaurant denies service\nto. Input The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5, 1\n\u2264 a, b \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of groups coming to the restaurant, the number\nof one-seater and the number of two-seater tables. The second line contains a\nsequence of integers t1, t2, ..., tn (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 2) \u2014 the description of clients\nin chronological order. If ti is equal to one, then the i-th group consists of\none person, otherwise the i-th group consists of two people. Output Print the\ntotal number of people the restaurant denies service to. Examples Input 4 1 2\n1 2 1 1 Output 0 Input 4 1 1 1 1 2 1 Output 2 Note In the first example the\nfirst group consists of one person, it is seated at a vacant one-seater table.\nThe next group occupies a whole two-seater table. The third group consists of\none person, it occupies one place at the remaining two-seater table. The\nfourth group consists of one person, he is seated at the remaining seat at the\ntwo-seater table. Thus, all clients are served. In the second example the\nfirst group consists of one person, it is seated at the vacant one-seater\ntable. The next group consists of one person, it occupies one place at the\ntwo-seater table. It's impossible to seat the next group of two people, so the\nrestaurant denies service to them. The fourth group consists of one person, he\nis seated at the remaining seat at the two-seater table. Thus, the restaurant\ndenies service to 2 clients.\n\n",
