        "description": "Bob got a job as a system administrator in X corporation. His first task was\nto connect n servers with the help of m two-way direct connection so that it\nbecomes possible to transmit data from one server to any other server via\nthese connections. Each direct connection has to link two different servers,\neach pair of servers should have at most one direct connection. Y corporation,\na business rival of X corporation, made Bob an offer that he couldn't refuse:\nBob was asked to connect the servers in such a way, that when server with\nindex v fails, the transmission of data between some other two servers becomes\nimpossible, i.e. the system stops being connected. Help Bob connect the\nservers. Input The first input line contains 3 space-separated integer numbers\nn, m, v (3 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 v \u2264 n), n \u2014 amount of servers, m \u2014\namount of direct connections, v \u2014 index of the server that fails and leads to\nthe failure of the whole system. Output If it is impossible to connect the\nservers in the required way, output -1. Otherwise output m lines with 2\nnumbers each \u2014 description of all the direct connections in the system. Each\ndirect connection is described by two numbers \u2014 indexes of two servers, linked\nby this direct connection. The servers are numbered from 1. If the answer is\nnot unique, output any. Examples Input 5 6 3 Output 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 1 3 3 5\nInput 6 100 1 Output -1\n\n",
