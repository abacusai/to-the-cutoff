        "description": "Timur has a stairway with \n    n\n steps. The \n    i\n-th step is \n    a_i\n\nmeters higher than its predecessor. The first step is \n    a_1\n meters higher\nthan the ground, and the ground starts at \n    0\n meters. The stairs for the\nfirst test case. Timur has \n    q\n questions, each denoted by an integer\n\n    k_1, \n    \u2026, k_q\n. For each question \n    k_i\n, you have to print the\nmaximum possible height Timur can achieve by climbing the steps if his legs\nare of length \n    k_i\n. Timur can only climb the \n    j\n-th step if his legs\nare of length at least \n    a_j\n. In other words, \n    k_i \n    \u2265 a_j\n for\neach step \n    j\n climbed. Note that you should answer each question\nindependently. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each\ntest case contains two integers \n    n, q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, q \n    \u2264\n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n) \u2014 the number of steps and the number of questions,\nrespectively. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the height of the steps. The third line of\neach test case contains \n    q\n integers (\n    0 \n    \u2264 k_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014\nthe numbers for each question. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n does\nnot exceed \n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n, and the sum of \n    q\n does not exceed\n\n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For each test case, output a single line containing\n\n    q\n integers, the answer for each question. Please note, that the answer\nfor some questions won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at\nleast 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for\nC++). Example Input 3 4 5 1 2 1 5 1 2 4 9 10 2 2 1 1 0 1 3 1 1000000000\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 Output 1 4 4 9 9 0 2 3000000000 Note Consider\nthe first test case, pictured in the statement. If Timur's legs have length\n\n    1\n, then he can only climb stair \n    1\n, so the highest he can reach is\n\n    1\n meter. If Timur's legs have length \n    2\n or \n    4\n, then he can\nonly climb stairs \n    1\n, \n    2\n, and \n    3\n, so the highest he can reach\nis \n    1+2+1=4\n meters. If Timur's legs have length \n    9\n or \n    10\n, then\nhe can climb the whole staircase, so the highest he can reach is\n\n    1+2+1+5=9\n meters. In the first question of the second test case, Timur\nhas no legs, so he cannot go up even a single step. :(\n\n",
