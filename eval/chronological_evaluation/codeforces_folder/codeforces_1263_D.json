        "description": "One unknown hacker wants to get the admin's password of AtForces testing\nsystem, to get problems from the next contest. To achieve that, he sneaked\ninto the administrator's office and stole a piece of paper with a list of\n\n    n\n passwords \u2014 strings, consists of small Latin letters. Hacker went home\nand started preparing to hack AtForces. He found that the system contains only\npasswords from the stolen list and that the system determines the equivalence\nof the passwords \n    a\n and \n    b\n as follows: two passwords \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n are equivalent if there is a letter, that exists in both \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n; two passwords \n    a\n and \n    b\n are equivalent if there is a\npassword \n    c\n from the list, which is equivalent to both \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n. If a password is set in the system and an equivalent one is applied\nto access the system, then the user is accessed into the system. For example,\nif the list contain passwords \"a\", \"b\", \"ab\", \"d\", then passwords \"a\", \"b\",\n\"ab\" are equivalent to each other, but the password \"d\" is not equivalent to\nany other password from list. In other words, if: admin's password is \"b\",\nthen you can access to system by using any of this passwords: \"a\", \"b\", \"ab\";\nadmin's password is \"d\", then you can access to system by using only \"d\". Only\none password from the list is the admin's password from the testing system.\nHelp hacker to calculate the minimal number of passwords, required to\nguaranteed access to the system. Keep in mind that the hacker does not know\nwhich password is set in the system. Input The first line contain integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 number of passwords in the\nlist. Next \n    n\n lines contains passwords from the list \u2013 non-empty strings\n\n    s_i\n, with length at most \n    50\n letters. Some of the passwords may be\nequal. It is guaranteed that the total length of all passwords does not exceed\n\n    10^6\n letters. All of them consist only of lowercase Latin letters.\nOutput In a single line print the minimal number of passwords, the use of\nwhich will allow guaranteed to access the system. Examples Input 4 a b ab d\nOutput 2 Input 3 ab bc abc Output 1 Input 1 codeforces Output 1 Note In the\nsecond example hacker need to use any of the passwords to access the system.\n\n",
