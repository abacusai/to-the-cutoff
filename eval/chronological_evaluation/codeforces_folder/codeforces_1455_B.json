        "description": "You are standing on the \n    \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc4b\n-axis at point \n    0\n and you want\nto move to an integer point \n    x > 0\n. You can make several jumps. Suppose\nyou're currently at point \n    y\n (\n    y\n may be negative) and jump for the\n\n    k\n-th time. You can: either jump to the point \n    y + k\n or jump to the\npoint \n    y - 1\n. What is the minimum number of jumps you need to reach the\npoint \n    x\n? Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first and only line of\neach test case contains the single integer \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264\n    10^6\n) \u2014 the destination point. Output For each test case, print the single\ninteger \u2014 the minimum number of jumps to reach \n    x\n. It can be proved that\nwe can reach any integer point \n    x\n. Example Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 1 3 2\n3 4 Note In the first test case \n    x = 1\n, so you need only one jump: the\n\n    1\n-st jump from \n    0\n to \n    0 + 1 = 1\n. In the second test case \n    x\n    = 2\n. You need at least three jumps: the \n    1\n-st jump from \n    0\n to\n\n    0 + 1 = 1\n; the \n    2\n-nd jump from \n    1\n to \n    1 + 2 = 3\n; the\n\n    3\n-rd jump from \n    3\n to \n    3 - 1 = 2\n; Two jumps are not enough\nbecause these are the only possible variants: the \n    1\n-st jump as \n    -1\n\nand the \n    2\n-nd one as \n    -1\n \u2014 you'll reach \n    0 -1 -1 =-2\n; the\n\n    1\n-st jump as \n    -1\n and the \n    2\n-nd one as \n    +2\n \u2014 you'll reach\n\n    0 -1 +2 = 1\n; the \n    1\n-st jump as \n    +1\n and the \n    2\n-nd one as\n\n    -1\n \u2014 you'll reach \n    0 +1 -1 = 0\n; the \n    1\n-st jump as \n    +1\n and\nthe \n    2\n-nd one as \n    +2\n \u2014 you'll reach \n    0 +1 +2 = 3\n; In the third\ntest case, you need two jumps: the \n    1\n-st one as \n    +1\n and the\n\n    2\n-nd one as \n    +2\n, so \n    0 + 1 + 2 = 3\n. In the fourth test case,\nyou need three jumps: the \n    1\n-st one as \n    -1\n, the \n    2\n-nd one as\n\n    +2\n and the \n    3\n-rd one as \n    +3\n, so \n    0 - 1 + 2 + 3 = 4\n.\n\n",
