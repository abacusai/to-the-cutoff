        "description": "There is an infinite board of square tiles. Initially all tiles are white.\nVova has a red marker and a blue marker. Red marker can color \n    a\n tiles.\nBlue marker can color \n    b\n tiles. If some tile isn't white then you can't\nuse marker of any color on it. Each marker must be drained completely, so at\nthe end there should be exactly \n    a\n red tiles and exactly \n    b\n blue\ntiles across the board. Vova wants to color such a set of tiles that: they\nwould form a rectangle, consisting of exactly \n    a+b\n colored tiles; all\ntiles of at least one color would also form a rectangle. Here are some\nexamples of correct colorings: Here are some examples of incorrect colorings:\nAmong all correct colorings Vova wants to choose the one with the minimal\nperimeter. What is the minimal perimeter Vova can obtain? It is guaranteed\nthat there exists at least one correct coloring. Input A single line contains\ntwo integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 10^14\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of tiles red marker should color and the number of tiles blue marker\nshould color, respectively. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the minimal\nperimeter of a colored rectangle Vova can obtain by coloring exactly \n    a\n\ntiles red and exactly \n    b\n tiles blue. It is guaranteed that there exists\nat least one correct coloring. Examples Input 4 4 Output 12 Input 3 9 Output\n14 Input 9 3 Output 14 Input 3 6 Output 12 Input 506 2708 Output 3218 Note The\nfirst four examples correspond to the first picture of the statement. Note\nthat for there exist multiple correct colorings for all of the examples. In\nthe first example you can also make a rectangle with sides \n    1\n and\n\n    8\n, though its perimeter will be \n    18\n which is greater than \n    8\n.\nIn the second example you can make the same resulting rectangle with sides\n\n    3\n and \n    4\n, but red tiles will form the rectangle with sides \n    1\n\nand \n    3\n and blue tiles will form the rectangle with sides \n    3\n and\n\n    3\n.\n\n",
