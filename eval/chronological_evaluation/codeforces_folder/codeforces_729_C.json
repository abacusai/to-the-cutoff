        "name": "Road to Cinema",
        "description": "Vasya is currently at a car rental service, and he wants to reach cinema. The\nfilm he has bought a ticket for starts in t minutes. There is a straight road\nof length s from the service to the cinema. Let's introduce a coordinate\nsystem so that the car rental service is at the point 0, and the cinema is at\nthe point s. There are k gas stations along the road, and at each of them you\ncan fill a car with any amount of fuel for free! Consider that this operation\ndoesn't take any time, i.e. is carried out instantly. There are n cars in the\nrental service, i-th of them is characterized with two integers ci and vi \u2014\nthe price of this car rent and the capacity of its fuel tank in liters. It's\nnot allowed to fuel a car with more fuel than its tank capacity vi. All cars\nare completely fueled at the car rental service. Each of the cars can be\ndriven in one of two speed modes: normal or accelerated. In the normal mode a\ncar covers 1 kilometer in 2 minutes, and consumes 1 liter of fuel. In the\naccelerated mode a car covers 1 kilometer in 1 minutes, but consumes 2 liters\nof fuel. The driving mode can be changed at any moment and any number of\ntimes. Your task is to choose a car with minimum price such that Vasya can\nreach the cinema before the show starts, i.e. not later than in t minutes.\nAssume that all cars are completely fueled initially. Input The first line\ncontains four positive integers n, k, s and t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 2\u00b710^5,\n2 \u2264 s \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 2\u00b710^9) \u2014 the number of cars at the car rental service,\nthe number of gas stations along the road, the length of the road and the time\nin which the film starts. Each of the next n lines contains two positive\nintegers ci and vi (1 \u2264 ci, vi \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the price of the i-th car and its\nfuel tank capacity. The next line contains k distinct integers g1, g2, ..., gk\n(1 \u2264 gi \u2264 s - 1) \u2014 the positions of the gas stations on the road in arbitrary\norder. Output Print the minimum rent price of an appropriate car, i.e. such\ncar that Vasya will be able to reach the cinema before the film starts (not\nlater than in t minutes). If there is no appropriate car, print -1. Examples\nInput 3 1 8 10 10 8 5 7 11 9 3 Output 10 Input 2 2 10 18 10 4 20 6 5 3 Output\n20 Note In the first sample, Vasya can reach the cinema in time using the\nfirst or the third cars, but it would be cheaper to choose the first one. Its\nprice is equal to 10, and the capacity of its fuel tank is 8. Then Vasya can\ndrive to the first gas station in the accelerated mode in 3 minutes, spending\n6 liters of fuel. After that he can full the tank and cover 2 kilometers in\nthe normal mode in 4 minutes, spending 2 liters of fuel. Finally, he drives in\nthe accelerated mode covering the remaining 3 kilometers in 3 minutes and\nspending 6 liters of fuel.\n\n",
