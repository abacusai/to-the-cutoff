        "description": "Sherlock met Moriarty for a final battle of wits. He gave him a regular n\nsided convex polygon. In addition to it, he gave him certain diagonals to form\nregions on the polygon. It was guaranteed that the diagonals did not intersect\nin interior points. He took each of the region and calculated its importance\nvalue. Importance value for a region formed by vertices a1, a2, ... , ax of\nthe polygon will be given by 2^a1 + 2^a2 + ... + 2^ax. Then, he sorted these\nregions on the basis of their importance value in ascending order. After that\nhe assigned each region an index from 1 to k, where k is the number of\nregions, and index of region is its position in the sorted array calculated\nabove. He wants Moriarty to color the regions using not more than 20 colors,\nsuch that two regions have same color only if all the simple paths between\nthese two regions have at least one region with color value less than the\ncolor value assigned to these regions. Simple path between two regions f and h\nis a sequence of regions r1, r2, ... rt such that r1 = f, rt = h, for each 1 \u2264\ni < t regions ri and ri + 1 share an edge, and ri = rj if and only if i = j.\nMoriarty couldn't answer and asks Sherlock to solve it himself. Help Sherlock\nin doing so. Input First line contains two integers n and m (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100000, 0\n\u2264 m \u2264 n - 3), the number of vertices in the polygon and the number of\ndiagonals added. Each of the next m lines contains two integers a and b (1 \u2264\na, b \u2264 n), describing a diagonal between vertices a and b. It is guaranteed\nthat the diagonals are correct, i. e. a and b don't coincide and are not\nneighboring. It is guaranteed that the diagonals do not intersect. Output Let\nthe number of regions be k. Output k space-separated integers, each between 1\nand 20, representing the colors of the regions in the order of increasing\nimportance. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. It can be shown\nthat at least one answer exists. Examples Input 4 1 1 3 Output 1 2 Input 6 3 1\n3 1 4 1 5 Output 2 1 2 3 Note In 2nd input, regions formed in order after\nsorting will be (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 5), (1, 5, 6), i.e, region (1, 2,\n3) is first region followed by region (1, 3, 4) and so on. So, we can color\nregions 1 and 3 with same color, as region number 2 is on the path from 1 to 3\nand it has color 1 which is less than color of 1 and 3, i.e., color number 2.\n\n",
