        "description": "A row of \n    n\n cells is given, all initially white. Using a stamp, you can\nstamp any two neighboring cells such that one becomes red and the other\nbecomes blue. A stamp can be rotated, i.e. it can be used in both ways: as\n\n    \n and as\n\n    \n. During use, the\nstamp must completely fit on the given \n    n\n cells (it cannot be partially\noutside the cells). The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell.\nEach usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp. For\nexample, one possible sequence of stamps to make the picture\n\n    \n\ncould be \n    \u2192\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u2192\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u2192\n.\nHere \n    \n, \n    \n, and\n\n    \n represent a white, red, or blue cell,\nrespectively, and the cells that the stamp is used on are marked with an\nunderline. Given a final picture, is it possible to make it using the stamp\nzero or more times? Input The first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each\ntest case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of the picture. The second line of each test case contains a string\n\n    s\n \u2014 the picture you need to make. It is guaranteed that the length of\n\n    s\n is \n    n\n and that \n    s\n only consists of the characters\n\n    \n, \n    \n, and \n    \n, representing a\nwhite, red, or blue cell, respectively. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output Output \n    t\n\nlines, each of which contains the answer to the corresponding test case. As an\nanswer, output \"YES\" if it possible to make the picture using the stamp zero\nor more times, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for\nexample, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a\npositive answer). Example Input 12 5 BRBBW 1 B 2 WB 2 RW 3 BRB 3 RBB 7 WWWWWWW\n9 RBWBWRRBW 10 BRBRBRBRRB 12 BBBRWWRRRWBR 10 BRBRBRBRBW 5 RBWBW Output YES NO\nNO NO YES YES YES NO YES NO YES NO Note The first test case is explained in\nthe statement. For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not\npossible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\". For the fifth test\ncase, you can use the stamp as follows: \n    \u2192\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u2192\n.\nFor the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: \n    \u2192\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u2192\n.\nFor the seventh test case, you don't need to use the stamp at all.\n\n",
