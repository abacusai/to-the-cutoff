        "description": "Dima Vatrushin is a math teacher at school. He was sent on vacation for\n\n    n\n days for his good work. Dima has long dreamed of going to a ski\nresort, so he wants to allocate several consecutive days and go skiing. Since\nthe vacation requires careful preparation, he will only go for at least\n\n    k\n days. You are given an array \n    a\n containing the weather forecast\nat the resort. That is, on the \n    i\n-th day, the temperature will be\n\n    a_i\n degrees. Dima was born in Siberia, so he can go on vacation only if\nthe temperature does not rise above \n    q\n degrees throughout the vacation.\nUnfortunately, Dima was so absorbed in abstract algebra that he forgot how to\ncount. He asks you to help him and count the number of ways to choose vacation\ndates at the resort. Input The first line of the input contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then follow\nthe descriptions of the test cases. The first line of each test case contains\nthree integers \n    n\n, \n    k\n, \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the length\nof the array \n    a\n, the minimum number of days at the resort, and the\nmaximum comfortable temperature for Dima. The second line of each test case\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, a_3, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264\n    a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the temperature at the ski resort. The sum of all \n    n\n\nvalues over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output Output\n\n    t\n integers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case \u2014\nthe number of ways for Dima to choose vacation dates at the resort. Example\nInput 7 3 1 15 -5 0 -10 5 3 -33 8 12 9 0 5 4 3 12 12 12 10 15 4 1 -5 0 -1 2 5\n5 5 0 3 -1 4 -5 -3 1 1 5 5 6 1 3 0 3 -2 5 -4 -4 Output 6 0 1 0 0 1 9 Note In\nthe first test case of the example, Dima can go on any day, so the suitable\ndates for him are [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]. In the second and\nfourth test cases of the example, Dima cannot go on any day due to the high\ntemperature, so there are no suitable dates. In the third test case of the\nexample, Dima can only go on the dates [1, 2, 3].\n\n",
