        "description": "Your friend recently gave you some slimes for your birthday. You have n slimes\nall initially with value 1. You are going to play a game with these slimes.\nInitially, you put a single slime by itself in a row. Then, you will add the\nother n - 1 slimes one by one. When you add a slime, you place it at the right\nof all already placed slimes. Then, while the last two slimes in the row have\nthe same value v, you combine them together to create a slime with value v +\n1. You would like to see what the final state of the row is after you've added\nall n slimes. Please print the values of the slimes in the row from left to\nright. Input The first line of the input will contain a single integer, n (1 \u2264\nn \u2264 100 000). Output Output a single line with k integers, where k is the\nnumber of slimes in the row after you've finished the procedure described in\nthe problem statement. The i-th of these numbers should be the value of the\ni-th slime from the left. Examples Input 1 Output 1 Input 2 Output 2 Input 3\nOutput 2 1 Input 8 Output 4 Note In the first sample, we only have a single\nslime with value 1. The final state of the board is just a single slime with\nvalue 1. In the second sample, we perform the following steps: Initially we\nplace a single slime in a row by itself. Thus, row is initially 1. Then, we\nwill add another slime. The row is now 1 1. Since two rightmost slimes have\nthe same values, we should replace these slimes with one with value 2. Thus,\nthe final state of the board is 2. In the third sample, after adding the first\ntwo slimes, our row is 2. After adding one more slime, the row becomes 2 1. In\nthe last sample, the steps look as follows: 1 2 2 1 3 3 1 3 2 3 2 1 4\n\n",
