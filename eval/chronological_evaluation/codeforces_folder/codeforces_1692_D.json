        "description": "Victor has a 24-hour clock that shows the time in the format \"HH:MM\" (00\n\n    \u2264\n HH \n    \u2264\n 23, 00 \n    \u2264\n MM \n    \u2264\n 59). He looks at\nthe clock every \n    x\n minutes, and the clock is currently showing time\n\n    s\n. How many different palindromes will Victor see in total after looking\nat the clock every \n    x\n minutes, the first time being at time \n    s\n? For\nexample, if the clock starts out as 03:12 and Victor looks at the clock every\n\n    360\n minutes (i.e. every \n    6\n hours), then he will see the times\n03:12, 09:12, 15:12, 21:12, 03:12, and the times will continue to repeat. Here\nthe time 21:12 is the only palindrome he will ever see, so the answer is\n\n    1\n. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For\nexample, the times 12:21, 05:50, 11:11 are palindromes but 13:13, 22:10, 02:22\nare not. Input The first line of the input contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of each\ntest case follows. The only line of each test case contains a string \n    s\n\nof length \n    5\n with the format \"HH:MM\" where \"HH\" is from \"00\" to \"23\" and\n\"MM\" is from \"00\" to \"59\" (both \"HH\" and \"MM\" have exactly two digits) and an\ninteger \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 1440\n) \u2014 the number of minutes Victor\ntakes to look again at the clock. Output For each test case, output a single\ninteger \u2014 the number of different palindromes Victor will see if he looks at\nthe clock every \n    x\n minutes starting from time \n    s\n. Example Input 6\n03:12 360 00:00 1 13:22 2 15:15 10 11:11 1440 22:30 27 Output 1 16 10 0 1 1\nNote The first test case is explained in the statement.\n\n",
