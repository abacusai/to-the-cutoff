        "description": "In a kindergarten, the children are being divided into groups. The teacher put\nthe children in a line and associated each child with his or her integer\ncharisma value. Each child should go to exactly one group. Each group should\nbe a nonempty segment of consecutive children of a line. A group's sociability\nis the maximum difference of charisma of two children in the group (in\nparticular, if the group consists of one child, its sociability equals a\nzero). The teacher wants to divide the children into some number of groups in\nsuch way that the total sociability of the groups is maximum. Help him find\nthis value. Input The first line contains integer n \u2014 the number of children\nin the line (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6). The second line contains n integers ai \u2014 the\ncharisma of the i-th child ( - 10^9 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9). Output Print the maximum\npossible total sociability of all groups. Examples Input 5 1 2 3 1 2 Output 3\nInput 3 3 3 3 Output 0 Note In the first test sample one of the possible\nvariants of an division is following: the first three children form a group\nwith sociability 2, and the two remaining children form a group with\nsociability 1. In the second test sample any division leads to the same\nresult, the sociability will be equal to 0 in each group.\n\n",
