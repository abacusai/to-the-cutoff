        "description": "In a small but very proud high school it was decided to win ACM ICPC. This\ngoal requires to compose as many teams of three as possible, but since there\nwere only 6 students who wished to participate, the decision was to build\nexactly two teams. After practice competition, participant number i got a\nscore of ai. Team score is defined as sum of scores of its participants. High\nschool management is interested if it's possible to build two teams with equal\nscores. Your task is to answer that question. Input The single line contains\nsix integers a1, ..., a6 (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 1000) \u2014 scores of the participants Output\nPrint \"YES\" (quotes for clarity), if it is possible to build teams with equal\nscore, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can print each character either upper- or\nlowercase (\"YeS\" and \"yes\" are valid when the answer is \"YES\"). Examples Input\n1 3 2 1 2 1 Output YES Input 1 1 1 1 1 99 Output NO Note In the first sample,\nfirst team can be composed of 1st, 2nd and 6th participant, second \u2014 of 3rd,\n4th and 5th: team scores are 1 + 3 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. In the second sample,\nscore of participant number 6 is too high: his team score will be definitely\ngreater.\n\n",
