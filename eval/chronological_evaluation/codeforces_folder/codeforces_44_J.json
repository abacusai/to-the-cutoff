        "description": "There are many interesting tasks on domino tilings. For example, an\ninteresting fact is known. Let us take a standard chessboard (8 \u00d7 8) and cut\nexactly two squares out of it. It turns out that the resulting board can\nalways be tiled using dominoes 1 \u00d7 2, if the two cut out squares are of the\nsame color, otherwise it is impossible. Petya grew bored with dominoes, that's\nwhy he took a chessboard (not necessarily 8 \u00d7 8), cut some squares out of it\nand tries to tile it using triminoes. Triminoes are reactangles 1 \u00d7 3 (or 3 \u00d7\n1, because triminoes can be rotated freely), also the two extreme squares of a\ntrimino are necessarily white and the square in the middle is black. The\ntriminoes are allowed to put on the chessboard so that their squares matched\nthe colors of the uncut squares of the chessboard, and also the colors must\nmatch: the black squares must be matched with the black ones only and the\nwhite ones \u2014 with the white squares. The triminoes must not protrude above the\nchessboard or overlap each other. All the uncut squares of the board must be\ncovered with triminoes. Help Petya find out if it is possible to tile his\nboard using triminos in the described way and print one of the variants of\ntiling. Input The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000) \u2014\nthe board size. Next n lines contain m symbols each and represent the board\ndescription. If some position contains \".\", then the square in this position\nhas been cut out. Symbol \"w\" stands for a white square, \"b\" stands for a black\nsquare. It is guaranteed that through adding the cut squares can result in a\ncorrect chessboard (i.e. with alternating black and white squares), thought,\nperhaps, of a non-standard size. Output If at least one correct tiling exists,\nin the first line print \"YES\" (without quotes), and then \u2014 the tiling\ndescription. The description must contain n lines, m symbols in each. The cut\nout squares, as well as in the input data, are marked by \".\". To denote\ntriminoes symbols \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" can be used, and all the three squares of\neach trimino must be denoted by the same symbol. If two triminoes share a\nside, than they must be denoted by different symbols. Two triminoes not\nsharing a common side can be denoted by one and the same symbol (c.f. sample).\nIf there are multiple correct ways of tiling, it is allowed to print any. If\nit is impossible to tile the board using triminoes or the correct tiling, for\nwhich four symbols \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" would be enough, doesn't exist, print\n\"NO\" (without quotes) in the first line.
