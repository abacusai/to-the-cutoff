        "description": "This time around, Baby Ehab will play with permutations. He has \n    n\n cubes\narranged in a row, with numbers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n written on them. He'll\nmake exactly \n    j\n operations. In each operation, he'll pick up \n    2\n\ncubes and switch their positions. He's wondering: how many different sequences\nof cubes can I have at the end? Since Baby Ehab is a turbulent person, he\ndoesn't know how many operations he'll make, so he wants the answer for every\npossible \n    j\n between \n    1\n and \n    k\n. Input The only line contains\n\n    2\n integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k\n    \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the number of cubes Baby Ehab has, and the parameter \n    k\n\nfrom the statement. Output Print \n    k\n space-separated integers. The\n\n    i\n-th of them is the number of possible sequences you can end up with if\nyou do exactly \n    i\n operations. Since this number can be very large, print\nthe remainder when it's divided by \n    10^9+7\n. Examples Input 2 3 Output 1 1\n1 Input 3 2 Output 3 3 Input 4 2 Output 6 12 Note In the second example, there\nare \n    3\n sequences he can get after \n    1\n swap, because there are \n    3\n\npairs of cubes he can swap. Also, there are \n    3\n sequences he can get after\n\n    2\n swaps: \n    [1,2,3]\n, \n    [3,1,2]\n, \n    [2,3,1]\n.\n\n",
