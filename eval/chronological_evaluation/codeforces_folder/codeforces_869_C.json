With hands joined, go everywhere at a speed\nfaster than our thoughts! This time, the Fire Sisters \u2014 Karen and Tsukihi \u2014 is\nheading for somewhere they've never reached \u2014 water-surrounded islands! There\nare three clusters of islands, conveniently coloured red, blue and purple. The\nclusters consist of a, b and c distinct islands respectively. Bridges have\nbeen built between some (possibly all or none) of the islands. A bridge\nbidirectionally connects two different islands and has length 1. For any two\nislands of the same colour, either they shouldn't be reached from each other\nthrough bridges, or the shortest distance between them is at least 3,\napparently in order to prevent oddities from spreading quickly inside a\ncluster. The Fire Sisters are ready for the unknown, but they'd also like to\ntest your courage. And you're here to figure out the number of different ways\nto build all bridges under the constraints, and give the answer modulo 998 244\n353. Two ways are considered different if a pair of islands exist, such that\nthere's a bridge between them in one of them, but not in the other. Input The\nfirst and only line of input contains three space-separated integers a, b and\nc (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 5 000) \u2014 the number of islands in the red, blue and purple\nclusters, respectively. Output Output one line containing an integer \u2014 the\nnumber of different ways to build bridges, modulo 998 244 353. Examples Input\n1 1 1 Output 8 Input 1 2 2 Output 63 Input 1 3 5 Output 3264 Input 6 2 9\nOutput 813023575 Note In the first example, there are 3 bridges that can\npossibly be built, and no setup of bridges violates the restrictions. Thus the\nanswer is 2^3 = 8. In the second example, the upper two structures in the\nfigure below are instances of valid ones, while the lower two are invalid due\nto the blue and purple clusters, respectively.\n\n",
