        "name": "Love Song",
        "description": "Petya once wrote a sad love song and shared it to Vasya. The song is a string\nconsisting of lowercase English letters. Vasya made up \n    q\n questions about\nthis song. Each question is about a subsegment of the song starting from the\n\n    l\n-th letter to the \n    r\n-th letter. Vasya considers a substring made\nup from characters on this segment and repeats each letter in the subsegment\n\n    k\n times, where \n    k\n is the index of the corresponding letter in the\nalphabet. For example, if the question is about the substring \"abbcb\", then\nVasya repeats letter 'a' once, each of the letters 'b' twice, letter 'c\" three\ntimes, so that the resulting string is \"abbbbcccbb\", its length is \n    10\n.\nVasya is interested about the length of the resulting string. Help Petya find\nthe length of each string obtained by Vasya. Input The first line contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    q\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 100\n     000\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 q\n    \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) \u2014 the length of the song and the number of questions.\nThe second line contains one string \n    s\n \u2014 the song, consisting of \n    n\n\nlowercase letters of English letters. Vasya's questions are contained in the\nnext \n    q\n lines. Each line contains two integers \n    l\n and \n    r\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the bounds of the question. Output Print\n\n    q\n lines: for each question print the length of the string obtained by\nVasya. Examples Input 7 3 abacaba 1 3 2 5 1 7 Output 4 7 11 Input 7 4 abbabaa\n1 3 5 7 6 6 2 4 Output 5 4 1 5 Input 13 7 sonoshikumiwo 1 5 2 10 7 7 1 13 4 8\n2 5 3 9 Output 82 125 9 191 62 63 97 Note In the first example Vasya is\ninterested in three questions. In the first question Vasya considers the\nsubstring \"aba\", that transforms to \"abba\", so the answer is equal to \n    4\n.\nIn the second question Vasya considers \"baca\", that transforms to \"bbaccca\",\nso the answer is \n    7\n. In the third question Vasya considers the string\n\"abacaba\",that transforms to \"abbacccabba\" of length \n    11\n.\n\n",
