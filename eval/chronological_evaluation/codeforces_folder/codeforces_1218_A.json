        "description": "You are in charge of the BubbleReactor. It consists of \n    N\n BubbleCores\nconnected with \n    N\n lines of electrical wiring. Each electrical wiring\nconnects two distinct BubbleCores. There are no BubbleCores connected with\nmore than one line of electrical wiring. Your task is to start the\nBubbleReactor by starting each BubbleCore. In order for a BubbleCore to be\nstarted it needs to be receiving power from a directly connected BubbleCore\nwhich is already started. However, you can kick-start one BubbleCore manually\nwithout needing power. It is guaranteed that all BubbleCores can be started.\nBefore the BubbleCore boot up procedure its potential is calculated as the\nnumber of BubbleCores it can power on (the number of inactive BubbleCores\nwhich are connected to it directly or with any number of inactive BubbleCores\nin between, itself included) Start the BubbleReactor so that the sum of all\nBubbleCores' potentials is maximum. Input First line contains one integer \n    N\n    (3 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 15.000)\n, the number of BubbleCores. The following N\nlines contain two integers \n    U, V (0 \n    \u2264 U \n    \u2260 V < N)\n denoting that\nthere exists electrical wiring between BubbleCores \n    U\n and \n    V\n. Output\nSingle integer, the maximum sum of all BubbleCores' potentials. Example Input\n10 0 1 0 3 0 4 0 9 1 2 2 3 2 7 4 5 4 6 7 8 Output 51 Note If we start by\nkickstarting BubbleCup 8 and then turning on cores 7, 2, 1, 3, 0, 9, 4, 5, 6\nin that order we get potentials 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 51\n\n",
