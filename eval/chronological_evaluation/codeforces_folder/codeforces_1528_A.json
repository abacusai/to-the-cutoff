        "description": "Parsa has a humongous tree on \n    n\n vertices. On each vertex \n    v\n he has\nwritten two integers \n    l_v\n and \n    r_v\n. To make Parsa's tree look even\nmore majestic, Nima wants to assign a number \n    a_v\n (\n    l_v \n    \u2264 a_v \n    \u2264\n    r_v\n) to each vertex \n    v\n such that the beauty of Parsa's tree is\nmaximized. Nima's sense of the beauty is rather bizarre. He defines the beauty\nof the tree as the sum of \n    |a_u - a_v|\n over all edges \n    (u, v)\n of the\ntree. Since Parsa's tree is too large, Nima can't maximize its beauty on his\nown. Your task is to find the maximum possible beauty for Parsa's tree. Input\nThe first line contains an integer \n    t\n \n    (1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 250)\n \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first\nline of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n \n    (2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264\n    10^5)\n \u2014 the number of vertices in Parsa's tree. The \n    i\n-th of the\nfollowing \n    n\n lines contains two integers \n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n \n    (1\n    \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 10^9)\n. Each of the next \n    n-1\n lines contains\ntwo integers \n    u\n and \n    v\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 u , v \n    \u2264 n, u\n    \u2260 v)\n\nmeaning that there is an edge between the vertices \n    u\n and \n    v\n in\nParsa's tree. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed \n    2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case print the maximum possible beauty\nfor Parsa's tree.

In the second test case,\none of the possible assignments is \n    a = \n    \n    1, 5, 9\n which results\nin a beauty of \n    |1 - 5| + |5 - 9| = 8\n\n\n",
