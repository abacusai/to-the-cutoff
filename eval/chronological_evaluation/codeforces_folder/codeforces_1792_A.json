        "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. He's going to kill \n    n\n monsters, the\n\n    i\n-th of them has \n    h_i\n health. Monocarp's character has two spells,\neither of which he can cast an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero) and\nin an arbitrary order: choose exactly two alive monsters and decrease their\nhealth by \n    1\n; choose a single monster and kill it. When a monster's\nhealth becomes \n    0\n, it dies. What's the minimum number of spell casts\nMonocarp should perform in order to kill all monsters? Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntestcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of monsters. The second line contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    h_1, h_2, \n    \u2026, h_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 h_i \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014\nthe health of each monster. The sum of \n    n\n over all testcases doesn't\nexceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n. Output For each testcase, print a single integer\n\u2014 the minimum number of spell casts Monocarp should perform in order to kill\nall monsters.

In the second testcase, the initial health\nlist is \n    [2, 4, 2]\n.

In the third testcase,\nthe initial health list is \n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n. Five spells are casted. The\n\n    i\n-th of them kills the \n    i\n-th monster with the second spell.
