        "description": "A robot is standing at the origin of the infinite two-dimensional plane. Each\nsecond the robot moves exactly \n    1\n meter in one of the four cardinal\ndirections: north, south, west, and east. For the first step the robot can\nchoose any of the four directions, but then at the end of every second it has\nto turn 90 degrees left or right with respect to the direction it just moved\nin. For example, if the robot has just moved north or south, the next step it\ntakes has to be either west or east, and vice versa. The robot makes exactly\n\n    n\n steps from its starting position according to the rules above. How\nmany different points can the robot arrive to at the end? The final\norientation of the robot can be ignored. Input The only line contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of steps the robot\nmakes. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of different possible\nlocations after exactly \n    n\n steps. Examples Input 1 Output 4 Input 2\nOutput 4 Input 3 Output 12 Note In the first sample case, the robot will end\nup 1 meter north, south, west, or east depending on its initial direction. In\nthe second sample case, the robot will always end up \n    \u221a(2)\n meters\nnorth-west, north-east, south-west, or south-east.\n\n",
