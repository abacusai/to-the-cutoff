        "name": "A and B and Interesting Substrings",
        "description": "A and B are preparing themselves for programming contests. After several years\nof doing sports programming and solving many problems that require calculating\nall sorts of abstract objects, A and B also developed rather peculiar tastes.\nA likes lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. He has assigned to each\nletter a number that shows how much he likes that letter (he has assigned\nnegative numbers to the letters he dislikes). B likes substrings. He\nespecially likes the ones that start and end with the same letter (their\nlength must exceed one). Also, A and B have a string s. Now they are trying to\nfind out how many substrings t of a string s are interesting to B (that is, t\nstarts and ends with the same letter and its length is larger than one), and\nalso the sum of values of all letters (assigned by A), except for the first\nand the last one is equal to zero. Naturally, A and B have quickly found the\nnumber of substrings t that are interesting to them. Can you do it? Input The\nfirst line contains 26 integers xa, xb, ..., xz ( - 10^5 \u2264 xi \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the\nvalue assigned to letters a, b, c, ..., z respectively. The second line\ncontains string s of length between 1 and 10^5 characters, consisting of\nLating lowercase letters\u2014 the string for which you need to calculate the\nanswer. Output Print the answer to the problem. Examples Input 1 1 -1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 xabcab Output 2 Input 1 1 -1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 7 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 aaa Output 2 Note In the first sample test\nstrings satisfying the condition above are abca and bcab. In the second sample\ntest strings satisfying the condition above are two occurences of aa.\n\n",
