        "description": "After learning some fancy algorithms about palindromes, Chouti found\npalindromes very interesting, so he wants to challenge you with this problem.\nChouti has got two strings \n    A\n and \n    B\n. Since he likes palindromes, he\nwould like to pick \n    a\n as some non-empty palindromic substring of \n    A\n\nand \n    b\n as some non-empty palindromic substring of \n    B\n. Concatenating\nthem, he will get string \n    ab\n. Chouti thinks strings he could get this way\nare interesting, so he wants to know how many different strings he can get.\nInput The first line contains a single string \n    A\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 |A| \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The second line contains a single string \n    B\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    |B| \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). Strings \n    A\n and \n    B\n contain only\nlowercase English letters. Output The first and only line should contain a\nsingle integer \u2014 the number of possible strings. Examples Input aa aba Output\n6 Input aaba abaa Output 15 Note In the first example, attainable strings are\n\"a\" + \"a\" = \"aa\", \"aa\" + \"a\" = \"aaa\", \"aa\" + \"aba\" = \"aaaba\", \"aa\" + \"b\" =\n\"aab\", \"a\" + \"aba\" = \"aaba\", \"a\" + \"b\" = \"ab\". In the second example,\nattainable strings are \"aa\", \"aaa\", \"aaaa\", \"aaaba\", \"aab\", \"aaba\", \"ab\",\n\"abaa\", \"abaaa\", \"abaaba\", \"abab\", \"ba\", \"baa\", \"baba\", \"bb\". Notice that\nthough \"a\"+\"aa\"=\"aa\"+\"a\"=\"aaa\", \"aaa\" will only be counted once.\n\n",
