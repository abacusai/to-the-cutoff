        "description": "There are r red and g green blocks for construction of the red-green tower.\nRed-green tower can be built following next rules: Red-green tower is\nconsisting of some number of levels; Let the red-green tower consist of n\nlevels, then the first level of this tower should consist of n blocks, second\nlevel \u2014 of n - 1 blocks, the third one \u2014 of n - 2 blocks, and so on \u2014 the last\nlevel of such tower should consist of the one block. In other words, each\nsuccessive level should contain one block less than the previous one; Each\nlevel of the red-green tower should contain blocks of the same color. Let h be\nthe maximum possible number of levels of red-green tower, that can be built\nout of r red and g green blocks meeting the rules above. The task is to\ndetermine how many different red-green towers having h levels can be built out\nof the available blocks. Two red-green towers are considered different if\nthere exists some level, that consists of red blocks in the one tower and\nconsists of green blocks in the other tower. You are to write a program that\nwill find the number of different red-green towers of height h modulo 10^9 +\n7. Input The only line of input contains two integers r and g, separated by a\nsingle space \u2014 the number of available red and green blocks respectively (0 \u2264\nr, g \u2264 2\u00b710^5, r + g \u2265 1). Output Output the only integer \u2014 the number of\ndifferent possible red-green towers of height h modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples\nInput 4 6 Output 2 Input 9 7 Output 6 Input 1 1 Output 2 Note The image in the\nproblem statement shows all possible red-green towers for the first sample.\n\n",
