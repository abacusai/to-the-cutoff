        "description": "Iahub and Iahubina went to a date at a luxury restaurant. Everything went fine\nuntil paying for the food. Instead of money, the waiter wants Iahub to write a\nHungry sequence consisting of n integers. A sequence a1, a2, ..., an,\nconsisting of n integers, is Hungry if and only if: Its elements are in\nincreasing order. That is an inequality ai < aj holds for any two indices i, j\n(i < j). For any two indices i and j (i < j), aj must not be divisible by ai.\nIahub is in trouble, so he asks you for help. Find a Hungry sequence with n\nelements. Input The input contains a single integer: n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). Output\nOutput a line that contains n space-separated integers a1 a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai\n\u2264 10^7), representing a possible Hungry sequence. Note, that each ai must not\nbe greater than 10000000 (10^7) and less than 1. If there are multiple\nsolutions you can output any one. Examples Input 3 Output 2 9 15 Input 5\nOutput 11 14 20 27 31\n\n",
