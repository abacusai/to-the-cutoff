        "description": "A ticket is a string consisting of six digits. A ticket is considered lucky if\nthe sum of the first three digits is equal to the sum of the last three\ndigits. Given a ticket, output if it is lucky or not. Note that a ticket can\nhave leading zeroes. Input The first line of the input contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. The\ndescription of each test consists of one line containing one string consisting\nof six digits. Output Output \n    t\n lines, each of which contains the answer\nto the corresponding test case. Output \"YES\" if the given ticket is lucky, and\n\"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the\nstrings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive\nanswer). Example Input 5 213132 973894 045207 000000 055776 Output YES NO YES\nYES NO Note In the first test case, the sum of the first three digits is \n    2\n    + 1 + 3 = 6\n and the sum of the last three digits is \n    1 + 3 + 2 = 6\n,\nthey are equal so the answer is \"YES\". In the second test case, the sum of the\nfirst three digits is \n    9 + 7 + 3 = 19\n and the sum of the last three\ndigits is \n    8 + 9 + 4 = 21\n, they are not equal so the answer is \"NO\". In\nthe third test case, the sum of the first three digits is \n    0 + 4 + 5 = 9\n\nand the sum of the last three digits is \n    2 + 0 + 7 = 9\n, they are equal so\nthe answer is \"YES\".\n\n",
