        "description": "During her tantrums the princess usually smashes some collectable porcelain.\nEvery furious shriek is accompanied with one item smashed. The collection of\nporcelain is arranged neatly on n shelves. Within each shelf the items are\nplaced in one row, so that one can access only the outermost items \u2014 the\nleftmost or the rightmost item, not the ones in the middle of the shelf. Once\nan item is taken, the next item on that side of the shelf can be accessed (see\nexample). Once an item is taken, it can't be returned to the shelves. You are\ngiven the values of all items. Your task is to find the maximal damage the\nprincess' tantrum of m shrieks can inflict on the collection of porcelain.\nInput The first line of input data contains two integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) and m\n(1 \u2264 m \u2264 10000). The next n lines contain the values of the items on the\nshelves: the first number gives the number of items on this shelf (an integer\nbetween 1 and 100, inclusive), followed by the values of the items (integers\nbetween 1 and 100, inclusive), in the order in which they appear on the shelf\n(the first number corresponds to the leftmost item, the last one \u2014 to the\nrightmost one). The total number of items is guaranteed to be at least m.\nOutput Output the maximal total value of a tantrum of m shrieks. Examples\nInput 2 3 3 3 7 2 3 4 1 5 Output 15 Input 1 3 4 4 3 1 2 Output 9 Note In the\nfirst case there are two shelves, each with three items. To maximize the total\nvalue of the items chosen, one can take two items from the left side of the\nfirst shelf and one item from the right side of the second shelf. In the\nsecond case there is only one shelf, so all three items are taken from it \u2014\ntwo from the left side and one from the right side.\n\n",
