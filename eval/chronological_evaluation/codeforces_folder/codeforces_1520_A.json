        "description": "Polycarp has \n    26\n tasks. Each task is designated by a capital letter of\nthe Latin alphabet. The teacher asked Polycarp to solve tasks in the following\nway: if Polycarp began to solve some task, then he must solve it to the end,\nwithout being distracted by another task. After switching to another task,\nPolycarp cannot return to the previous task. Polycarp can only solve one task\nduring the day. Every day he wrote down what task he solved. Now the teacher\nwants to know if Polycarp followed his advice. For example, if Polycarp solved\ntasks in the following order: \"DDBBCCCBBEZ\", then the teacher will see that on\nthe third day Polycarp began to solve the task 'B', then on the fifth day he\ngot distracted and began to solve the task 'C', on the eighth day Polycarp\nreturned to the task 'B'. Other examples of when the teacher is suspicious:\n\"BAB\", \"AABBCCDDEEBZZ\" and \"AAAAZAAAAA\". If Polycarp solved the tasks as\nfollows: \"FFGZZZY\", then the teacher cannot have any suspicions. Please note\nthat Polycarp is not obligated to solve all tasks. Other examples of when the\nteacher doesn't have any suspicious: \"BA\", \"AFFFCC\" and \"YYYYY\". Help Polycarp\nfind out if his teacher might be suspicious. Input The first line contains an\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n). Then \n    t\n test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the number of days during which Polycarp solved tasks. The\nsecond line contains a string of length \n    n\n, consisting of uppercase Latin\nletters, which is the order in which Polycarp solved the tasks. Output For\neach test case output: \"YES\", if the teacher cannot be suspicious; \"NO\",\notherwise. You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example,\nthe strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES are all recognized as positive answer).\nExample Input 5 3 ABA 11 DDBBCCCBBEZ 7 FFGZZZY 1 Z 2 AB Output NO NO YES YES\nYES\n\n",
