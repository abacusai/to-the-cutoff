        "description": "Burenka has two pictures \n    a\n and \n    b\n, which are tables of the same\nsize \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n. Each cell of each painting has a color \u2014 a number\nfrom \n    0\n to \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, and there are no repeating colors in any\nrow or column of each of the two paintings, except color \n    0\n. Burenka\nwants to get a picture \n    b\n from the picture \n    a\n. To achieve her goal,\nBurenka can perform one of \n    2\n operations: swap any two rows of \n    a\n or\nany two of its columns. Tell Burenka if she can fulfill what she wants, and if\nso, tell her the sequence of actions. The rows are numbered from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n from top to bottom, the columns are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    m\n\nfrom left to right. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u00b7 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the sizes of the\ntable. The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    n\n lines contains \n    m\n integers\n\n    a_i, 1, a_i, 2, \n    \u2026, a_i, m\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i,j\n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the colors of the \n    i\n-th row of picture \n    a\n. It is\nguaranteed that there are no identical colors in the same row or column,\nexcept color \n    0\n. The \n    i\n-th of the following \n    n\n lines contains\n\n    m\n integers \n    b_i, 1, b_i, 2, \n    \u2026, b_i, m\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264\n    b_i,j\n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the colors of the \n    i\n-th row of\npicture \n    b\n. It is guaranteed that there are no identical colors in the\nsame row or column, except color \n    0\n. Output In the first line print the\nnumber \n    -1\n if it is impossible to achieve what Burenka wants, otherwise\nprint the number of actions in your solution \n    k\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). It can be proved that if a solution exists, then there\nexists a solution where \n    k \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. In the next \n    k\n\nlines print the operations. First print the type of the operation (\n    1\n \u2014\nswap rows, \n    2\n \u2014 columns), and then print the two indices of rows or\ncolumns to which the operation is applied. Note that you don't have to\nminimize the number of operations.
