        "description": "Today the \u00abZ\u00bb city residents enjoy a shell game competition. The residents are\ngathered on the main square to watch the breath-taking performance. The\nperformer puts 3 non-transparent cups upside down in a row. Then he openly\nputs a small ball under one of the cups and starts to shuffle the cups around\nvery quickly so that on the whole he makes exactly 3 shuffles. After that the\nspectators have exactly one attempt to guess in which cup they think the ball\nis and if the answer is correct they get a prize. Maybe you can try to find\nthe ball too? Input The first input line contains an integer from 1 to 3 \u2014\nindex of the cup which covers the ball before the shuffles. The following\nthree lines describe the shuffles. Each description of a shuffle contains two\ndistinct integers from 1 to 3 \u2014 indexes of the cups which the performer\nshuffled this time. The cups are numbered from left to right and are\nrenumbered after each shuffle from left to right again. In other words, the\ncup on the left always has index 1, the one in the middle \u2014 index 2 and the\none on the right \u2014 index 3. Output In the first line output an integer from 1\nto 3 \u2014 index of the cup which will have the ball after all the shuffles.\nExamples Input 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 Output 2 Input 1 2 1 3 1 1 3 Output 2\n\n",
