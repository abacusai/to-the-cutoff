        "description": "There are n walruses sitting in a circle. All of them are numbered in the\nclockwise order: the walrus number 2 sits to the left of the walrus number 1,\nthe walrus number 3 sits to the left of the walrus number 2, ..., the walrus\nnumber 1 sits to the left of the walrus number n. The presenter has m chips.\nThe presenter stands in the middle of the circle and starts giving the chips\nto the walruses starting from walrus number 1 and moving clockwise. The walrus\nnumber i gets i chips. If the presenter can't give the current walrus the\nrequired number of chips, then the presenter takes the remaining chips and the\nprocess ends. Determine by the given n and m how many chips the presenter will\nget in the end. Input The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n50, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of walruses and the number of chips\ncorrespondingly. Output Print the number of chips the presenter ended up with.\nExamples Input 4 11 Output 0 Input 17 107 Output 2 Input 3 8 Output 1 Note In\nthe first sample the presenter gives one chip to the walrus number 1, two\nchips to the walrus number 2, three chips to the walrus number 3, four chips\nto the walrus number 4, then again one chip to the walrus number 1. After that\nthe presenter runs out of chips. He can't give anything to the walrus number 2\nand the process finishes. In the third sample the presenter gives one chip to\nthe walrus number 1, two chips to the walrus number 2, three chips to the\nwalrus number 3, then again one chip to the walrus number 1. The presenter has\none chip left and he can't give two chips to the walrus number 2, that's why\nthe presenter takes the last chip.\n\n",
