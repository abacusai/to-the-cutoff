        "description": "Ali Koochooloo is going to buy new clothes since we're reaching Noruz, the\nancient Persian festival and the beginning of new Persian year. When Ali\nentered a shop, he saw that the shopkeeper was a programmer and since there is\nno money in programming he had changed his career. The shopkeeper told Ali\nthat he can buy anything for free if he could answer a simple question in 10\nseconds. But to see the question Ali has to pay 3 tomans. Ali agreed instantly\nand the shopkeeper handed him a piece of paper containing the task. The task\nwas indeed very simple. It said: Let string A be ababababababab. Which non-\nempty substring of A is repeated the most times in it? Ali answered fast. He\nsaid the answer is a. But the shopkeeper said that Ali is wrong and asked him\nto read the rest of statement: If several substrings have the maximal repeat\ntime, then the substring with maximal length would be the answer, in case of a\ntie the alphabetically latest substring will be chosen. So the answer is ab.\nNow Ali wants us to solve this problem for different strings. We don't have a\ngreat advantage over Ali, we just have a computer and a weird language. Input\nThe single line consisting of a string A. It is non-empty, made of lower-case\nLatin letters and contains at most 30 characters. Output The single line\ncontains the answer. Examples Input abab Output ab Input abcd Output abcd\n\n",
