        "description": "Denote a cyclic sequence of size \n    n\n as an array \n    s\n such that\n\n    s_n\n is adjacent to \n    s_1\n. The segment \n    s[r, l]\n where \n    l <\n    r\n is the concatenation of \n    s[r, n]\n and \n    s[1, l]\n. You are given an\narray \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n integers. Define \n    b\n as the cyclic\nsequence obtained from concatenating \n    m\n copies of \n    a\n. Note that\n\n    b\n has size \n    n \n    \u00b7 m\n. You are given an integer \n    k\n where\n\n    k = 1\n or \n    k\n is a prime number. Find the number of different\nsegments in \n    b\n where the sum of elements in the segment is divisible by\n\n    k\n. Two segments are considered different if the set of indices of the\nsegments are different. For example, when \n    n = 3\n and \n    m = 2\n, the set\nof indices for segment \n    s[2, 5]\n is \n    2, 3, 4, 5\n, and for\nsegment \n    s[5, 2]\n is \n    5, 6, 1, 2\n. In particular, the\nsegments \n    s[1, 6], s[2,1], \n    \u2026, s[6, 5]\n are considered as the same\nsegment. Output the answer modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Input The first line\ncontains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m, k\n    \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    k = 1\n or \n    k\n is a prime number). The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). Output Output an integer denoting the\nnumber of different segments in \n    b\n where the sum of elements in the\nsegment is divisible by \n    k\n, modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Examples Input 5 1 5 1\n2 3 4 3 Output 4 Input 5 1 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 5 Input 5 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output\n125 Note In the first example, all valid segments are \n    [1,4]\n, \n    [2,\n    3]\n, \n    [3, 5]\n, and \n    [4, 2]\n. In the second example, one of the valid\nsegments is \n    [1, 5]\n.\n\n",
