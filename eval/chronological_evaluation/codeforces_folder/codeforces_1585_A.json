        "description": "Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes\nforgets to water it. You are given \n    n\n days from Petya's live and you have\nto determine what happened with his flower in the end. The flower grows as\nfollows: If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. If the\nflower is watered in the \n    i\n-th day, it grows by \n    1\n centimeter. If\nthe flower is watered in the \n    i\n-th and in the \n    (i-1)\n-th day (\n    i >\n    1\n), then it grows by \n    5\n centimeters instead of \n    1\n. If the flower\nis not watered in the \n    i\n-th day, it does not grow. At the beginning of\nthe \n    1\n-st day the flower is \n    1\n centimeter tall. What is its height\nafter \n    n\n days? Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first\nline contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n).\nDescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains the only integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n). The second\nline of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n\n(\n    a_i = 0\n or \n    a_i = 1\n). If \n    a_i = 1\n, the flower is watered in\nthe \n    i\n-th day, otherwise it is not watered. Output For each test case\nprint a single integer \n    k\n \u2014 the flower's height after \n    n\n days, or\n\n    -1\n, if the flower dies. Example Input 4 3 1 0 1 3 0 1 1 4 1 0 0 1 1 0\nOutput 3 7 -1 1\n\n",
