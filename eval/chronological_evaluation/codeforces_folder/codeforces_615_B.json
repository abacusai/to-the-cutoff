        "name": "Longtail Hedgehog",
        "description": "This Christmas Santa gave Masha a magic picture and a pencil. The picture\nconsists of n points connected by m segments (they might cross in any way,\nthat doesn't matter). No two segments connect the same pair of points, and no\nsegment connects the point to itself. Masha wants to color some segments in\norder paint a hedgehog. In Mashas mind every hedgehog consists of a tail and\nsome spines. She wants to paint the tail that satisfies the following\nconditions: Only segments already presented on the picture can be painted; The\ntail should be continuous, i.e. consists of some sequence of points, such that\nevery two neighbouring points are connected by a colored segment; The numbers\nof points from the beginning of the tail to the end should strictly increase.\nMasha defines the length of the tail as the number of points in it. Also, she\nwants to paint some spines. To do so, Masha will paint all the segments, such\nthat one of their ends is the endpoint of the tail. Masha defines the beauty\nof a hedgehog as the length of the tail multiplied by the number of spines.\nMasha wants to color the most beautiful hedgehog. Help her calculate what\nresult she may hope to get. Note that according to Masha's definition of a\nhedgehog, one segment may simultaneously serve as a spine and a part of the\ntail (she is a little girl after all). Take a look at the picture for further\nclarifications. Input First line of the input contains two integers n and m(2\n\u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number of points and the number segments\non the picture respectively. Then follow m lines, each containing two integers\nui and vi (1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264 n, ui \u2260 vi) \u2014 the numbers of points connected by\ncorresponding segment. It's guaranteed that no two segments connect the same\npair of points. Output Print the maximum possible value of the hedgehog's\nbeauty. Examples Input 8 6 4 5 3 5 2 5 1 2 2 8 6 7 Output 9 Input 4 6 1 2 1 3\n1 4 2 3 2 4 3 4 Output 12 Note The picture below corresponds to the first\nsample. Segments that form the hedgehog are painted red. The tail consists of\na sequence of points with numbers 1, 2 and 5. The following segments are\nspines: (2, 5), (3, 5) and (4, 5). Therefore, the beauty of the hedgehog is\nequal to 3\u00b73 = 9.\n\n",
