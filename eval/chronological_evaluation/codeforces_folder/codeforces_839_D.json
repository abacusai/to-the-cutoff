        "description": "Winter is here at the North and the White Walkers are close. John Snow has an\narmy consisting of n soldiers. While the rest of the world is fighting for the\nIron Throne, he is going to get ready for the attack of the White Walkers. He\nhas created a method to know how strong his army is. Let the i-th soldier\u2019s\nstrength be ai. For some k he calls i1, i2, ..., ik a clan if i1 < i2 < i3 <\n... < ik and gcd(ai1, ai2, ..., aik) > 1 . He calls the strength of that clan\nk\u00b7gcd(ai1, ai2, ..., aik). Then he defines the strength of his army by the sum\nof strengths of all possible clans. Your task is to find the strength of his\narmy. As the number may be very large, you have to print it modulo 1000000007\n(10^9 + 7). Greatest common divisor (gcd) of a sequence of integers is the\nmaximum possible integer so that each element of the sequence is divisible by\nit. Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200000) \u2014 the size of the\narmy. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 1000000) \u2014\ndenoting the strengths of his soldiers. Output Print one integer \u2014 the\nstrength of John Snow's army modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Examples Input 3 3\n3 1 Output 12 Input 4 2 3 4 6 Output 39 Note In the first sample the clans are\n1, 2, 1, 2 so the answer will be 1\u00b73 + 1\u00b73 + 2\u00b73 = 12\n\n",
