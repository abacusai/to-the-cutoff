        "description": "Vupsen and Pupsen were gifted an integer array. Since Vupsen doesn't like the\nnumber \n    0\n, he threw away all numbers equal to \n    0\n from the array. As\na result, he got an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n. Pupsen, on the contrary,\nlikes the number \n    0\n and he got upset when he saw the array without\nzeroes. To cheer Pupsen up, Vupsen decided to come up with another array\n\n    b\n of length \n    n\n such that \n    \u2211_i=1^na_i \n    \u00b7 b_i=0\n.\nSince Vupsen doesn't like number \n    0\n, the array \n    b\n must not contain\nnumbers equal to \n    0\n. Also, the numbers in that array must not be huge, so\nthe sum of their absolute values cannot exceed \n    10^9\n. Please help Vupsen\nto find any such array \n    b\n! Input The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next \n    2\n    \n    \u00b7 t\n lines contain the description of test cases. The description of\neach test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of\nthe array. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n (\n    -10^4 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^4\n, \n    a_i \n    \u2260 0\n) \u2014 the elements\nof the array \n    a\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case print\n\n    n\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n \u2014 elements of the array \n    b\n\n(\n    |b_1|+|b_2|+\n    \u2026 +|b_n| \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    b_i \n    \u2260 0\n,\n\n    \u2211_i=1^na_i \n    \u00b7 b_i=0\n). It can be shown that the answer\nalways exists. Example Input 3 2 5 5 5 5 -2 10 -9 4 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Output 1\n-1 -1 5 1 -1 -1 -10 2 2 -3 5 -1 -1 Note In the first test case, \n    5 \n    \u00b7 1\n    + 5 \n    \u00b7 (-1)=5-5=0\n. You could also print \n    3\n \n    -3\n, for example,\nsince \n    5 \n    \u00b7 3 + 5 \n    \u00b7 (-3)=15-15=0\n In the second test case, \n    5\n    \n    \u00b7 (-1) + (-2) \n    \u00b7 5 + 10 \n    \u00b7 1 + (-9) \n    \u00b7 (-1) + 4 \n    \u00b7\n    (-1)=-5-10+10+9-4=0\n.\n\n",
