        "name": "Capture Valerian",
        "description": "It's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He\nis now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran. Recently\nthe Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the\nrecent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general,\nPhilip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the\nRoman emperor. Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top\nof one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors.\nFortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.\nEach door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part\nis either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The\nthird one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for\nwriting something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors,\nShapur found out the secret behind the locks. c is an integer written in base\na, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that\nthis R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman\nempire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake! Here's an\nexplanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:\nRoman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the\nletter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a\ncross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an\nabbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500\nM=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1,\n000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the\niteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same\nfor other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At\nthe fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with\nthe base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM\n900. Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. Help Shapur\ncapture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia. Input The\nfirst line contains two integers a and b (2 \u2264 a, b \u2264 25). Only b may be\nreplaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system. The next line\ncontains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading\nzeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. It is guaranteed that if we have\nRoman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and\nit won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\nOutput Write a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit\nleading zeros. Examples Input 10 2 1 Output 1 Input 16 R 5 Output V Input 5 R\n4 Output IV Input 2 2 1111001 Output 1111001 Input 12 13 A Output A Note You\ncan find more information about roman numerals here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\n",
