        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n that has a special condition:\nevery element in this array has at most 7 divisors. Find the length of the\nshortest non-empty subsequence of this array product of whose elements is a\nperfect square. A sequence \n    a\n is a subsequence of an array \n    b\n if\n\n    a\n can be obtained from \n    b\n by deletion of several (possibly, zero or\nall) elements. Input The first line contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of \n    a\n. The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n, \n    \u2026\n, \n    a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the elements of the array \n    a\n. Output Output the length\nof the shortest non-empty subsequence of \n    a\n product of whose elements is\na perfect square. If there are several shortest subsequences, you can find any\nof them. If there's no such subsequence, print \"-1\". Examples Input 3 1 4 6\nOutput 1 Input 4 2 3 6 6 Output 2 Input 3 6 15 10 Output 3 Input 4 2 3 5 7\nOutput -1 Note In the first sample, you can choose a subsequence \n    [1]\n. In\nthe second sample, you can choose a subsequence \n    [6, 6]\n. In the third\nsample, you can choose a subsequence \n    [6, 15, 10]\n. In the fourth sample,\nthere is no such subsequence.\n\n",
