        "description": "Alyona has built n towers by putting small cubes some on the top of others.\nEach cube has size 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1. A tower is a non-zero amount of cubes standing\non the top of each other. The towers are next to each other, forming a row.\nSometimes Alyona chooses some segment towers, and put on the top of each tower\nseveral cubes. Formally, Alyouna chooses some segment of towers from li to ri\nand adds di cubes on the top of them. Let the sequence a1, a2, ..., an be the\nheights of the towers from left to right. Let's call as a segment of towers\nal, al + 1, ..., ar a hill if the following condition holds: there is integer\nk (l \u2264 k \u2264 r) such that al < al + 1 < al + 2 < ... < ak > ak + 1 > ak + 2 >\n... > ar. After each addition of di cubes on the top of the towers from li to\nri, Alyona wants to know the maximum width among all hills. The width of a\nhill is the number of towers in it. Input The first line contain single\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of towers. The second line contain n\nintegers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of cubes in each tower.\nThe third line contain single integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of\nadditions. The next m lines contain 3 integers each. The i-th of these lines\ncontains integers li, ri and di (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 di \u2264 10^9), that mean that\nAlyona puts di cubes on the tio of each of the towers from li to ri. Output\nPrint m lines. In i-th line print the maximum width of the hills after the\ni-th addition. Example Input 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 1 3 2 2 2 1 4 4 1 Output 2 4 5 Note\nThe first sample is as follows: After addition of 2 cubes on the top of each\ntowers from the first to the third, the number of cubes in the towers become\nequal to [7, 7, 7, 5, 5]. The hill with maximum width is [7, 5], thus the\nmaximum width is 2. After addition of 1 cube on the second tower, the number\nof cubes in the towers become equal to [7, 8, 7, 5, 5]. The hill with maximum\nwidth is now [7, 8, 7, 5], thus the maximum width is 4. After addition of 1\ncube on the fourth tower, the number of cubes in the towers become equal to\n[7, 8, 7, 6, 5]. The hill with maximum width is now [7, 8, 7, 6, 5], thus the\nmaximum width is 5.\n\n",
