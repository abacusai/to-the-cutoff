        "description": "Due to the success of TWICE, JYP Entertainment has earned countless money and\nemerged as the biggest entertainment firm by market capitalization. Therefore,\nthe boss, JYP, has decided to create a new nation and has appointed you to\nprovide a design diagram. The new nation consists of \n    n\n cities and some\nroads between them. JYP has given some restrictions: To guarantee efficiency\nwhile avoiding chaos, for any \n    2\n different cities \n    A\n and \n    B\n,\nthere is exactly one road between them, and it is one-directional. There are\nno roads connecting a city to itself. The logo of rivaling companies should\nnot appear in the plan, that is, there does not exist \n    4\n distinct cities\n\n    A\n,\n    B\n,\n    C\n,\n    D\n , such that the following configuration\noccurs. JYP has given criteria for your diagram. For two cities\n\n    A\n,\n    B\n, let \n    dis(A,B)\n be the smallest number of roads you have\nto go through to get from \n    A\n to \n    B\n. If it is not possible to walk\nfrom \n    A\n to \n    B\n, \n    dis(A,B) = 614n\n. Then, the efficiency value is\ndefined to be the sum of \n    dis(A,B)\n for all ordered pairs of distinct\ncities \n    (A,B)\n. Note that \n    dis(A,B)\n doesn't have to be equal to\n\n    dis(B,A)\n. You have drawn a design diagram that satisfies JYP's\nrestrictions. Find the sum of \n    dis(A,B)\n over all ordered pairs of cities\n\n    (A,B)\n with \n    A\n    \u2260 B\n. Note that the input is given in compressed\nform. But even though it is compressed, you'd better use fast input. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    4 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 8000\n, \n    n\n    \n    \u2261 0 \n    4\n) \u2014 the number of cities. A binary matrix is encrypted\nin the following format. Each of \n    n\n next lines contains\n\n    n/4\n one-digit hexadecimal numbers (that is, these numbers can\nbe represented either as digits from \n    0\n to \n    9\n or as uppercase Latin\nletters from \n    A\n to \n    F\n). Binary representation of each of these\nnumbers denotes next \n    4\n elements of the matrix in the corresponding row.\nFor example, if the number \n    B\n is given, then the corresponding elements\nare \n    1011\n, and if the number is \n    5\n, then the corresponding elements\nare \n    0101\n. After you obtain the decrypted binary matrix, the \n    j\n-th\ncharacter of the \n    i\n-th row is \n    1\n if the one-directional road between\ncities \n    i\n and \n    j\n is directed from \n    i\n to \n    j\n, and \n    0\n\notherwise. It is guaranteed that the graph satisfies the restrictions\nmentioned above. Output Output one integer, representing the sum of\n\n    dis(A,B)\n over all ordered pairs of cities \n    (A,B)\n with \n    A\n    \u2260\n    B\n. Examples Input 4 7 2 1 4 Output 7380 Input 8 7F 3F 1F 0C 06 03 11 18\nOutput 88464 Note The first example corresponds to the matrix:\n\n    0111 \n    \n    \n     0010 \n    \n    \n     0001 \n    \n    \n     0100\n Which corresponds to this graph:\n\n    dis(1,2)=dis(1,3)=dis(1,4)=dis(2,3)=dis(3,4)=dis(4,2)=1\n\n\n    dis(2,4)=dis(4,3)=dis(3,2)=2\n \n    dis(2,1)=dis(3,1)=dis(4,1)=2456\n\nTherefore the answer for the diagram is \n    7380\n.\n\n",
