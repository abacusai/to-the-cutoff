        "description": "One day Sasha visited the farmer 2D and his famous magnetic farm. On this\nfarm, the crop grows due to the influence of a special magnetic field.\nMaintaining of the magnetic field is provided by \n    n\n machines, and the\npower of the \n    i\n-th machine is \n    a_i\n. This year 2D decided to\ncultivate a new culture, but what exactly he didn't say. For the successful\ngrowth of the new culture, it is necessary to slightly change the powers of\nthe machines. 2D can at most once choose an arbitrary integer \n    x\n, then\nchoose one machine and reduce the power of its machine by \n    x\n times, and\nat the same time increase the power of one another machine by \n    x\n times\n(powers of all the machines must stay positive integers). Note that he may not\ndo that if he wants. More formally, 2D can choose two such indices \n    i\n and\n\n    j\n, and one integer \n    x\n such that \n    x\n is a divisor of \n    a_i\n,\nand change powers as following: \n    a_i = \n    a_i/x\n, \n    a_j = a_j\n    \n    \u00b7 x\n Sasha is very curious, that's why he wants to calculate the\nminimum total power the farmer can reach. There are too many machines, and\nSasha can't cope with computations, help him! Input The first line contains\none integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\nmachines. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the powers of the machines. Output\nPrint one integer \u2014 minimum total power. Examples Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 14\nInput 4 4 2 4 4 Output 14 Input 5 2 4 2 3 7 Output 18 Note In the first\nexample, the farmer can reduce the power of the \n    4\n-th machine by \n    2\n\ntimes, and increase the power of the \n    1\n-st machine by \n    2\n times, then\nthe powers will be: \n    [2, 2, 3, 2, 5]\n. In the second example, the farmer\ncan reduce the power of the \n    3\n-rd machine by \n    2\n times, and increase\nthe power of the \n    2\n-nd machine by \n    2\n times. At the same time, the\nfarmer can leave is be as it is and the total power won't change. In the third\nexample, it is optimal to leave it be as it is.\n\n",
