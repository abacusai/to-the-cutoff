        "description": "Pak Chanek is given an array \n    a\n of \n    n\n integers. For each \n    i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n), Pak Chanek will write the one-element set\n\n    a_i\n on a whiteboard. After that, in one operation, Pak Chanek\nmay do the following: Choose two different sets \n    S\n and \n    T\n on the\nwhiteboard such that \n    S \n    \u2229 T = \n    \u2205\n (\n    S\n and \n    T\n do\nnot have any common elements). Erase \n    S\n and \n    T\n from the whiteboard\nand write \n    S \n    \u222a T\n (the union of \n    S\n and \n    T\n) onto the\nwhiteboard. After performing zero or more operations, Pak Chanek will\nconstruct a multiset \n    M\n containing the sizes of all sets written on the\nwhiteboard. In other words, each element in \n    M\n corresponds to the size of\na set after the operations. How many distinct\n    ^\n    \u2020\n multisets\n\n    M\n can be created by this process? Since the answer may be large, output\nit modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. \n    ^\n    \u2020\n Multisets \n    B\n and\n\n    C\n are different if and only if there exists a value \n    k\n such that\nthe number of elements with value \n    k\n in \n    B\n is different than the\nnumber of elements with value \n    k\n in \n    C\n. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2000\n). The second\nline contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 n\n). Output Output the number of distinct multisets \n    M\n modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Examples Input 6 1 1 2 1 4 3 Output 7 Input 7 3 5 4 3\n7 4 5 Output 11 Note In the first example, the possible multisets \n    M\n are\n\n    1,1,1,1,1,1\n, \n    1,1,1,1,2\n,\n\n    1,1,1,3\n, \n    1,1,2,2\n, \n    1,1,4\n,\n\n    1,2,3\n, and \n    2,2,2\n. As an example, let's\nconsider a possible sequence of operations. In the beginning, the sets are\n\n    1\n, \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    1\n,\n\n    4\n, and \n    3\n. Do an operation on sets\n\n    1\n and \n    3\n. Now, the sets are \n    1\n,\n\n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    4\n, and\n\n    1,3\n. Do an operation on sets \n    2\n and\n\n    4\n. Now, the sets are \n    1\n, \n    1\n,\n\n    1,3\n, and \n    2,4\n. Do an operation on sets\n\n    1,3\n and \n    2,4\n. Now, the sets are\n\n    1\n, \n    1\n, and \n    1,2,3,4\n. The\nmultiset \n    M\n that is constructed is \n    1,1,4\n.\n\n",
