        "description": "Given two integers \n    n\n and \n    x\n, a permutation\n    ^\n    \u2020\n\n\n    p\n of length \n    n\n is called funny if \n    p_i\n is a multiple of\n\n    i\n for all \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n - 1\n, \n    p_n = 1\n, and \n    p_1 =\n    x\n. Find the lexicographically minimal\n    ^\n funny permutation,\nor report that no such permutation exists. \n    ^\n    \u2020\n A permutation of\nlength \n    n\n is an array consisting of each of the integers from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n exactly once. \n    ^\n Let \n    a\n and \n    b\n be\npermutations of length \n    n\n. Then \n    a\n is lexicographically smaller than\n\n    b\n if in the first position \n    i\n where \n    a\n and \n    b\n differ,\n\n    a_i < b_i\n. A permutation is lexicographically minimal if it is\nlexicographically smaller than all other permutations. Input The input\nconsists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    x\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    1 < x \n    \u2264\n    n\n). The sum of \n    n\n across all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, if the answer exists, output \n    n\n\ndistinct integers \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\nthe lexicographically minimal funny permutation \n    p\n. Otherwise, output\n\n    -1\n. Example Input 3 3 3 4 2 5 4 Output 3 2 1 2 4 3 1 -1 Note In the\nfirst test case, the permutation \n    [3,2,1]\n satisfies all the conditions:\n\n    p_1=3\n, \n    p_3=1\n, and: \n    p_1=3\n is a multiple of \n    1\n.\n\n    p_2=2\n is a multiple of \n    2\n. In the second test case, the permutation\n\n    [2,4,3,1]\n satisfies all the conditions: \n    p_1=2\n, \n    p_4=1\n, and:\n\n    p_1=2\n is a multiple of \n    1\n. \n    p_2=4\n is a multiple of \n    2\n.\n\n    p_3=3\n is a multiple of \n    3\n. We can show that these permutations are\nlexicographically minimal. No such permutations exist in the third test case.\n\n",
