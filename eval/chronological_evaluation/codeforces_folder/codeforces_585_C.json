        "description": "Alice and Bob decided to eat some fruit. In the kitchen they found a large bag\nof oranges and apples. Alice immediately took an orange for herself, Bob took\nan apple. To make the process of sharing the remaining fruit more fun, the\nfriends decided to play a game. They put multiple cards and on each one they\nwrote a letter, either 'A', or the letter 'B'. Then they began to remove the\ncards one by one from left to right, every time they removed a card with the\nletter 'A', Alice gave Bob all the fruits she had at that moment and took out\nof the bag as many apples and as many oranges as she had before. Thus the\nnumber of oranges and apples Alice had, did not change. If the card had\nwritten letter 'B', then Bob did the same, that is, he gave Alice all the\nfruit that he had, and took from the bag the same set of fruit. After the last\ncard way removed, all the fruit in the bag were over. You know how many\noranges and apples was in the bag at first. Your task is to find any sequence\nof cards that Alice and Bob could have played with. Input The first line of\nthe input contains two integers, x, y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^18, xy > 1) \u2014 the number\nof oranges and apples that were initially in the bag. Output Print any\nsequence of cards that would meet the problem conditions as a compressed\nstring of characters 'A' and 'B. That means that you need to replace the\nsegments of identical consecutive characters by the number of repetitions of\nthe characters and the actual character. For example, string AAABAABBB should\nbe replaced by string 3A1B2A3B, but cannot be replaced by 2A1A1B2A3B or by\n3AB2A3B. See the samples for clarifications of the output format. The string\nthat you print should consist of at most 10^6 characters. It is guaranteed\nthat if the answer exists, its compressed representation exists, consisting of\nat most 10^6 characters. If there are several possible answers, you are\nallowed to print any of them. If the sequence of cards that meet the problem\nstatement does not not exist, print a single word Impossible. Examples Input 1\n4 Output 3B Input 2 2 Output Impossible Input 3 2 Output 1A1B Note In the\nfirst sample, if the row contained three cards with letter 'B', then Bob\nshould give one apple to Alice three times. So, in the end of the game Alice\nhas one orange and three apples, and Bob has one apple, in total it is one\norange and four apples. In second sample, there is no answer since one card is\nnot enough for game to finish, and two cards will produce at least three\napples or three oranges. In the third sample, cards contain letters 'AB', so\nafter removing the first card Bob has one orange and one apple, and after\nremoval of second card Alice has two oranges and one apple. So, in total it is\nthree oranges and two apples.\n\n",
