        "description": "You have a rooted tree consisting of n vertices. Let's number them with\nintegers from 1 to n inclusive. The root of the tree is the vertex 1. For each\ni > 1 direct parent of the vertex i is pi. We say that vertex i is child for\nits direct parent pi. You have initially painted all the vertices with red\ncolor. You like to repaint some vertices of the tree. To perform painting you\nuse the function paint that you call with the root of the tree as an argument.\nHere is the pseudocode of this function: count = 0 // global integer variable\nrnd()  // this function is used in paint code return 0 or 1 equiprobably \npaint(s)  if (count is even) then paint s with white color else paint s with\nblack color count = count + 1 if rnd() = 1 then children = [array of vertex s\nchildren in ascending order of their numbers] else children = [array of vertex\ns children in descending order of their numbers] for child in children  //\niterating over children array if rnd() = 1 then paint(child) // calling paint\nrecursively   As a result of this function, some vertices may change their\ncolors to white or black and some of them may remain red. Your task is to\ndetermine the number of distinct possible colorings of the vertices of the\ntree. We will assume that the coloring is possible if there is a nonzero\nprobability to get this coloring with a single call of paint(1). We assume\nthat the colorings are different if there is a pair of vertices that are\npainted with different colors in these colorings. Since the required number\nmay be very large, find its remainder of division by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).\nInput The first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number\nof vertexes in the tree. The second line contains n - 1 integers p2, p3, ...,\npn (1 \u2264 pi < i). Number pi is the parent of vertex i. Output Print a single\ninteger \u2014 the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7) Examples\nInput 4 1 2 1 Output 8 Input 3 1 1 Output 5 Note All possible coloring\npatterns of the first sample are given below.\n\n",
