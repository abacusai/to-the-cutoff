        "description": "Maxim loves sequences, especially those that strictly increase. He is\nwondering, what is the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the\ngiven sequence a? Sequence a is given as follows: the length of the sequence\nequals n \u00d7 t; (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u00d7 t), where operation means taking the remainder\nafter dividing number x by number y. Sequence s1, s2, ..., sr of length r is a\nsubsequence of sequence a1, a2, ..., an, if there is such increasing sequence\nof indexes i1, i2, ..., ir (1 \u2264 i1 < i2 < ... < ir \u2264 n), that aij = sj. In\nother words, the subsequence can be obtained from the sequence by crossing out\nsome elements. Sequence s1, s2, ..., sr is increasing, if the following\ninequality holds: s1 < s2 < ... < sr. Maxim have k variants of the sequence a.\nHelp Maxim to determine for each sequence the length of the longest increasing\nsubsequence. Input The first line contains four integers k, n, maxb and t (1 \u2264\nk \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 n, maxb \u2264 10^5; 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9; n \u00d7 maxb \u2264 2\u00b710^7). Each of the next\nk lines contain n integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 \u2264 bi \u2264 maxb). Note that for each\nvariant of the sequence a the values n, maxb and t coincide, the only arrays\nbs differ. The numbers in the lines are separated by single spaces. Output\nPrint k integers \u2014 the answers for the variants of the sequence a. Print the\nanswers in the order the variants follow in the input. Examples Input 3 3 5 2\n3 2 1 1 2 3 2 3 1 Output 2 3 3\n\n",
