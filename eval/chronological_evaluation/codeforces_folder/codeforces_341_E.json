        "description": "Iahub is playing an uncommon game. Initially, he has n boxes, numbered 1, 2,\n3, ..., n. Each box has some number of candies in it, described by a sequence\na1, a2, ..., an. The number ak represents the number of candies in box k. The\ngoal of the game is to move all candies into exactly two boxes. The rest of n\n- 2 boxes must contain zero candies. Iahub is allowed to do several (possible\nzero) moves. At each move he chooses two different boxes i and j, such that ai\n\u2264 aj. Then, Iahub moves from box j to box i exactly ai candies. Obviously,\nwhen two boxes have equal number of candies, box number j becomes empty. Your\ntask is to give him a set of moves such as Iahub to archive the goal of the\ngame. If Iahub can't win the game for the given configuration of boxes, output\n-1. Please note that in case there exist a solution, you don't need to print\nthe solution using minimal number of moves. Input The first line of the input\ncontains integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 1000). The next line contains n non-negative\nintegers: a1, a2, ..., an \u2014 sequence elements. It is guaranteed that sum of\nall numbers in sequence a is up to 10^6. Output In case there exists no\nsolution, output -1. Otherwise, in the first line output integer c (0 \u2264 c \u2264\n10^6), representing number of moves in your solution. Each of the next c lines\nshould contain two integers i and j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, i \u2260 j): integers i, j in\nthe kth line mean that at the k-th move you will move candies from the j-th\nbox to the i-th one. Examples Input 3 3 6 9 Output 2 2 3 1 3 Input 3 0 1 0\nOutput -1 Input 4 0 1 1 0 Output 0 Note For the first sample, after the first\nmove the boxes will contain 3, 12 and 3 candies. After the second move, the\nboxes will contain 6, 12 and 0 candies. Now all candies are in exactly 2\nboxes. For the second sample, you can observe that the given configuration is\nnot valid, as all candies are in a single box and they should be in two boxes.\nAlso, any move won't change the configuration, so there exists no solution.\nFor the third sample, all candies are already in 2 boxes. Hence, no move is\nneeded.\n\n",
