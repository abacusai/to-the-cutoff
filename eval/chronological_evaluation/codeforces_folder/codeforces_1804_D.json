        "description": "Annie is an amateur photographer. She likes to take pictures of giant\nresidential buildings at night. She just took a picture of a huge rectangular\nbuilding that can be seen as a table of \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n windows. That means\nthat the building has \n    n\n floors and each floor has exactly \n    m\n\nwindows. Each window is either dark or bright, meaning there is light turned\non in the room behind it. Annies knows that each apartment in this building is\neither one-bedroom or two-bedroom. Each one-bedroom apartment has exactly one\nwindow representing it on the picture, and each two-bedroom apartment has\nexactly two consecutive windows on the same floor. Moreover, the value of\n\n    m\n is guaranteed to be divisible by \n    4\n and it is known that each\nfloor has exactly \n    m/4\n two-bedroom apartments and exactly\n\n    m/2\n one-bedroom apartments. The actual layout of apartments is\nunknown and can be different for each floor. Annie considers an apartment to\nbe occupied if at least one of its windows is bright. She now wonders, what\nare the minimum and maximum possible number of occupied apartments if judged\nby the given picture? Formally, for each of the floors, she comes up with some\nparticular apartments layout with exactly \n    m/4\n two-bedroom\napartments (two consecutive windows) and \n    m/2\n one-bedroom\napartments (single window). She then counts the total number of apartments\nthat have at least one bright window. What is the minimum and maximum possible\nnumber she can get? Input The first line of the input contains two positive\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u00b7 m \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of floors in the building and the number of windows per\nfloor, respectively. It is guaranteed that \n    m\n is divisible by \n    4\n.\nThen follow \n    n\n lines containing \n    m\n characters each. The \n    j\n-th\ncharacter of the \n    i\n-th line is \"0\" if the \n    j\n-th window on the\n\n    i\n-th floor is dark, and is \"1\" if this window is bright. Output Print\ntwo integers, the minimum possible number of occupied apartments and the\nmaximum possible number of occupied apartments, assuming each floor can have\nan individual layout of \n    m/4\n two-bedroom and\n\n    m/2\n one-bedroom apartments. Examples Input 5 4 0100 1100 0110\n1010 1011 Output 7 10 Input 1 8 01011100 Output 3 4 Note In the first example,\neach floor consists of one two-bedroom apartment and two one-bedroom\napartments. The following apartment layout achieves the minimum possible\nnumber of occupied apartments equal to \n    7\n. |0 1|0|0| |1 1|0|0| |0|1 1|0|\n|1|0 1|0| |1|0|1 1| The following apartment layout achieves the maximum\npossible number of occupied apartments equal to \n    10\n. |0 1|0|0| |1|1 0|0|\n|0 1|1|0| |1|0 1|0| |1 0|1|1|\n\n",
