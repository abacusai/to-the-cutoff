        "description": "Polycarpus likes studying at school a lot and he is always diligent about his\nhomework. Polycarpus has never had any problems with natural sciences as his\ngreat-great-grandfather was the great physicist Seinstein. On the other hand\nthough, Polycarpus has never had an easy time with history. Everybody knows\nthat the World history encompasses exactly n events: the i-th event had\ncontinued from the year ai to the year bi inclusive (ai < bi). Polycarpus\neasily learned the dates when each of n events started and ended (Polycarpus\ninherited excellent memory from his great-great-granddad). But the teacher\ngave him a more complicated task: Polycaprus should know when all events began\nand ended and he should also find out for each event whether it includes\nanother event. Polycarpus' teacher thinks that an event j includes an event i\nif aj < ai and bi < bj. Your task is simpler: find the number of events that\nare included in some other event. Input The first input line contains integer\nn (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) which represents the number of events. Next n lines contain\ndescriptions of the historical events, one event per line. The i + 1 line\ncontains two integers ai and bi (1 \u2264 ai < bi \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the beginning and the\nend of the i-th event. No two events start or finish in the same year, that\nis, ai \u2260 aj, ai \u2260 bj, bi \u2260 aj, bi \u2260 bj for all i, j (where i \u2260 j). Events are\ngiven in arbitrary order. Output Print the only integer \u2014 the answer to the\nproblem. Examples Input 5 1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6 Output 4 Input 5 1 100 2 50 51\n99 52 98 10 60 Output 4 Input 1 1 1000000000 Output 0 Note In the first\nexample the fifth event is contained in the fourth. Similarly, the fourth\nevent is contained in the third, the third \u2014 in the second and the second \u2014 in\nthe first. In the second example all events except the first one are contained\nin the first. In the third example only one event, so the answer is 0.\n\n",
