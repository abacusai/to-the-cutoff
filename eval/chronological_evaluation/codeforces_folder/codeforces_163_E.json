        "description": "The best programmers of Embezzland compete to develop a part of the project\ncalled \"e-Government\" \u2014 the system of automated statistic collecting and press\nanalysis. We know that any of the k citizens can become a member of the\nEmbezzland government. The citizens' surnames are a1, a2, ..., ak. All\nsurnames are different. Initially all k citizens from this list are members of\nthe government. The system should support the following options: Include\ncitizen ai to the government. Exclude citizen ai from the government. Given a\nnewspaper article text, calculate how politicized it is. To do this, for every\nactive government member the system counts the number of times his surname\noccurs in the text as a substring. All occurrences are taken into\nconsideration, including the intersecting ones. The degree of politicization\nof a text is defined as the sum of these values for all active government\nmembers. Implement this system. Input The first line contains space-separated\nintegers n and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries to the system and\nthe number of potential government members. Next k lines contain the surnames\na1, a2, ..., ak, one per line. All surnames are pairwise different. Next n\nlines contain queries to the system, one per line. Each query consists of a\ncharacter that determines an operation and the operation argument, written\nconsecutively without a space. Operation \"include in the government\"\ncorresponds to the character \"+\", operation \"exclude\" corresponds to \"-\". An\nargument of those operations is an integer between 1 and k \u2014 the index of the\ncitizen involved in the operation. Any citizen can be included and excluded\nfrom the government an arbitrary number of times in any order. Including in\nthe government a citizen who is already there or excluding the citizen who\nisn't there changes nothing. The operation \"calculate politicization\"\ncorresponds to character \"?\". Its argument is a text. All strings \u2014 surnames\nand texts \u2014 are non-empty sequences of lowercase Latin letters. The total\nlength of all surnames doesn't exceed 10^6, the total length of all texts\ndoesn't exceed 10^6. Output For any \"calculate politicization\" operation print\non a separate line the degree of the politicization of the given text. Print\nnothing for other operations. Examples Input 7 3 a aa ab ?aaab -2 ?aaab -3\n?aaab +2 ?aabbaa Output 6 4 3 6\n\n",
