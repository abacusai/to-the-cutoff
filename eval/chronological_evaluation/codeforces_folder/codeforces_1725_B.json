        "description": "A basketball competition is held where the number of players in a team does\nnot have a maximum or minimum limit (not necessarily \n    5\n players in one\nteam for each match). There are \n    N\n candidate players in the competition\nthat will be trained by Pak Chanek, the best basketball coach on earth. The\n\n    i\n-th candidate player has a power of \n    P_i\n. Pak Chanek will form\nzero or more teams from the \n    N\n candidate players on the condition that\neach candidate player may only join in at most one team. Each of Pak Chanek's\nteams will be sent to compete once with an enemy team that has a power of\n\n    D\n. In each match, the team sent is said to defeat the enemy team if the\nsum of powers from the formed players is strictly greater than \n    D\n. One of\nPak Chanek's skills is that when a team that has been formed plays in a match,\nhe can change the power of each player in the team to be equal to the biggest\nplayer power from the team. Determine the maximum number of wins that can be\nachieved by Pak Chanek. Input The first line contains two integers \n    N\n and\n\n    D\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 D \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number\nof candidate players and the power of the enemy team. The second line contains\n\n    N\n integers \n    P_1, P_2, \n    \u2026, P_N\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 P_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n)\n\u2014 the powers of all candidate players. Output A line containing an integer\nrepresenting the maximum number of wins that can be achieved by Pak Chanek.\nExample Input 6 180 90 80 70 60 50 100 Output 2 Note The \n    1\n-st team\nformed is a team containing players \n    4\n and \n    6\n. The power of each\nplayer in the team becomes \n    100\n. So the total power of the team is \n    100\n    + 100 = 200 > 180\n. The \n    2\n-nd team formed is a team containing players\n\n    1\n, \n    2\n, and \n    5\n. The power of each player in the team becomes\n\n    90\n. So the total power of the team is \n    90 + 90 + 90 = 270 > 180\n.\n\n",
