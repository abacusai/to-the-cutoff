        "description": "Polycarp plays a computer game (yet again). In this game, he fights monsters\nusing magic spells. There are two types of spells: fire spell of power \n    x\n\ndeals \n    x\n damage to the monster, and lightning spell of power \n    y\n\ndeals \n    y\n damage to the monster and doubles the damage of the next spell\nPolycarp casts. Each spell can be cast only once per battle, but Polycarp can\ncast them in any order. For example, suppose that Polycarp knows three spells:\na fire spell of power \n    5\n, a lightning spell of power \n    1\n, and a\nlightning spell of power \n    8\n. There are \n    6\n ways to choose the order\nin which he casts the spells: first, second, third. This order deals \n    5 + 1\n    + 2 \n    \u00b7 8 = 22\n damage; first, third, second. This order deals \n    5 + 8\n    + 2 \n    \u00b7 1 = 15\n damage; second, first, third. This order deals \n    1 + 2\n    \n    \u00b7 5 + 8 = 19\n damage; second, third, first. This order deals \n    1 + 2\n    \n    \u00b7 8 + 2 \n    \u00b7 5 = 27\n damage; third, first, second. This order deals\n\n    8 + 2 \n    \u00b7 5 + 1 = 19\n damage; third, second, first. This order deals\n\n    8 + 2 \n    \u00b7 1 + 2 \n    \u00b7 5 = 20\n damage. Initially, Polycarp knows\n\n    0\n spells. His spell set changes \n    n\n times, each time he either\nlearns a new spell or forgets an already known one. After each change,\ncalculate the maximum possible damage Polycarp may deal using the spells he\nknows. Input The first line contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of changes to the spell set. Each of the next\n\n    n\n lines contains two integers \n    tp\n and \n    d\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 tp_i\n    \n    \u2264 1\n; \n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 d \n    \u2264 10^9\n; \n    d_i \n    \u2260 0\n) \u2014 the\ndescription of the change. If \n    tp_i\n if equal to \n    0\n, then Polycarp\nlearns (or forgets) a fire spell, otherwise he learns (or forgets) a lightning\nspell. If \n    d_i > 0\n, then Polycarp learns a spell of power \n    d_i\n.\nOtherwise, Polycarp forgets a spell with power \n    -d_i\n, and it is\nguaranteed that he knew that spell before the change. It is guaranteed that\nthe powers of all spells Polycarp knows after each change are different\n(Polycarp never knows two spells with the same power). Output After each\nchange, print the maximum damage Polycarp can deal with his current set of\nspells. Example Input 6 1 5 0 10 1 -5 0 5 1 11 0 -10 Output 5 25 10 15 36 21\n\n",
