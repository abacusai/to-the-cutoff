        "description": "The ship crashed into a reef and is sinking. Now the entire crew must be\nevacuated. All n crew members have already lined up in a row (for convenience\nlet's label them all from left to right with positive integers from 1 to n)\nand await further instructions. However, one should evacuate the crew\nproperly, in a strict order. Specifically: The first crew members to leave the\nship are rats. Then women and children (both groups have the same priority)\nleave the ship. After that all men are evacuated from the ship. The captain\nleaves the sinking ship last. If we cannot determine exactly who should leave\nthe ship first for any two members of the crew by the rules from the previous\nparagraph, then the one who stands to the left in the line leaves the ship\nfirst (or in other words, the one whose number in the line is less). For each\ncrew member we know his status as a crew member, and also his name. All crew\nmembers have different names. Determine the order in which to evacuate the\ncrew. Input The first line contains an integer n, which is the number of\npeople in the crew (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). Then follow n lines. The i-th of those lines\ncontains two words \u2014 the name of the crew member who is i-th in line, and his\nstatus on the ship. The words are separated by exactly one space. There are no\nother spaces in the line. The names consist of Latin letters, the first letter\nis uppercase, the rest are lowercase. The length of any name is from 1 to 10\ncharacters. The status can have the following values: rat for a rat, woman for\na woman, child for a child, man for a man, captain for the captain. The crew\ncontains exactly one captain. Output Print n lines. The i-th of them should\ncontain the name of the crew member who must be the i-th one to leave the\nship. Examples Input 6 Jack captain Alice woman Charlie man Teddy rat Bob\nchild Julia woman Output Teddy Alice Bob Julia Charlie Jack\n\n",
