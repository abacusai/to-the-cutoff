        "name": "Indecisive Taxi Fee",
        "description": "In the city of Capypaland where Kuro and Shiro resides, there are \n    n\n\ntowns numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n and there are \n    m\n bidirectional\nroads numbered from \n    1\n to \n    m\n connecting them. The \n    i\n-th road\nconnects towns \n    u_i\n and \n    v_i\n. Since traveling between the towns is\nquite difficult, the taxi industry is really popular here. To survive the\nharsh competition, each taxi company has to find a distinctive trait for their\ncustomers. Kuro is the owner of a taxi company. He has decided to introduce a\nnew fee model for his taxi brand, where the fee for each ride is not\ncalculated based on the trip length, but on the sum of the prices of the roads\ntraveled. The price for each of the \n    m\n roads has been decided by Kuro\nhimself. As of now, the price for the road \n    i\n is \n    w_i\n and hence the\nfee for a taxi ride traveling through roads \n    e_1, e_2, \n    \u2026, e_k\n is\n\n    \u2211_i=1^k w_e_i\n. However, Kuro himself is an indecisive person,\nso he has drafted \n    q\n plans to change the road price. Each of the plans\nwill be based on the original prices \n    w_i\n, except for a single road\n\n    t_j\n, the price of which is changed to \n    x_j\n. Note, that the plans\nare independent of each other. Shiro is a regular customer of the Kuro's taxi\nbrand since she uses the taxi to travel from town \n    1\n to town \n    n\n\nevery day. Since she's so a regular customer, Kuro decided to show her all his\n\n    q\n plans before publishing them to the public. Now, Shiro wants to know\nthe lowest fee she must pay to travel from the town \n    1\n to the town\n\n    n\n for each Kuro's plan. Input The first line contains three integers\n\n    n\n, \n    m\n and \n    q\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    m, q \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of towns, the number of roads, and\nthe number of plans that Kuro has drafted respectively. The \n    i\n-th of the\nnext \n    m\n contains three integers \n    u_i\n, \n    v_i\n and \n    w_i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 w_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    u_i \n     v_i\n)\n\u2014 two endpoints and the original price of the \n    i\n-th road. It is\nguaranteed, that there is at least one way to travel from town \n    1\n to town\n\n    n\n using these \n    m\n bidirectional roads. Each of the next \n    q\n\nlines contains two integers \n    t_j\n and \n    x_j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t_j \n    \u2264 m,\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_j \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the index of the road Kuro has planned to\nchange and its new price respectively. Output Print \n    q\n integers \u2014 the\nlowest fee Shiro must pay to get from town \n    1\n to town \n    n\n in each of\nthose \n    q\n plans. Examples Input 4 5 6 1 2 2 2 4 3 1 4 7 1 3 1 3 4 5 3 4 5\n1 3 8 1 4 2 1 3 1 Output 4 2 5 6 3 1 Input 2 4 4 1 2 2 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 2 5 2 1 3\n2 4 3 1 5 Output 1 2 2 3 Input 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 Output 3 Note In the first\nexample, the original overview of Capypaland looks like this, where the number\nnext to each road denotes the original prices of the roads, The overview of\nthe first plan, The lowest fee Shiro must pay in this plan is \n    4\n, which\ncorresponds to the path \n    1 \n    \u2192 4\n. The overview of the second\nplan, The lowest fee Shiro must pay in this plan is \n    2\n, which corresponds\nto the path \n    1 \n    \u2192 3 \n    \u2192 4\n. The overview of the third\nplan, The lowest fee Shiro must pay in this plan is \n    5\n, which corresponds\nto the path \n    1 \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 4\n.\n\n",
