        "description": "Given \n    n\n, find any array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n of integers such\nthat all of the following conditions hold: \n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n for\nevery \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. \n    a_1 < a_2 < \n    \u2026 <a_n\n For\nevery \n    i\n from \n    2\n to \n    n\n, \n    a_i\n isn't divisible by\n\n    a_i-1\n It can be shown that such an array always exists under the\nconstraints of the problem. Input The first line contains the number of test\ncases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n). Description of the test cases\nfollows. The only line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over\nall test cases does not exceed \n    10^4\n. Output For each test case print\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n \u2014 the array you found. If there\nare multiple arrays satisfying all the conditions, print any of them. Example\nInput 3 1 2 7 Output 1 2 3 111 1111 11111 111111 1111111 11111111 111111111\nNote In the first test case, array \n    [1]\n satisfies all the conditions. In\nthe second test case, array \n    [2, 3]\n satisfies all the conditions, as\n\n    2<3\n and \n    3\n is not divisible by \n    2\n. In the third test case,\narray \n    [111, 1111, 11111, 111111, 1111111, 11111111, 111111111]\n satisfies\nall the conditions, as it's increasing and \n    a_i\n isn't divisible by\n\n    a_i-1\n for any \n    i\n from \n    2\n to \n    7\n.\n\n",
