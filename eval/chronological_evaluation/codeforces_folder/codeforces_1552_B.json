        "description": "The Olympic Games have just started and Federico is eager to watch the\nmarathon race. There will be \n    n\n athletes, numbered from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n, competing in the marathon, and all of them have taken part in \n    5\n\nimportant marathons, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    5\n, in the past. For each\n\n    1\n    \u2264 i\n    \u2264 n\n and \n    1\n    \u2264 j\n    \u2264 5\n, Federico remembers that\nathlete \n    i\n ranked \n    r_i,j\n-th in marathon \n    j\n (e.g.,\n\n    r_2,4=3\n means that athlete \n    2\n was third in marathon \n    4\n).\nFederico considers athlete \n    x\n superior to athlete \n    y\n if athlete\n\n    x\n ranked better than athlete \n    y\n in at least \n    3\n past marathons,\ni.e., \n    r_x,j<r_y,j\n for at least \n    3\n distinct values of \n    j\n.\nFederico believes that an athlete is likely to get the gold medal at the\nOlympics if he is superior to all other athletes. Find any athlete who is\nlikely to get the gold medal (that is, an athlete who is superior to all other\nathletes), or determine that there is no such athlete. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of each test case\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 50\n     000\n) \u2014 the number\nof athletes. Then \n    n\n lines follow, each describing the ranking positions\nof one athlete. The \n    i\n-th of these lines contains the \n    5\n integers\n\n    r_i,1,\n     r_i,2,\n     r_i,3,\n     r_i,4,\n      r_i,5\n (\n    1\n    \u2264\n    r_i,j\n    \u2264 50\n     000\n) \u2014 the ranking positions of athlete \n    i\n in the\npast \n    5\n marathons. It is guaranteed that, in each of the \n    5\n past\nmarathons, the \n    n\n athletes have distinct ranking positions, i.e., for\neach \n    1\n    \u2264 j\n    \u2264 5\n, the \n    n\n values \n    r_1,j,\n      r_2, j,\n     \n    \u2026,\n      r_n, j\n are distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    50\n     000\n. Output For each\ntest case, print a single integer \u2014 the number of an athlete who is likely to\nget the gold medal (that is, an athlete who is superior to all other\nathletes). If there are no such athletes, print \n    -1\n. If there is more\nthan such one athlete, print any of them.

Explanation of the second\ntest case: There are \n    n=3\n athletes. Athlete \n    1\n is superior to\nathlete \n    2\n. Indeed athlete \n    1\n ranks better than athlete \n    2\n in\nthe marathons \n    1\n, \n    2\n and \n    3\n. Athlete \n    2\n is superior to\nathlete \n    3\n. Indeed athlete \n    2\n ranks better than athlete \n    3\n in\nthe marathons \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    4\n and \n    5\n. Athlete \n    3\n is\nsuperior to athlete \n    1\n. Indeed athlete \n    3\n ranks better than athlete\n\n    1\n in the marathons \n    3\n, \n    4\n and \n    5\n. Explanation of the\nthird test case: There are \n    n=3\n athletes. Athlete \n    1\n is superior to\nathletes \n    2\n and \n    3\n. Since he is superior to all other athletes, he\nis likely to get the gold medal. Athlete \n    2\n is superior to athlete\n\n    3\n. Athlete \n    3\n is not superior to any other athlete. Explanation of\nthe fourth test case: There are \n    n=6\n athletes. Athlete \n    1\n is\nsuperior to athletes \n    3\n, \n    4\n, \n    6\n. Athlete \n    2\n is superior to\nathletes \n    1\n, \n    4\n, \n    6\n. Athlete \n    3\n is superior to athletes\n\n    2\n, \n    4\n, \n    6\n. Athlete \n    4\n is not superior to any other\nathlete. Athlete \n    5\n is superior to athletes \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    3\n,\n\n    4\n, \n    6\n. Since he is superior to all other athletes, he is likely to\nget the gold medal. Athlete \n    6\n is only superior to athlete \n    4\n.\n\n",
