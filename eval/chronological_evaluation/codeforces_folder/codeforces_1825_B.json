        "description": "LuoTianyi gave an array \n    b\n of \n    n \n    \u00b7 m\n integers. She asks you to\nconstruct a table \n    a\n of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n, filled with these \n    n\n    \n    \u00b7 m\n numbers, and each element of the array must be used exactly once.\nAlso she asked you to maximize the following value:\n\n    \u2211\n    _i=1^n\n    \u2211\n    _j=1^m\n    (\n    max\n    _1\n    \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 i, 1 \n    \u2264 y \n    \u2264 ja_x,y-\n    min\n    _1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 i,\n    1 \n    \u2264 y \n    \u2264 ja_x,y\n    )\n This means that we consider \n    n \n    \u00b7\n    m\n subtables with the upper left corner in \n    (1,1)\n and the bottom right\ncorner in \n    (i, j)\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 j \n    \u2264 m\n), for\neach such subtable calculate the difference of the maximum and minimum\nelements in it, then sum up all these differences. You should maximize the\nresulting sum. Help her find the maximal possible value, you don't need to\nreconstruct the table itself. Input Each test consists of multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first\nline of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264\n    n, m \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of the table. The second\nline of each test case contains \n    n \n    \u00b7 m\n integers \n    b_1, b_2,\n    \n    \u2026, b_n\n    \u00b7 m\n (\n    -10^5 \n    \u2264 b_i\n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the numbers\nyou can put in the table. Note, that integers in the array \n    b\n can be\nnegative. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n \n    \u00b7 m\n over all test\ncases doesn't exceed \n    2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, output a\nsingle integer \u2014 the maximal value, that can be obtained. Example Input 5 2 2\n1 3 1 4 2 2 -1 -1 -1 -1 2 3 7 8 9 -3 10 8 3 2 4 8 -3 0 -7 1 4 3 -32030 59554\n16854 -85927 68060 -64460 -79547 90932 85063 82703 -12001 38762 Output 9 0 64\n71 1933711 Note In the first test case, the table is follows: 4113 In the\nsubtable with the bottom right corner in \n    (1, 1)\n, the difference of the\nmaximal and minimal elements is \n    4 - 4 = 0\n. In the subtable with the\nbottom right corner in \n    (1, 2)\n, the difference of the maximal and minimal\nelements is \n    4 - 1 = 3\n. In the subtable with the bottom right corner in\n\n    (2, 1)\n, the difference of the maximal and minimal elements is \n    4 - 1 =\n    3\n. In the subtable with the bottom right corner in \n    (2, 2)\n, the\ndifference of the maximal and minimal elements is \n    4 - 1 = 3\n. Then the\nmaximum possible value is \n    0+3+3+3=9\n. In the second test case, all\nelements are equal, so all differences are \n    0\n, and the answer is \n    0\n.\n\n",
