        "description": "Allen and Bessie are playing a simple number game. They both know a function\n\n    f: \n    \n    0, 1\n    \n    ^n \n    \u2192\n    \u211d\n, i. e. the function takes \n    n\n\nbinary arguments and returns a real value. At the start of the game, the\nvariables \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n\n are all set to \n    -1\n. Each round,\nwith equal probability, one of Allen or Bessie gets to make a move. A move\nconsists of picking an \n    i\n such that \n    x_i = -1\n and either setting\n\n    x_i \n    \u2192 0\n or \n    x_i \n    \u2192 1\n. After \n    n\n rounds all variables are\nset, and the game value resolves to \n    f(x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n)\n. Allen\nwants to maximize the game value, and Bessie wants to minimize it. Your goal\nis to help Allen and Bessie find the expected game value! They will play\n\n    r+1\n times though, so between each game, exactly one value of \n    f\n\nchanges. In other words, between rounds \n    i\n and \n    i+1\n for \n    1 \n    \u2264 i\n    \n    \u2264 r\n, \n    f(z_1, \n    \u2026, z_n) \n    \u2192 g_i\n for some \n    (z_1, \n    \u2026,\n    z_n) \n    \u2208\n    \n    0, 1\n    \n    ^n\n. You are to find the expected game value in the\nbeginning and after each change. Input The first line contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 18\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 2^18\n).\nThe next line contains \n    2^n\n integers \n    c_0, c_1, \n    \u2026, c_2^n-1\n\n(\n    0 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), denoting the initial values of \n    f\n. More\nspecifically, \n    f(x_0, x_1, \n    \u2026, x_n-1) = c_x\n, if \n    x =\n    \n    x_n-1\n    \u2026 x_0\n in binary. Each of the next \n    r\n lines\ncontains two integers \n    z\n and \n    g\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 z \n    \u2264 2^n - 1\n, \n    0\n    \n    \u2264 g \n    \u2264 10^9\n). If \n    z = \n    z_n-1\n    \u2026 z_0\n in\nbinary, then this means to set \n    f(z_0, \n    \u2026, z_n-1) \n    \u2192 g\n. Output\nPrint \n    r+1\n lines, the \n    i\n-th of which denotes the value of the game\n\n    f\n during the \n    i\n-th round. Your answer must have absolute or\nrelative error within \n    10^-6\n. Formally, let your answer be \n    a\n, and\nthe jury's answer be \n    b\n. Your answer is considered correct if\n\n    |a - b|/\n    max(1, |b|)\n    \u2264 10^-6\n. Examples Input 2 2 0 1\n2 3 2 5 0 4 Output 1.500000 2.250000 3.250000 Input 1 0 2 3 Output 2.500000\nInput 2 0 1 1 1 1 Output 1.000000 Note Consider the second test case. If Allen\ngoes first, he will set \n    x_1 \n    \u2192 1\n, so the final value will be \n    3\n.\nIf Bessie goes first, then she will set \n    x_1 \n    \u2192 0\n so the final value\nwill be \n    2\n. Thus the answer is \n    2.5\n. In the third test case, the\ngame value will always be \n    1\n regardless of Allen and Bessie's play.\n\n",
