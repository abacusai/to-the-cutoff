        "description": "Let's call a string balanced if all characters that are present in it appear\nthe same number of times. For example, \"coder\", \"appall\", and \"ttttttt\" are\nbalanced, while \"wowwow\" and \"codeforces\" are not. You are given a string\n\n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting of lowercase English letters. Find a\nbalanced string \n    t\n of the same length \n    n\n consisting of lowercase\nEnglish letters that is different from the string \n    s\n in as few positions\nas possible. In other words, the number of indices \n    i\n such that \n    s_i\n    \n     t_i\n should be as small as possible. Input Each test contains multiple\ntest cases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). The description of the test cases follows. Each test\ncase consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the string \n    s\n. The second\nline contains the string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting of lowercase\nEnglish letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print the smallest\nnumber of positions where string \n    s\n and a balanced string \n    t\n can\ndiffer, followed by such a string \n    t\n. If there are multiple solutions,\nprint any. It can be shown that at least one balanced string always exists.\nExample Input 4 5 hello 10 codeforces 5 eevee 6 appall Output 1 helno 2\ncodefofced 1 eeeee 0 appall Note In the first test case, the given string\n\"hello\" is not balanced: letters 'h', 'e', and 'o' appear in it once, while\nletter 'l' appears twice. On the other hand, string \"helno\" is balanced: five\ndistinct letters are present in it, and each of them appears exactly once.\nStrings \"hello\" and \"helno\" differ in just one position: the fourth character.\nOther solutions are possible too. In the second test case, string \"codefofced\"\nis balanced since only letters 'c', 'o', 'd', 'e', and 'f' are present in it,\nand each of them appears exactly twice. In the third test case, string \"eeeee\"\nis balanced since only letter 'e' is present in it. In the fourth test case,\nthe given string \"appall\" is already balanced.\n\n",
