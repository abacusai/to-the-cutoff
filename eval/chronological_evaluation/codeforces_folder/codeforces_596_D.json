        "description": "Wilbur the pig really wants to be a beaver, so he decided today to pretend he\nis a beaver and bite at trees to cut them down. There are n trees located at\nvarious positions on a line. Tree i is located at position xi. All the given\npositions of the trees are distinct. The trees are equal, i.e. each tree has\nheight h. Due to the wind, when a tree is cut down, it either falls left with\nprobability p, or falls right with probability 1 - p. If a tree hits another\ntree while falling, that tree will fall in the same direction as the tree that\nhit it. A tree can hit another tree only if the distance between them is\nstrictly less than h. For example, imagine there are 4 trees located at\npositions 1, 3, 5 and 8, while h = 3 and the tree at position 1 falls right.\nIt hits the tree at position 3 and it starts to fall too. In it's turn it hits\nthe tree at position 5 and it also starts to fall. The distance between 8 and\n5 is exactly 3, so the tree at position 8 will not fall. As long as there are\nstill trees standing, Wilbur will select either the leftmost standing tree\nwith probability 0.5 or the rightmost standing tree with probability 0.5.\nSelected tree is then cut down. If there is only one tree remaining, Wilbur\nalways selects it. As the ground is covered with grass, Wilbur wants to know\nthe expected total length of the ground covered with fallen trees after he\ncuts them all down because he is concerned about his grass-eating cow friends.\nPlease help Wilbur. Input The first line of the input contains two integers, n\n(1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000) and h (1 \u2264 h \u2264 10^8) and a real number p (0 \u2264 p \u2264 1), given\nwith no more than six decimal places. The second line of the input contains n\nintegers, x1, x2, ..., xn ( - 10^8 \u2264 xi \u2264 10^8) in no particular order. Output\nPrint a single real number \u2014 the expected total length of the ground covered\nby trees when they have all fallen down. Your answer will be considered\ncorrect if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^-6. Namely: let's\nassume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker\nprogram will consider your answer correct, if . Examples Input 2 2 0.500000 1\n2 Output 3.250000000 Input 4 3 0.4 4 3 1 2 Output 6.631200000 Note Consider\nthe first example, we have 2 trees with height 2. There are 3 scenarios: 1.\nBoth trees falls left. This can either happen with the right tree falling left\nfirst, which has probability (also knocking down the left tree), or the left\ntree can fall left and then the right tree can fall left, which has\nprobability. Total probability is . 2\u1e02oth trees fall right. This is\nanalogous to (1), so the probability of this happening is . 3\u1e6ahe left tree\nfall left and the right tree falls right. This is the only remaining scenario\nso it must have probability. Cases 1 and 2 lead to a total of 3 units of\nground covered, while case 3 leads to a total of 4 units of ground covered.\nThus, the expected value is .\n\n",
