        "description": "Hosssam decided to sneak into Hemose's room while he is sleeping and change\nhis laptop's password. He already knows the password, which is a string\n\n    s\n of length \n    n\n. He also knows that there are \n    k\n special\nletters of the alphabet: \n    c_1,c_2,\n    \u2026, c_k\n. Hosssam made a program\nthat can do the following. The program considers the current password \n    s\n\nof some length \n    m\n. Then it finds all positions \n    i\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 i<m\n)\nsuch that \n    s_i+1\n is one of the \n    k\n special letters. Then it deletes\nall of those positions from the password \n    s\n even if \n    s_i\n is a\nspecial character. If there are no positions to delete, then the program\ndisplays an error message which has a very loud sound. For example, suppose\nthe string \n    s\n is \"abcdef\" and the special characters are 'b' and 'd'. If\nhe runs the program once, the positions \n    1\n and \n    3\n will be deleted as\nthey come before special characters, so the password becomes \"bdef\". If he\nruns the program again, it deletes position \n    1\n, and the password becomes\n\"def\". If he is wise, he won't run it a third time. Hosssam wants to know how\nmany times he can run the program on Hemose's laptop without waking him up\nfrom the sound of the error message. Can you help him? Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of each test case\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the initial\nlength of the password. The next line contains a string \n    s\n consisting of\n\n    n\n lowercase English letters \u2014 the initial password. The next line\ncontains an integer \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 26\n), followed by \n    k\n\ndistinct lowercase letters \n    c_1,c_2,\n    \u2026,c_k\n \u2014 the special letters.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print the maximum number of\ntimes Hosssam can run the program without displaying the error message, on a\nnew line. Example Input 10 9 iloveslim 1 s 7 joobeel 2 o e 7 basiozi 2 s i 6\nkhater 1 r 7 abobeih 6 a b e h i o 5 zondl 5 a b c e f 6 shoman 2 a h 7\nshetwey 2 h y 5 samez 1 m 6 mouraz 1 m Output 5 2 3 5 1 0 3 5 2 0 Note In the\nfirst test case, the program can run \n    5\n times as follows:\n\n    iloveslim\n    \u2192\n    ilovslim\n    \u2192\n    iloslim\n    \u2192\n    ilslim\n    \u2192\n    islim\n    \u2192\n    slim\n In the second test\ncase, the program can run \n    2\n times as follows: \n    joobeel\n    \u2192\n    oel\n    \u2192\n    el\n In the third test case, the program can run\n\n    3\n times as follows: \n    basiozi\n    \u2192\n    bioi\n    \u2192\n    ii\n    \u2192\n    i\n. In the fourth test case, the program can run\n\n    5\n times as follows: \n    khater\n    \u2192\n    khatr\n    \u2192\n    khar\n    \u2192\n    khr\n    \u2192\n    kr\n    \u2192\n    r\n In the\nfifth test case, the program can run only once as follows: \n    abobeih\n    \u2192\n    h\n In the sixth test case, the program cannot run as none of\nthe characters in the password is a special character.\n\n",
