        "description": "Vitalik the philatelist has a birthday today! As he is a regular customer in a\nstamp store called 'Robin Bobin', the store management decided to make him a\ngift. Vitalik wants to buy one stamp and the store will give him a non-empty\nset of the remaining stamps, such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of\nthe price of the stamps they give to him is more than one. If the GCD of\nprices of the purchased stamp and prices of present stamps set will be equal\nto 1, then Vitalik will leave the store completely happy. The store management\nasks you to count the number of different situations in which Vitalik will\nleave the store completely happy. Since the required number of situations can\nbe very large, you need to find the remainder of this number modulo 10^9 + 7.\nThe situations are different if the stamps purchased by Vitalik are different,\nor if one of the present sets contains a stamp that the other present does not\ncontain. Input The first line of the input contains integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 5\u00b710^5)\n\u2014 the number of distinct stamps, available for sale in the 'Robin Bobin'\nstore. The second line contains a sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (2 \u2264 ai\n\u2264 10^7), where ai is the price of the i-th stamp. Output Print a single\ninteger \u2014 the remainder of the sought number of situations modulo 10^9 + 7.\nExamples Input 3 2 3 2 Output 5 Input 2 9 6 Output 0 Note In the first sample\nthe following situations are possible: Vitalik buys the 1-st stamp, the store\ngives him the 2-nd stamp as a present; Vitalik buys the 3-rd stamp, the store\ngives him the 2-nd stamp as a present; Vitalik buys the 2-nd stamp, the store\ngives him the 1-st stamp as a present; Vitalik buys the 2-nd stamp, the store\ngives him the 3-rd stamp as a present; Vitalik buys the 2-nd stamp, the store\ngives him the 1-st and 3-rd stamps as a present.\n\n",
