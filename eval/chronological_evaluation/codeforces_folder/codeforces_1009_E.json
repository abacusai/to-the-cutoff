        "description": "Leha is planning his journey from Moscow to Saratov. He hates trains, so he\nhas decided to get from one city to another by car. The path from Moscow to\nSaratov can be represented as a straight line (well, it's not that straight in\nreality, but in this problem we will consider it to be straight), and the\ndistance between Moscow and Saratov is \n    n\n km. Let's say that Moscow is\nsituated at the point with coordinate \n    0\n km, and Saratov \u2014 at coordinate\n\n    n\n km. Driving for a long time may be really difficult. Formally, if Leha\nhas already covered \n    i\n kilometers since he stopped to have a rest, he\nconsiders the difficulty of covering \n    (i + 1)\n-th kilometer as \n    a_i +\n    1\n. It is guaranteed that for every \n    i \n    \u2208 [1, n - 1]\n \n    a_i \n    \u2264\n    a_i + 1\n. The difficulty of the journey is denoted as the sum of\ndifficulties of each kilometer in the journey. Fortunately, there may be some\nrest sites between Moscow and Saratov. Every integer point from \n    1\n to\n\n    n - 1\n may contain a rest site. When Leha enters a rest site, he may have\na rest, and the next kilometer will have difficulty \n    a_1\n, the kilometer\nafter it \u2014 difficulty \n    a_2\n, and so on. For example, if \n    n = 5\n and\nthere is a rest site in coordinate \n    2\n, the difficulty of journey will be\n\n    2a_1 + 2a_2 + a_3\n: the first kilometer will have difficulty \n    a_1\n,\nthe second one \u2014 \n    a_2\n, then Leha will have a rest, and the third\nkilometer will have difficulty \n    a_1\n, the fourth \u2014 \n    a_2\n, and the last\none \u2014 \n    a_3\n. Another example: if \n    n = 7\n and there are rest sites in\ncoordinates \n    1\n and \n    5\n, the difficulty of Leha's journey is \n    3a_1 +\n    2a_2 + a_3 + a_4\n. Leha doesn't know which integer points contain rest\nsites. So he has to consider every possible situation. Obviously, there are\n\n    2^n - 1\n different distributions of rest sites (two distributions are\ndifferent if there exists some point \n    x\n such that it contains a rest site\nin exactly one of these distributions). Leha considers all these distributions\nto be equiprobable. He wants to calculate \n    p\n \u2014 the expected value of\ndifficulty of his journey. Obviously, \n    p \n    \u00b7 2^n - 1\n is an integer\nnumber. You have to calculate it modulo \n    998244353\n. Input The first line\ncontains one number \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the distance from\nMoscow to Saratov. The second line contains \n    n\n integer numbers \n    a_1\n,\n\n    a_2\n, ..., \n    a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_1 \n    \u2264 a_2 \n    \u2264\n    \u2026\n    \u2264 a_n\n    \n    \u2264 10^6\n), where \n    a_i\n is the difficulty of \n    i\n-th kilometer\nafter Leha has rested. Output Print one number \u2014 \n    p \n    \u00b7 2^n - 1\n,\ntaken modulo \n    998244353\n. Examples Input 2 1 2 Output 5 Input 4 1 3 3 7\nOutput 60\n\n",
