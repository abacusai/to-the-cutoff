        "name": "Gojou and Matrix Game",
        "description": "Marin feels exhausted after a long day of cosplay, so Gojou invites her to\nplay a game! Marin and Gojou take turns to place one of their tokens on an\n\n    n \n    \u00d7 n\n grid with Marin starting first. There are some restrictions\nand allowances on where to place tokens: Apart from the first move, the token\nplaced by a player must be more than Manhattan distance \n    k\n away from the\nprevious token placed on the matrix. In other words, if a player places a\ntoken at \n    (x_1, y_1)\n, then the token placed by the other player in the\nnext move must be in a cell \n    (x_2, y_2)\n satisfying \n    |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2\n    - y_1| > k\n. Apart from the previous restriction, a token can be placed\nanywhere on the matrix, including cells where tokens were previously placed by\nany player. Whenever a player places a token on cell \n    (x, y)\n, that player\ngets \n    v_x,\n     y\n points. All values of \n    v\n on the grid are distinct.\nYou still get points from a cell even if tokens were already placed onto the\ncell. The game finishes when each player makes \n    10^100\n moves. Marin and\nGojou will play \n    n^2\n games. For each cell of the grid, there will be\nexactly one game where Marin places a token on that cell on her first move.\nPlease answer for each game, if Marin and Gojou play optimally (after Marin's\nfirst move), who will have more points at the end? Or will the game end in a\ndraw (both players have the same points at the end)? Input The first line\ncontains two integers \n    n\n, \n    k\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2000\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n - 2\n). Note that under these constraints it is always\npossible to make a move. The following \n    n\n lines contains \n    n\n integers\neach. The \n    j\n-th integer in the \n    i\n-th line is \n    v_i,j\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 v_i,j\n    \u2264 n^2\n). All elements in \n    v\n are distinct. Output You\nshould print \n    n\n lines. In the \n    i\n-th line, print \n    n\n characters,\nwhere the \n    j\n-th character is the result of the game in which Marin places\nher first token in the cell \n    (i, j)\n. Print 'M' if Marin wins, 'G' if\nGojou wins, and 'D' if the game ends in a draw. Do not print spaces between\nthe characters in one line. Example Input 3 1 1 2 4 6 8 3 9 5 7 Output GGG MGG\nMGG\n\n",
