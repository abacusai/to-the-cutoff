        "description": "Bertown is a city with \n    n\n buildings in a straight line. The city's\nsecurity service discovered that some buildings were mined. A map was\ncompiled, which is a string of length \n    n\n, where the \n    i\n-th character\nis \"1\" if there is a mine under the building number \n    i\n and \"0\" otherwise.\nBertown's best sapper knows how to activate mines so that the buildings above\nthem are not damaged. When a mine under the building numbered \n    x\n is\nactivated, it explodes and activates two adjacent mines under the buildings\nnumbered \n    x-1\n and \n    x+1\n (if there were no mines under the building,\nthen nothing happens). Thus, it is enough to activate any one mine on a\ncontinuous segment of mines to activate all the mines of this segment. For\nmanual activation of one mine, the sapper takes \n    a\n coins. He can repeat\nthis operation as many times as you want. Also, a sapper can place a mine\nunder a building if it wasn't there. For such an operation, he takes \n    b\n\ncoins. He can also repeat this operation as many times as you want. The sapper\ncan carry out operations in any order. You want to blow up all the mines in\nthe city to make it safe. Find the minimum number of coins that the sapper\nwill have to pay so that after his actions there are no mines left in the\ncity. Input The first line contains one positive integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow.\nEach test case begins with a line containing two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the cost of activating and placing one mine,\nrespectively. The next line contains a map of mines in the city \u2014 a string\nconsisting of zeros and ones. The sum of the string lengths for all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output one integer \u2014\nthe minimum number of coins that the sapper will have to pay. Example Input 2\n1 1 01000010 5 1 01101110 Output 2 6 Note In the second test case, if we place\na mine under the fourth building and then activate it, then all mines on the\nfield are activated. The cost of such operations is six, \n    b=1\n coin for\nplacing a mine and \n    a=5\n coins for activating.\n\n",
