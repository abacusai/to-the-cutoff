        "description": "At the Byteland State University marks are strings of the same length. Mark x\nis considered better than y if string y is lexicographically smaller than x.\nRecently at the BSU was an important test work on which Vasya recived the mark\na. It is very hard for the teacher to remember the exact mark of every\nstudent, but he knows the mark b, such that every student recieved mark\nstrictly smaller than b. Vasya isn't satisfied with his mark so he decided to\nimprove it. He can swap characters in the string corresponding to his mark as\nmany times as he like. Now he want to know only the number of different ways\nto improve his mark so that his teacher didn't notice something suspicious.\nMore formally: you are given two strings a, b of the same length and you need\nto figure out the number of different strings c such that: 1) c can be\nobtained from a by swapping some characters, in other words c is a permutation\nof a. 2) String a is lexicographically smaller than c. 3) String c is\nlexicographically smaller than b. For two strings x and y of the same length\nit is true that x is lexicographically smaller than y if there exists such i,\nthat x1 = y1, x2 = y2, ..., xi - 1 = yi - 1, xi < yi. Since the answer can be\nvery large, you need to find answer modulo 10^9 + 7. Input First line contains\nstring a, second line contains string b. Strings a, b consist of lowercase\nEnglish letters. Their lengths are equal and don't exceed 10^6. It is\nguaranteed that a is lexicographically smaller than b. Output Print one\ninteger \u2014 the number of different strings satisfying the condition of the\nproblem modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input abc ddd Output 5 Input abcdef abcdeg\nOutput 0 Input abacaba ubuduba Output 64 Note In first sample from string abc\ncan be obtained strings acb, bac, bca, cab, cba, all of them are larger than\nabc, but smaller than ddd. So the answer is 5. In second sample any string\nobtained from abcdef is larger than abcdeg. So the answer is 0.\n\n",
