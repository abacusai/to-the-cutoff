        "description": "The company \"Divan's Sofas\" is planning to build \n    n + 1\n different\nbuildings on a coordinate line so that: the coordinate of each building is an\ninteger number; no two buildings stand at the same point. Let \n    x_i\n be the\ncoordinate of the \n    i\n-th building. To get from the building \n    i\n to the\nbuilding \n    j\n, Divan spends \n    |x_i - x_j|\n minutes, where \n    |y|\n is\nthe absolute value of \n    y\n. All buildings that Divan is going to build can\nbe numbered from \n    0\n to \n    n\n. The businessman will live in the building\n\n    0\n, the new headquarters of \"Divan's Sofas\". In the first ten years after\nconstruction Divan will visit the \n    i\n-th building \n    a_i\n times, each\ntime spending \n    2 \n    \u00b7 |x_0-x_i|\n minutes for walking. Divan asks you to\nchoose the coordinates for all \n    n + 1\n buildings so that over the next ten\nyears the businessman will spend as little time for walking as possible. Input\nEach test contains several test cases. The first line contains one integer\nnumber \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\nfirst line of each case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of buildings that \"Divan's Sofas\" is going to\nbuild, apart from the headquarters. The second line contains the sequence\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n), where \n    a_i\n\nis the number of visits to the \n    i\n-th building. It is guaranteed that the\nsum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n.\nOutput For each test case, on the first line print the number \n    T\n \u2014 the\nminimum time Divan will spend walking. On the second line print the sequence\n\n    x_0, x_1, \n    \u2026, x_n\n of \n    n + 1\n integers, where \n    x_i\n\n(\n    -10^6 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n) is the selected coordinate of the\n\n    i\n-th building. It can be shown that an optimal answer exists with\ncoordinates not exceeding \n    10^6\n. If there are multiple answers, print any\nof them. Example Input 4 3 1 2 3 5 3 8 10 6 1 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 Output 14 2 4 1\n3 78 1 -1 0 2 3 4 18 3 6 1 5 2 4 0 1 2 Note Let's look at the first example.\nDivan will visit the first building \n    a_1 = 1\n times, the second \n    a_2 =\n    2\n times and the third \n    a_3 = 3\n times. Then one of the optimal solution\nwill be as follows: the headquarters is located in \n    x_0 = 2\n; \n    x_1 =\n    4\n: Divan will spend \n    2 \n    \u00b7 |x_0-x_1| \n    \u00b7 a_1 = 2 \n    \u00b7 |2-4|\n    \n    \u00b7 1 = 4\n minutes walking to the first building; \n    x_2 = 1\n: Divan\nwill spend \n    2 \n    \u00b7 |x_0-x_2| \n    \u00b7 a_2 = 2 \n    \u00b7 |2-1| \n    \u00b7 2 =\n    4\n minutes walking to the second building; \n    x_3 = 3\n: Divan will spend\n\n    2 \n    \u00b7 |x_0-x_3| \n    \u00b7 a_3 = 2 \n    \u00b7 |2-3| \n    \u00b7 3 = 6\n minutes\nwalking to the third building. In total, Divan will spend \n    4 + 4 + 6 = 14\n\nminutes. It can be shown that it is impossible to arrange buildings so that\nthe businessman spends less time. Among others, \n    x = [1, 3, 2, 0]\n, \n    x =\n    [-5, -3, -6, -4]\n are also correct answers for the first example.\n\n",
