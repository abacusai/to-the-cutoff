        "name": "Education Reform",
        "description": "Yet another education system reform has been carried out in Berland recently.\nThe innovations are as follows: An academic year now consists of n days. Each\nday pupils study exactly one of m subjects, besides, each subject is studied\nfor no more than one day. After the lessons of the i-th subject pupils get the\nhome task that contains no less than ai and no more than bi exercises.\nBesides, each subject has a special attribute, the complexity (ci). A school\ncan make its own timetable, considering the following conditions are\nsatisfied: the timetable should contain the subjects in the order of the\ncomplexity's strict increasing; each day, except for the first one, the task\nshould contain either k times more exercises, or more by k compared to the\nprevious day (more formally: let's call the number of home task exercises in\nthe i-th day as xi, then for each i (1 < i \u2264 n): either xi = k + xi - 1 or xi\n= k\u00b7xi - 1 must be true); the total number of exercises in all home tasks\nshould be maximal possible. All limitations are separately set for each\nschool. It turned out that in many cases ai and bi reach 10^16 (however, as\nthe Berland Minister of Education is famous for his love to half-measures, the\nvalue of bi - ai doesn't exceed 100). That also happened in the Berland School\n\u2116256. Nevertheless, you as the school's principal still have to work out the\ntimetable for the next academic year... Input The first line contains three\nintegers n, m, k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 m \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 100) which represent the number of\ndays in an academic year, the number of subjects and the k parameter\ncorrespondingly. Each of the following m lines contains the description of a\nsubject as three integers ai, bi, ci (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 bi \u2264 10^16, bi - ai \u2264 100, 1 \u2264\nci \u2264 100) \u2014 two limitations to the number of exercises on the i-th subject and\nthe complexity of the i-th subject, correspondingly. Distinct subjects can\nhave the same complexity. The subjects are numbered with integers from 1 to m.\nPlease do not use the \n\u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin stream or the \nIf no valid solution exists, print the single word \"NO\" (without the quotes).\nOtherwise, the first line should contain the word \"YES\" (without the quotes)\nand the next n lines should contain any timetable that satisfies all the\nconditions. The i + 1-th line should contain two positive integers: the number\nof the subject to study on the i-th day and the number of home task exercises\ngiven for this subject. The timetable should contain exactly n subjects.\nExamples Input 4 5 2 1 10 1 1 10 2 1 10 3 1 20 4 1 100 5 Output YES 2 8 3 10 4\n20 5 40 Input 3 4 3 1 3 1 2 4 4 2 3 3 2 2 2 Output NO\n\n",
