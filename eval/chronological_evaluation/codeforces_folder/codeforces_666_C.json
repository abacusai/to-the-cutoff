        "description": "The famous sculptor Cicasso is a Reberlandian spy! These is breaking news in\nBerlandian papers today. And now the sculptor is hiding. This time you give\nthe shelter to the maestro. You have a protected bunker and you provide it to\nyour friend. You set the security system in such way that only you can open\nthe bunker. To open it one should solve the problem which is hard for others\nbut is simple for you. Every day the bunker generates a codeword s. Every time\nsomeone wants to enter the bunker, integer n appears on the screen. As the\nanswer one should enter another integer \u2014 the residue modulo 10^9 + 7 of the\nnumber of strings of length n that consist only of lowercase English letters\nand contain the string s as the subsequence. The subsequence of string a is a\nstring b that can be derived from the string a by removing some symbols from\nit (maybe none or all of them). In particular any string is the subsequence of\nitself. For example, the string \"cfo\" is the subsequence of the string\n\"codeforces\". You haven't implemented the algorithm that calculates the\ncorrect answers yet and you should do that ASAP. Input The first line contains\ninteger m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of the events in the test case. The\nsecond line contains nonempty string s \u2014 the string generated by the bunker\nfor the current day. The next m lines contain the description of the events.\nThe description starts from integer t \u2014 the type of the event. If t = 1\nconsider a new day has come and now a new string s is used. In that case the\nsame line contains a new value of the string s. If t = 2 integer n is given (1\n\u2264 n \u2264 10^5). This event means that it's needed to find the answer for the\ncurrent string s and the value n. The sum of lengths of all generated strings\ndoesn't exceed 10^5. All of the given strings consist only of lowercase\nEnglish letters. Output For each query of the type 2 print the answer modulo\n10^9 + 7 on the separate line. Example Input 3 a 2 2 1 bc 2 5 Output 51 162626\nNote In the first event words of the form \"a?\" and \"?a\" are counted, where ?\nis an arbitrary symbol. There are 26 words of each of these types, but the\nword \"aa\" satisfies both patterns, so the answer is 51.\n\n",
