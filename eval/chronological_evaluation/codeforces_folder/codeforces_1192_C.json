        "description": "A cubeword is a special type of a crossword. When building a cubeword, you\nstart by choosing a positive integer \n    a\n: the side length of the cube.\nThen, you build a big cube consisting of \n    a \n    \u00d7 a \n    \u00d7 a\n unit\ncubes. This big cube has 12 edges. Then, you discard all unit cubes that do\nnot touch the edges of the big cube. The figure below shows the object you\nwill get for \n    a=6\n. Finally, you assign a letter to each of the unit cubes\nin the object. You must get a meaningful word along each edge of the big cube.\nEach edge can be read in either direction, and it is sufficient if one of the\ntwo directions of reading gives a meaningful word. The figure below shows the\nobject for \n    a=6\n in which some unit cubes already have assigned letters.\nYou can already read the words 'SUBMIT', 'ACCEPT' and 'TURING' along three\nedges of the big cube. You are given a list of valid words. Each word from the\nwordlist may appear on arbitrarily many edges of a valid cubeword. Find and\nreport the number of different cubewords that can be constructed, modulo\n\n    998,244,353\n. If one cubeword can be obtained from another by rotation or\nmirroring, they are considered distinct. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100,000\n) \u2013 the number of\nwords. Then, \n    n\n lines follow. Each of these lines contains one word that\ncan appear on the edges of the big cube. The length of each word is between 3\nand 10, inclusive. It is guaranteed that all words are different. Output\nOutput a single integer, the number of distinct cubewords for the given list\nof valid words modulo \n    998,244,353\n. Scoring Subtask 1 (21 points): the\nwords consist only of letters 'a' - 'f' (lowercase) Subtask 2 (29 points): the\nwords consist only of letters 'a' - 'p' (lowercase) Subtask 3 (34 points): the\nwords consist of letters 'a' - 'p' (lowercase) and 'A' - 'P' (uppercase)\nSubtask 4 (16 points): the words consist of letters 'a' - 'z' (lowercase), 'A'\n- 'Z' (uppercase) and digits '0' - '9' Examples Input 1 radar Output 1 Input 1\nrobot Output 2 Input 2 FLOW WOLF Output 2 Input 2 baobab bob Output 4097 Input\n3 TURING SUBMIT ACCEPT Output 162 Input 3 MAN1LA MAN6OS AN4NAS Output 114 Note\nIn the first sample, the only possibility is for the word \"radar\" to be on\neach edge of the cube. In the second sample, there are two cubes, which are\njust rotations of each other \u2013 the word \"robot\" is on every edge, and the\ndifference between the two cubes is whether the lower left front corner\ncontains 'r' or 't'. The third sample is similar to the second one. The fact\nthat we can read the word on each edge in both directions does not affect the\nanswer. In the fourth sample, there is one cube with the word \"bob\" on each\nedge. There are also \n    2^12 = 4096\n cubes with the word \"baobab\" on each\nedge. (For each of the 12 edges, we have two possible directions in which the\nword \"baobab\" can appear.)\n\n",
