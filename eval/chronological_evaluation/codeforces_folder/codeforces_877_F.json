        "description": "In Ann's favorite book shop are as many as n books on math and economics.\nBooks are numbered from 1 to n. Each of them contains non-negative number of\nproblems. Today there is a sale: any subsegment of a segment from l to r can\nbe bought at a fixed price. Ann decided that she wants to buy such non-empty\nsubsegment that the sale operates on it and the number of math problems is\ngreater than the number of economics problems exactly by k. Note that k may be\npositive, negative or zero. Unfortunately, Ann is not sure on which segment\nthe sale operates, but she has q assumptions. For each of them she wants to\nknow the number of options to buy a subsegment satisfying the condition\n(because the time she spends on choosing depends on that). Currently Ann is\ntoo busy solving other problems, she asks you for help. For each her\nassumption determine the number of subsegments of the given segment such that\nthe number of math problems is greaten than the number of economics problems\non that subsegment exactly by k. Input The first line contains two integers n\nand k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, - 10^9 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of books and the\nneeded difference between the number of math problems and the number of\neconomics problems. The second line contains n integers t1, t2, ..., tn (1 \u2264\nti \u2264 2), where ti is 1 if the i-th book is on math or 2 if the i-th is on\neconomics. The third line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9),\nwhere ai is the number of problems in the i-th book. The fourth line contains\na single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of assumptions. Each of the\nnext q lines contains two integers li and ri (1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 n) describing the\ni-th Ann's assumption. Output Print q lines, in the i-th of them print the\nnumber of subsegments for the i-th Ann's assumption. Examples Input 4 1 1 1 1\n2 1 1 1 1 4 1 2 1 3 1 4 3 4 Output 2 3 4 1 Input 4 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 4\nOutput 10 Note In the first sample Ann can buy subsegments [1;1], [2;2],\n[3;3], [2;4] if they fall into the sales segment, because the number of math\nproblems is greater by 1 on them that the number of economics problems. So we\nshould count for each assumption the number of these subsegments that are\nsubsegments of the given segment. Segments [1;1] and [2;2] are subsegments of\n[1;2]. Segments [1;1], [2;2] and [3;3] are subsegments of [1;3]. Segments\n[1;1], [2;2], [3;3], [2;4] are subsegments of [1;4]. Segment [3;3] is\nsubsegment of [3;4].\n\n",
