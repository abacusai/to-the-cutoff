        "description": "If the girl doesn't go to Denis, then Denis will go to the girl. Using this\nrule, the young man left home, bought flowers and went to Nastya. On the way\nfrom Denis's house to the girl's house is a road of \n    n\n lines. This road\ncan't be always crossed in one green light. Foreseeing this, the good mayor\ndecided to place safety islands in some parts of the road. Each safety island\nis located after a line, as well as at the beginning and at the end of the\nroad. Pedestrians can relax on them, gain strength and wait for a green light.\nDenis came to the edge of the road exactly at the moment when the green light\nturned on. The boy knows that the traffic light first lights up \n    g\n\nseconds green, and then \n    r\n seconds red, then again \n    g\n seconds green\nand so on. Formally, the road can be represented as a segment \n    [0, n]\n.\nInitially, Denis is at point \n    0\n. His task is to get to point \n    n\n in\nthe shortest possible time. He knows many different integers \n    d_1, d_2,\n    \n    \u2026, d_m\n, where \n    0 \n    \u2264 d_i \n    \u2264 n\n \u2014 are the coordinates of\npoints, in which the safety islands are located. Only at one of these points,\nthe boy can be at a time when the red light is on. Unfortunately, Denis isn't\nalways able to control himself because of the excitement, so some restrictions\nare imposed: He must always move while the green light is on because it's\ndifficult to stand when so beautiful girl is waiting for you. Denis can change\nhis position by \n    \u00b1 1\n in \n    1\n second. While doing so, he must\nalways stay inside the segment \n    [0, n]\n. He can change his direction only\non the safety islands (because it is safe). This means that if in the previous\nsecond the boy changed his position by \n    +1\n and he walked on a safety\nisland, then he can change his position by \n    \u00b1 1\n. Otherwise, he can\nchange his position only by \n    +1\n. Similarly, if in the previous second he\nchanged his position by \n    -1\n, on a safety island he can change position by\n\n    \u00b1 1\n, and at any other point by \n    -1\n. At the moment when the red\nlight is on, the boy must be on one of the safety islands. He can continue\nmoving in any direction when the green light is on. Denis has crossed the road\nas soon as his coordinate becomes equal to \n    n\n. This task was not so\nsimple, because it's possible that it is impossible to cross the road. Since\nDenis has all thoughts about his love, he couldn't solve this problem and\nasked us to help him. Find the minimal possible time for which he can cross\nthe road according to these rules, or find that it is impossible to do. Input\nThe first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^6, 2 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 min(n + 1, 10^4))\n \u2014 road width and the number of\nsafety islands. The second line contains \n    m\n distinct integers \n    d_1,\n    d_2, \n    \u2026, d_m\n \n    (0 \n    \u2264 d_i \n    \u2264 n)\n \u2014 the points where the\nsafety islands are located. It is guaranteed that there are \n    0\n and\n\n    n\n among them. The third line contains two integers \n    g, r\n \n    (1\n    \n    \u2264 g, r \n    \u2264 1000)\n \u2014 the time that the green light stays on and the\ntime that the red light stays on. Output Output a single integer \u2014 the minimum\ntime for which Denis can cross the road with obeying all the rules. If it is\nimpossible to cross the road output \n    -1\n. Examples Input 15 5 0 3 7 14 15\n11 11 Output 45 Input 13 4 0 3 7 13 9 9 Output -1 Note In the first test, the\noptimal route is: for the first green light, go to \n    7\n and return to\n\n    3\n. In this case, we will change the direction of movement at the point\n\n    7\n, which is allowed, since there is a safety island at this point. In\nthe end, we will be at the point of \n    3\n, where there is also a safety\nisland. The next \n    11\n seconds we have to wait for the red light. for the\nsecond green light reaches \n    14\n. Wait for the red light again. for \n    1\n\nsecond go to \n    15\n. As a result, Denis is at the end of the road. In total,\n\n    45\n seconds are obtained. In the second test, it is impossible to cross\nthe road according to all the rules.\n\n",
