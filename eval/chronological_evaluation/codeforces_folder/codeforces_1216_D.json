        "description": "There were \n    n\n types of swords in the theater basement which had been used\nduring the plays. Moreover there were exactly \n    x\n swords of each type.\n\n    y\n people have broken into the theater basement and each of them has\ntaken exactly \n    z\n swords of some single type. Note that different people\nmight have taken different types of swords. Note that the values \n    x, y\n\nand \n    z\n are unknown for you. The next morning the director of the theater\ndiscovers the loss. He counts all swords \u2014 exactly \n    a_i\n swords of the\n\n    i\n-th type are left untouched. The director has no clue about the initial\nnumber of swords of each type in the basement, the number of people who have\nbroken into the basement and how many swords each of them have taken. For\nexample, if \n    n=3\n, \n    a = [3, 12, 6]\n then one of the possible\nsituations is \n    x=12\n, \n    y=5\n and \n    z=3\n. Then the first three people\ntook swords of the first type and the other two people took swords of the\nthird type. Note that you don't know values \n    x, y\n and \n    z\n beforehand\nbut know values of \n    n\n and \n    a\n. Thus he seeks for your help. Determine\nthe minimum number of people \n    y\n, which could have broken into the theater\nbasement, and the number of swords \n    z\n each of them has taken. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains one integer \n    n\n \n    (2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5)\n \u2014 the number of types of swords. The second line of the\ninput contains the sequence \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n \n    (0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9)\n, where \n    a_i\n equals to the number of swords of the \n    i\n-th\ntype, which have remained in the basement after the theft. It is guaranteed\nthat there exists at least one such pair of indices \n    (j, k)\n that \n    a_j\n    \n    \u2260 a_k\n. Output Print two integers \n    y\n and \n    z\n \u2014 the minimum\nnumber of people which could have broken into the basement and the number of\nswords each of them has taken. Examples Input 3 3 12 6 Output 5 3 Input 2 2 9\nOutput 1 7 Input 7 2 1000000000 4 6 8 4 2 Output 2999999987 2 Input 6 13 52 0\n13 26 52 Output 12 13 Note In the first example the minimum value of \n    y\n\nequals to \n    5\n, i.e. the minimum number of people who could have broken\ninto the basement, is \n    5\n. Each of them has taken \n    3\n swords: three of\nthem have taken \n    3\n swords of the first type, and two others have taken\n\n    3\n swords of the third type. In the second example the minimum value of\n\n    y\n is \n    1\n, i.e. the minimum number of people who could have broken\ninto the basement, equals to \n    1\n. He has taken \n    7\n swords of the first\ntype.\n\n",
