        "description": "Little Misha goes to the programming club and solves nothing there. It may\nseem strange, but when you find out that Misha is filming a Minecraft series,\neverything will fall into place... Misha is inspired by Manhattan, so he built\na city in Minecraft that can be imagined as a table of size \n    n \n    \u00d7\n    m\n. \n    k\n students live in a city, the \n    i\n-th student lives in the\nhouse, located at the intersection of the \n    x_i\n-th row and the\n\n    y_i\n-th column. Also, each student has a degree of his aggressiveness\n\n    w_i\n. Since the city turned out to be very large, Misha decided to\nterritorially limit the actions of his series to some square \n    s\n, which\nsides are parallel to the coordinate axes. The length of the side of the\nsquare should be an integer from \n    1\n to \n    min(n, m)\n cells.\nAccording to the plot, the main hero will come to the city and accidentally\nfall into the square \n    s\n. Possessing a unique degree of aggressiveness\n\n    0\n, he will be able to show his leadership qualities and assemble a team\nof calm, moderate and aggressive students. In order for the assembled team to\nbe versatile and close-knit, degrees of aggressiveness of all students of the\nteam must be pairwise distinct and must form a single segment of consecutive\nintegers. Formally, if there exist students with degrees of aggressiveness\n\n    l, l+1, \n    \u2026, -1, 1, \n    \u2026, r-1, r\n inside the square \n    s\n,\nwhere \n    l \n    \u2264 0 \n    \u2264 r\n, the main hero will be able to form a team of\n\n    r-l+1\n people (of course, he is included in this team). Notice, that it\nis not required to take all students from square \n    s\n to the team. Misha\nthinks that the team should consist of at least \n    t\n people. That is why he\nis interested, how many squares are there in the table in which the main hero\nwill be able to form a team of at least \n    t\n people. Help him to calculate\nthis. Input The first line contains four integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, \n    k\n\nand \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 40\n     000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u00b7 m \n    \u2264\n    40\n     000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^6\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 k + 1\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of rows and columns in the table, and the number of students living in\nthe city, respectively. Each of the following \n    k\n lines contains three\nintegers \n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n and \n    w_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 y_i \n    \u2264 m\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    | w_i \n    |\n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of row and column, where the \n    i\n-th student is living, and the\ndegree of his aggressiveness. Output Print one integer \u2014 the number of ways to\nchoose the square \n    s\n in such way that the main hero will be able to form\na team of at least \n    t\n people. Examples Input 2 2 1 2 1 1 2 Output 0 Input\n2 2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 Output 2 Input 2 2 4 2 1 1 1 1 1 -1 1 2 1 2 2 1 Output 4\nNote In the first example the main hero will not be able to form a team of\nmore than one person in any square \n    s\n. Illustration for the first\nexample. In the second example there are two ways to select square \n    s\n.\nBoth of them are illustrated below. In one of them the main hero will be able\nto form a team of students with degrees of aggressiveness \n    [0, 1]\n, and in\nthe another \u2014 with degrees of aggressiveness \n    [0, 1, 2]\n. Notice, that the\nmain hero with degree of aggressiveness \n    0\n will be included to the team\nregardless of the chosen square. Illustration for the second example. In the\nthird example there are four ways to select square \n    s\n. All of them are\nillustrated below. The main hero will be able to form a team with degrees of\naggressiveness: \n    [-1,0,1]\n, \n    [0,1]\n, \n    [0,1]\n, \n    [-1, 0, 1]\n,\nrespectively. Illustration for the third example.\n\n",
