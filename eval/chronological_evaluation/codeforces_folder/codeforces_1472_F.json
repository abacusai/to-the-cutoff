        "description": "Every year Santa Claus gives gifts to all children. However, each country has\nits own traditions, and this process takes place in different ways. For\nexample, in Berland you need to solve the New Year's puzzle. Polycarp got the\nfollowing problem: given a grid strip of size \n    2 \n    \u00d7 n\n, some cells\nof it are blocked. You need to check if it is possible to tile all free cells\nusing the \n    2 \n    \u00d7 1\n and \n    1 \n    \u00d7 2\n tiles (dominoes). For\nexample, if \n    n = 5\n and the strip looks like this (black cells are\nblocked): Then it can be tiled, for example, using two vertical and two\nhorizontal tiles, as in the picture below (different tiles are marked by\ndifferent colors). And if \n    n = 3\n and the strip looks like this: It is\nimpossible to tile free cells. Polycarp easily solved this task and received\nhis New Year's gift. Can you solve it? Input The first line contains an\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThen \n    t\n test cases follow. Each test case is preceded by an empty line.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of the strip and the number of blocked cells on it. Each of the next\n\n    m\n lines contains two integers \n    r_i, c_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 2, 1\n    \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 numbers of rows and columns of blocked cells. It is\nguaranteed that all blocked cells are different, i.e. \n    (r_i, c_i) \n    \n    (r_j, c_j), i \n     j\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    m\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case,\nprint on a separate line: \"YES\", if it is possible to tile all unblocked\nsquares with the \n    2 \n    \u00d7 1\n and \n    1 \n    \u00d7 2\n tiles; \"NO\"\notherwise. You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the strings\nyEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive). Example Input 3 5 2 2 2\n1 4 3 2 2 1 2 3 6 4 2 1 2 3 2 4 2 6 Output YES NO NO Note The first two test\ncases are explained in the statement. In the third test case the strip looks\nlike this: It is easy to check that the unblocked squares on it can not be\ntiled.\n\n",
