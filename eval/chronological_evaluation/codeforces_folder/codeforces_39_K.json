        "description": "You take part in the testing of new weapon. For the testing a polygon was\ncreated. The polygon is a rectangular field n \u00d7 m in size, divided into unit\nsquares 1 \u00d7 1 in size. The polygon contains k objects, each of which is a\nrectangle with sides, parallel to the polygon sides and entirely occupying\nseveral unit squares. The objects don't intersect and don't touch each other.\nThe principle according to which the weapon works is highly secret. You only\nknow that one can use it to strike any rectangular area whose area is not\nequal to zero with sides, parallel to the sides of the polygon. The area must\ncompletely cover some of the unit squares into which the polygon is divided\nand it must not touch the other squares. Of course the area mustn't cross the\npolygon border. Your task is as follows: you should hit no less than one and\nno more than three rectangular objects. Each object must either lay completely\ninside the area (in that case it is considered to be hit), or lay completely\noutside the area. Find the number of ways of hitting. Input The first line has\nthree integers n, m \u0438 k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 90) \u2014 the sizes of the\npolygon and the number of objects on it respectively. Next n lines contain m\nsymbols each and describe the polygon. The symbol \"*\" stands for a square\noccupied an object, whereas the symbol \".\" stands for an empty space. The\nsymbols \"*\" form exactly k rectangular connected areas that meet the\nrequirements of the task. Output Output a single number \u2014 the number of\ndifferent ways to hit a target. Examples Input 3 3 3 *.* ... *.. Output 21\nInput 4 5 4 .*.** ...** **... ...** Output 38 Input 2 2 1 .* .. Output 4\n\n",
