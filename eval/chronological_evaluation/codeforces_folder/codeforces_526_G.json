        "name": "Spiders Evil Plan",
        "description": "Spiders are Om Nom's old enemies. They love eating candies as much as he does\nand that's why they keep trying to keep the monster away from his favorite\ncandies. They came up with an evil plan to trap Om Nom. Let's consider a rope\nstructure consisting of n nodes and n - 1 ropes connecting the nodes. The\nstructure is connected, thus, the ropes and the nodes form a tree. Each rope\nof the formed structure is associated with its length. A candy is tied to node\nx of the structure. Om Nom really wants to eat this candy. The y spiders are\ntrying to stop him from doing it. They decided to entangle the candy and some\npart of the structure into a web, thus attaching the candy to as large as\npossible part of the rope structure. Each spider can use his web to cover all\nropes on the path between two arbitrary nodes a and b. Thus, y spiders can\ncover the set of ropes which is a union of y paths in the given tree. These y\npaths can arbitrarily intersect each other. The spiders want the following\nconditions to be hold: the node containing the candy is adjacent to at least\none rope covered with a web the ropes covered with the web form a connected\nstructure (what's the idea of covering with a web the ropes that are not\nconnected with the candy?) the total length of the ropes covered with web is\nas large as possible The spiders haven't yet decided to what node of the\nstructure they will tie the candy and how many spiders will cover the\nstructure with web, so they asked you to help them. Help them calculate the\noptimal plan for multiple values of x and y. Input The first line contains\nnumbers n and q (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of nodes in the structure and\nthe number of questions that the spiders want to ask you. The next n - 1 lines\ndetermine the rope structure. The i-th line contains three integers ui, vi, li\n(1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264 n, ui \u2260 vi, 1 \u2264 li \u2264 1000), showing that there is a rope of\nlength li between nodes ui and vi. Next q lines describe the spiders'\nquestions. As they want you to answer their question online, they encoded\ntheir messages in a special manner. Each of the next q lines contains two\nnumbers xi, yi. In the first question of the spiders x = x1, y = y1. To\ncalculate values x and y in the spiders' i-th (2 \u2264 i \u2264 q) question, you need\nto use the following formulas: where Ansi - 1 is the total length of the ropes\ncovered by a web in the answer for the (i - 1)-th question. The following\ninequality holds: 1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 n. Output For each question of the spiders\nprint on a separate line a single integer Ansi \u2014 the total length of the ropes\ncovered with web in the optimal plan. Examples Input 6 3 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 4 2 4 6\n1 3 5 10 3 1 2 5 1 1 Output 14 13 17\n\n",
