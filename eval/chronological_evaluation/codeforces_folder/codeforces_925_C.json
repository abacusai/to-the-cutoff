        "description": "Vitya has learned that the answer for The Ultimate Question of Life, the\nUniverse, and Everything is not the integer 54 42, but an increasing integer\nsequence \n    a_1, \n    \u2026, a_n\n. In order to not reveal the secret earlier\nthan needed, Vitya encrypted the answer and obtained the sequence \n    b_1,\n    \n    \u2026, b_n\n using the following rules: \n    b_1 = a_1\n; \n    b_i = a_i\n    \n    \u2295 a_i - 1\n for all \n    i\n from 2 to \n    n\n, where \n    x \n    \u2295\n    y\n is the bitwise XOR of \n    x\n and \n    y\n. It is easy to see that the\noriginal sequence can be obtained using the rule \n    a_i = b_1 \n    \u2295\n    \u2026\n    \u2295 b_i\n. However, some time later Vitya discovered that the\nintegers \n    b_i\n in the cypher got shuffled, and it can happen that when\ndecrypted using the rule mentioned above, it can produce a sequence that is\nnot increasing. In order to save his reputation in the scientific community,\nVasya decided to find some permutation of integers \n    b_i\n so that the\nsequence \n    a_i = b_1 \n    \u2295\n    \u2026\n    \u2295 b_i\n is strictly\nincreasing. Help him find such a permutation or determine that it is\nimpossible. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    b_1,\n    \n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i < 2^60\n). Output If there are no valid\npermutations, print a single line containing \"No\". Otherwise in the first line\nprint the word \"Yes\", and in the second line print integers \n    b'_1, \n    \u2026,\n    b'_n\n \u2014 a valid permutation of integers \n    b_i\n. The unordered multisets\n\n    b_1, \n    \u2026, b_n\n and \n    b'_1, \n    \u2026, b'_n\n\nshould be equal, i. e. for each integer \n    x\n the number of occurrences of\n\n    x\n in the first multiset should be equal to the number of occurrences of\n\n    x\n in the second multiset. Apart from this, the sequence \n    a_i = b'_1\n    \n    \u2295\n    \u2026\n    \u2295 b'_i\n should be strictly increasing. If there are\nmultiple answers, print any of them. Examples Input 3 1 2 3 Output No Input 6\n4 7 7 12 31 61 Output Yes 4 12 7 31 7 61 Note In the first example no\npermutation is valid. In the second example the given answer lead to the\nsequence \n    a_1 = 4\n, \n    a_2 = 8\n, \n    a_3 = 15\n, \n    a_4 = 16\n, \n    a_5\n    = 23\n, \n    a_6 = 42\n.\n\n",
