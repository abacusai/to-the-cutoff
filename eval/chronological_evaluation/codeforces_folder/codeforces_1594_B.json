        "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher\n(Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only\nspecial numbers. Let's call a positive number special if it can be written as\na sum of different non-negative powers of \n    n\n. For example, for \n    n =\n    4\n number \n    17\n is special, because it can be written as \n    4^0 + 4^2 = 1\n    + 16 = 17\n, but \n    9\n is not. Theofanis asks you to help him find the\n\n    k\n-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this\nnumber may be too large, output it modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The first and only line of each test case contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^9\n).\nOutput For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the \n    k\n-th special number\nin increasing order modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Example Input 3 3 4 2 12 105 564\nOutput 9 12 3595374 Note For \n    n = 3\n the sequence is \n    [1,3,4,9...]\n\n\n",
