        "description": "Riley is a very bad boy, but at the same time, he is a yo-yo master. So, he\ndecided to use his yo-yo skills to annoy his friend Anton. Anton's room can be\nrepresented as a grid with \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n columns. Let \n    (i, j)\n\ndenote the cell in row \n    i\n and column \n    j\n. Anton is currently standing\nat position \n    (i, j)\n in his room. To annoy Anton, Riley decided to throw\nexactly two yo-yos in cells of the room (they can be in the same cell).\nBecause Anton doesn't like yo-yos thrown on the floor, he has to pick up both\nof them and return back to the initial position. The distance travelled by\nAnton is the shortest path that goes through the positions of both yo-yos and\nreturns back to \n    (i, j)\n by travelling only to adjacent by side cells.\nThat is, if he is in cell \n    (x, y)\n then he can travel to the cells \n    (x +\n    1, y)\n, \n    (x - 1, y)\n, \n    (x, y + 1)\n and \n    (x, y - 1)\n in one step\n(if a cell with those coordinates exists). Riley is wondering where he should\nthrow these two yo-yos so that the distance travelled by Anton is maximized.\nBut because he is very busy, he asked you to tell him. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The only line of each test case\ncontains four integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, \n    i\n, \n    j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 i\n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 j\n    \u2264 m\n) \u2014 the dimensions\nof the room, and the cell at which Anton is currently standing. Output For\neach test case, print four integers \n    x_1\n, \n    y_1\n, \n    x_2\n, \n    y_2\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_1, x_2 \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 y_1, y_2\n    \u2264 m\n) \u2014 the\ncoordinates of where the two yo-yos should be thrown. They will be thrown at\ncoordinates \n    (x_1,y_1)\n and \n    (x_2,y_2)\n. If there are multiple\nanswers, you may print any.
