        "description": "Berland regional ICPC contest has just ended. There were \n    m\n participants\nnumbered from \n    1\n to \n    m\n, who competed on a problemset of \n    n\n\nproblems numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Now the editorial is about to take\nplace. There are two problem authors, each of them is going to tell the\ntutorial to exactly \n    k\n consecutive tasks of the problemset. The authors\nchoose the segment of \n    k\n consecutive tasks for themselves independently\nof each other. The segments can coincide, intersect or not intersect at all.\nThe \n    i\n-th participant is interested in listening to the tutorial of all\nconsecutive tasks from \n    l_i\n to \n    r_i\n. Each participant always chooses\nto listen to only the problem author that tells the tutorials to the maximum\nnumber of tasks he is interested in. Let this maximum number be \n    a_i\n. No\nparticipant can listen to both of the authors, even if their segments don't\nintersect. The authors want to choose the segments of \n    k\n consecutive\ntasks for themselves in such a way that the sum of \n    a_i\n over all\nparticipants is maximized. Input The first line contains three integers \n    n,\n    m\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 2000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\nthe number of problems, the number of participants and the length of the\nsegment of tasks each of the problem authors plans to tell the tutorial to.\nThe \n    i\n-th of the next \n    m\n lines contains two integers \n    l_i\n and\n\n    r_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the segment of tasks the\n\n    i\n-th participant is interested in listening to the tutorial to. Output\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum sum of \n    a_i\n over all participants.\nExamples Input 10 5 3 1 3 2 4 6 9 6 9 1 8 Output 14 Input 10 3 3 2 4 4 6 3 5\nOutput 8 Input 4 4 1 3 3 1 1 2 2 4 4 Output 2 Input 5 4 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5\nOutput 8 Note In the first example the first author can tell the tutorial to\nproblems from \n    1\n to \n    3\n and the second one \u2014 from \n    6\n to \n    8\n.\nThat way the sequence of \n    a_i\n will be \n    [3, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n. Notice that\nthe last participant can't listen to both author, he only chooses the one that\ntells the maximum number of problems he's interested in. In the second example\nthe first one can tell problems \n    2\n to \n    4\n, the second one \u2014 \n    4\n\nto \n    6\n. In the third example the first one can tell problems \n    1\n to\n\n    1\n, the second one \u2014 \n    2\n to \n    2\n. Or \n    4\n to \n    4\n and\n\n    3\n to \n    3\n. Every pair of different problems will get the same sum of\n\n    2\n. In the fourth example the first one can tell problems \n    1\n to\n\n    5\n, the second one \u2014 \n    1\n to \n    5\n as well.\n\n",
