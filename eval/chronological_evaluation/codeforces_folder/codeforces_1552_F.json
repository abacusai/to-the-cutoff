        "description": "An ant moves on the real line with constant speed of \n    1\n unit per second.\nIt starts at \n    0\n and always moves to the right (so its position increases\nby \n    1\n each second). There are \n    n\n portals, the \n    i\n-th of which is\nlocated at position \n    x_i\n and teleports to position \n    y_i < x_i\n. Each\nportal can be either active or inactive. The initial state of the \n    i\n-th\nportal is determined by \n    s_i\n: if \n    s_i=0\n then the \n    i\n-th portal\nis initially inactive, if \n    s_i=1\n then the \n    i\n-th portal is initially\nactive. When the ant travels through a portal (i.e., when its position\ncoincides with the position of a portal): if the portal is inactive, it\nbecomes active (in this case the path of the ant is not affected); if the\nportal is active, it becomes inactive and the ant is instantly teleported to\nthe position \n    y_i\n, where it keeps on moving as normal. How long (from the\ninstant it starts moving) does it take for the ant to reach the position\n\n    x_n + 1\n? It can be shown that this happens in a finite amount of time.\nSince the answer may be very large, compute it modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n.\nInput The first line contains the integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of portals. The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    n\n lines\ncontains three integers \n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n and \n    s_i\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 y_i <\n    x_i\n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    s_i\n    \u2208\n    \n    0,1\n) \u2014 the position of the\n\n    i\n-th portal, the position where the ant is teleported when it travels\nthrough the \n    i\n-th portal (if it is active), and the initial state of the\n\n    i\n-th portal. The positions of the portals are strictly increasing, that\nis \n    x_1<x_2<\n    \u22ef<x_n\n. It is guaranteed that the \n    2n\n integers\n\n    x_1, \n      x_2, \n     \n    \u2026, \n      x_n, \n      y_1, \n      y_2, \n     \n    \u2026,\n    \n      y_n\n are all distinct. Output Output the amount of time elapsed, in\nseconds, from the instant the ant starts moving to the instant it reaches the\nposition \n    x_n+1\n. Since the answer may be very large, output it modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353\n.
