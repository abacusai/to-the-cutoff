        "description": "Kotlin Heroes competition is nearing completion. This time \n    n\n programmers\ntook part in the competition. Now organizers are thinking how to entertain\nspectators as well. One of the possibilities is holding sweepstakes. So for\nnow they decided to conduct a survey among spectators. In total, organizers\nasked \n    m\n viewers two questions: Who will take the first place? Who will\ntake the last place? After receiving answers, organizers ranked all spectators\nbased on the number of programmers they guessed right. Suppose, there are\n\n    c_2\n viewers who guessed right both first and last place, \n    c_1\n\nviewers who guessed either first or last place right and \n    c_0\n viewers who\ndidn't guess at all. All \n    c_2\n viewers will get rank \n    1\n, all viewers\nwith one right answer will get rank \n    c_2 + 1\n and all remaining viewers \u2014\nrank \n    c_2 + c_1 + 1\n. You were one of the interviewed spectators. Also, as\none of the organizers, you have access to survey results, but not to\ncompetition results. Calculate, what is the worst rank you can possibly get\naccording to organizers' ranking system? Input The first line contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of programmers participating in the competition\nand the number of surveyed spectators. Next \n    m\n lines contain answers of\nspectators. The \n    i\n-th line contains two integers \n    f_i\n and \n    l_i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 f_i, l_i \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    f_i \n     l_i\n) \u2014 the indices of\nprogrammers who will take the first and last places in opinion of the\n\n    i\n-th viewer. For simplicity, you are the first among spectators, so your\nanswers are \n    f_1\n and \n    l_1\n. Output Print the single integer \u2014 the\nworst rank among spectators you can possibly get according to organizers'\nranking system (bigger rank \u2014 worse, of course). Examples Input 2 3 1 2 2 1 2\n1 Output 3 Input 3 6 3 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 3 2 3 1 Output 4 Note In the first\nexample, if the second programmer takes first place, while the first\nprogrammer takes last place, you'll have \n    0\n right answers while the other\ntwo spectators \u2014 \n    2\n right answers. That's why your rank (in the worst\ncase) will be \n    c_2 + c_1 + 1\n \n    =\n \n    2 + 0 + 1 = 3\n. In the second\nexample, for example, if the third programmer takes the first place and the\nsecond programmer takes the last place, then you'll have \n    1\n right answer.\nThe spectators \n    2\n, \n    4\n and \n    5\n will have \n    2\n right answers,\nspectator \n    6\n \u2014 \n    1\n right answer and spectator \n    3\n \u2014 \n    0\n right\nanswers. As a result, your rank will be equal to \n    c_2 + 1\n \n    =\n \n    3 +\n    1 = 4\n. (Note that spectator \n    6\n will have the same rank \n    4\n).\n\n",
