        "description": "A has a string consisting of some number of lowercase English letters 'a'. He\ngives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of\nthis string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have\nmade sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the\nstring. B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c'\nto the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the\nnumber of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the\nnumber of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters\n'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b'\nat the same time. You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it\nis possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to\nobtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\nInput The first and only line consists of a string \n    S\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 |S|\n    \n    \u2264 5\n     000\n). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the\nlowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'. Output Print \"YES\" or \"NO\", according\nto the condition. Examples Input aaabccc Output YES Input bbacc Output NO\nInput aabc Output YES Note Consider first example: the number of 'c' is equal\nto the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is\nequal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct. Consider third\nexample: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\n",
