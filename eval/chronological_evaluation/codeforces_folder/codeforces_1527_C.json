        "name": "Sequence Pair Weight",
        "description": "The weight of a sequence is defined as the number of unordered pairs of\nindexes \n    (i,j)\n (here \n    i \n     j\n) with same value (\n    a_i =\n    a_j\n). For example, the weight of sequence \n    a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]\n is\n\n    4\n. The set of unordered pairs of indexes with same value are \n    (1,\n    2)\n, \n    (1, 5)\n, \n    (2, 5)\n, and \n    (3, 4)\n. You are given a sequence\n\n    a\n of \n    n\n integers. Print the sum of the weight of all subsegments of\n\n    a\n. A sequence \n    b\n is a subsegment of a sequence \n    a\n if \n    b\n\ncan be obtained from \n    a\n by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all)\nelements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from\nthe end. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains\nthe number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n). Description of\nthe test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The second line of each test\ncase contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print a single integer\n\u2014 the sum of the weight of all subsegments of \n    a\n. Example Input 2 4 1 2 1\n1 4 1 2 3 4 Output 6 0 Note In test case \n    1\n, all possible subsegments of\nsequence \n    [1, 2, 1, 1]\n having size more than \n    1\n are: \n    [1, 2]\n\nhaving \n    0\n valid unordered pairs; \n    [2, 1]\n having \n    0\n valid\nunordered pairs; \n    [1, 1]\n having \n    1\n valid unordered pair; \n    [1, 2,\n    1]\n having \n    1\n valid unordered pairs; \n    [2, 1, 1]\n having \n    1\n\nvalid unordered pair; \n    [1, 2, 1, 1]\n having \n    3\n valid unordered pairs.\nAnswer is \n    6\n. In test case \n    2\n, all elements of the sequence are\ndistinct. So, there is no valid unordered pair with the same value for any\nsubarray. Answer is \n    0\n.\n\n",
