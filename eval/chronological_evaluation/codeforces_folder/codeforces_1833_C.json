        "description": "Vlad was given an array \n    a\n of \n    n\n positive integers. Now he wants to\nbuild a beautiful array \n    b\n of length \n    n\n from it. Vlad considers an\narray beautiful if all the numbers in it are positive and have the same\nparity. That is, all numbers in the beautiful array are greater than zero and\nare either all even or all odd. To build the array \n    b\n, Vlad can assign\neach \n    b_i\n either the value \n    a_i\n or \n    a_i - a_j\n, where any\n\n    j\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n can be chosen. To avoid trying to do the\nimpossible, Vlad asks you to determine whether it is possible to build a\nbeautiful array \n    b\n of length \n    n\n using his array \n    a\n. Input The\nfirst line of input contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases. The\nfirst line of each case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the array \n    a\n. The second line of each\ncase contains \n    n\n positive integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the elements of the array \n    a\n. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n over all cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n.\nOutput Output \n    t\n strings, each of which is the answer to the\ncorresponding test case. As the answer, output \"YES\" if Vlad can build a\nbeautiful array \n    b\n, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any\ncase (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be\nrecognized as a positive answer).
