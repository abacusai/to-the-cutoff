        "description": "We are definitely not going to bother you with another generic story when\nAlice finds about an array or when Alice and Bob play some stupid game. This\ntime you'll get a simple, plain text. First, let us define several things. We\ndefine function \n    F\n on the array \n    A\n such that \n    F(i, 1) = A[i]\n\nand \n    F(i, m) = A[F(i, m - 1)]\n for \n    m > 1\n. In other words, value\n\n    F(i, m)\n represents composition \n    A[...A[i]]\n applied \n    m\n times.\nYou are given an array of length \n    N\n with non-negative integers. You are\nexpected to give an answer on \n    Q\n queries. Each query consists of two\nnumbers \u2013 \n    m\n and \n    y\n. For each query determine how many \n    x\n exist\nsuch that \n    F(x,m) = y\n. Input The first line contains one integer \n    N\n\n\n    (1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5)\n \u2013 the size of the array \n    A\n. The\nnext line contains \n    N\n non-negative integers \u2013 the array \n    A\n itself\n\n    (1 \n    \u2264 A_i \n    \u2264 N)\n. The next line contains one integer \n    Q\n\n\n    (1 \n    \u2264 Q \n    \u2264 10^5)\n \u2013 the number of queries. Each of the next\n\n    Q\n lines contain two integers \n    m\n and \n    y\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264\n    10^18, 1\n    \u2264 y \n    \u2264 N)\n. Output Output exactly \n    Q\n lines with a\nsingle integer in each that represent the solution. Output the solutions in\nthe order the queries were asked in. Example Input 10 2 3 1 5 6 4 2 10 7 7 5\n10 1 5 7 10 6 1 1 10 8 Output 3 0 1 1 0 Note For the first query we can notice\nthat \n    F(3, 10) = 1,\n     F(9, 10) = 1\n and \n    F(10, 10) = 1\n. For the\nsecond query no \n    x\n satisfies condition \n    F(x, 5) = 7\n. For the third\nquery \n    F(5, 10) = 6\n holds. For the fourth query \n    F(3, 1) = 1.\n For\nthe fifth query no \n    x\n satisfies condition \n    F(x, 10) = 8\n.\n\n",
