        "description": "Flatland is inhabited by pixels of three colors: red, green and blue. We know\nthat if two pixels of different colors meet in a violent fight, only one of\nthem survives the fight (that is, the total number of pixels decreases by\none). Besides, if pixels of colors x and y (x \u2260 y) meet in a violent fight,\nthen the pixel that survives the fight immediately changes its color to z (z \u2260\nx; z \u2260 y). Pixels of the same color are friends, so they don't fight. The King\nof Flatland knows that his land will be peaceful and prosperous when the\npixels are of the same color. For each of the three colors you know the number\nof pixels of this color that inhabit Flatland. Help the king and determine\nwhether fights can bring peace and prosperity to the country and if it is\npossible, find the minimum number of fights needed to make the land peaceful\nand prosperous. Input The first line contains three space-separated integers\na, b and c (0 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 2^31; a + b + c > 0) \u2014 the number of red, green and\nblue pixels, correspondingly. Output Print a single number \u2014 the minimum\nnumber of pixel fights before the country becomes peaceful and prosperous. If\nmaking the country peaceful and prosperous is impossible, print -1. Examples\nInput 1 1 1 Output 1 Input 3 1 0 Output 3 Note In the first test sample the\ncountry needs only one fight to achieve peace and prosperity. Besides, it can\nbe any fight whatsoever. For example, let's assume that the green and the blue\npixels fight, then the surviving pixel will be red. As a result, after the\nfight there are two red pixels. There won't be other pixels. In the second\nsample the following sequence of fights is possible: red and blue, green and\nred, red and blue. As a result, after all fights there is one green pixel\nleft.\n\n",
