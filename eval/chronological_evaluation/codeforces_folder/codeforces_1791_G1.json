        "description": "The only difference between the easy and hard versions are the locations you\ncan teleport to. Consider the points \n    0, 1, \n    \u2026, n\n on the number\nline. There is a teleporter located on each of the points \n    1, 2, \n    \u2026,\n    n\n. At point \n    i\n, you can do the following: Move left one unit: it costs\n\n    1\n coin. Move right one unit: it costs \n    1\n coin. Use a teleporter at\npoint \n    i\n, if it exists: it costs \n    a_i\n coins. As a result, you\nteleport to point \n    0\n. Once you use a teleporter, you can't use it again.\nYou have \n    c\n coins, and you start at point \n    0\n. What's the most number\nof teleporters you can use? Input The input consists of multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow. The first\nline of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    n \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b710^5\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 c \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the length of the\narray and the number of coins you have respectively. The following line\ncontains \n    n\n space-separated integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the costs to use the teleporters. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For each test case, output the maximum number of\nteleporters you can use. Example Input 10 5 6 1 1 1 1 1 8 32 100 52 13 6 9 4\n100 35 1 1 5 4 5 4 3 2 1 5 9 2 3 1 4 1 5 8 2 3 1 4 1 4 3 2 3 4 1 4 9 5 4 3 3 2\n14 7 5 5 600000000 500000000 400000000 300000000 200000000 100000000 Output 2\n2 0 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 Note In the first test case, you can move one unit to the\nright, use the teleporter at index \n    1\n and teleport to point \n    0\n, move\ntwo units to the right and use the teleporter at index \n    2\n. You are left\nwith \n    6-1-1-2-1 = 1\n coins you don't have enough coins to use another\nteleporter. You have used two teleporters, so the answer is two. In the second\ntest case, you go four units to the right and use the teleporter to go to\n\n    0\n, then go six units right and use the teleporter at index \n    6\n to go\nto \n    0\n. The total cost will be \n    4+6+6+4 = 20\n. You are left with\n\n    12\n coins, but it is not enough to reach any other teleporter and use it\nso the answer is \n    2\n. In the third test case, you don't have enough coins\nto use any teleporter, so the answer is zero.\n\n",
