        "description": "Andrew and Jerry are playing a game with Harry as the scorekeeper. The game\nconsists of three rounds. In each round, Andrew and Jerry draw randomly\nwithout replacement from a jar containing n balls, each labeled with a\ndistinct positive integer. Without looking, they hand their balls to Harry,\nwho awards the point to the player with the larger number and returns the\nballs to the jar. The winner of the game is the one who wins at least two of\nthe three rounds. Andrew wins rounds 1 and 2 while Jerry wins round 3, so\nAndrew wins the game. However, Jerry is unhappy with this system, claiming\nthat he will often lose the match despite having the higher overall total.\nWhat is the probability that the sum of the three balls Jerry drew is strictly\nhigher than the sum of the three balls Andrew drew? Input The first line of\ninput contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of balls in the\njar. The second line contains n integers ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 5000) \u2014 the number\nwritten on the ith ball. It is guaranteed that no two balls have the same\nnumber. Output Print a single real value \u2014 the probability that Jerry has a\nhigher total, given that Andrew wins the first two rounds and Jerry wins the\nthird. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative\nerror does not exceed 10^-6. Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and\nthe answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer\ncorrect, if . Examples Input 2 1 2 Output 0.0000000000 Input 3 1 2 10 Output\n0.0740740741 Note In the first case, there are only two balls. In the first\ntwo rounds, Andrew must have drawn the 2 and Jerry must have drawn the 1, and\nvice versa in the final round. Thus, Andrew's sum is 5 and Jerry's sum is 4,\nso Jerry never has a higher total. In the second case, each game could've had\nthree outcomes \u2014 10 - 2, 10 - 1, or 2 - 1. Jerry has a higher total if and\nonly if Andrew won 2 - 1 in both of the first two rounds, and Jerry drew the\n10 in the last round. This has probability .\n\n",
