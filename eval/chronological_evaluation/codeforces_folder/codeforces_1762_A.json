        "description": "An array \n    b\n is good if the sum of elements of \n    b\n is even. You are\ngiven an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n positive integers. In one\noperation, you can select an index \n    i\n and change \n    a_i := \n    \u230a\n    a_i/2\n    \u230b\n. \n    ^\n    \u2020\n Find the minimum number of\noperations (possibly \n    0\n) needed to make \n    a\n good. It can be proven\nthat it is always possible to make \n    a\n good. \n    ^\n    \u2020\n \n    \u230a\n    x \n    \u230b\n denotes the floor function \u2014 the largest integer less than or\nequal to \n    x\n. For example, \n    \u230a 2.7 \n    \u230b = 2\n, \n    \u230a\n    \u03c0\n    \u230b = 3\n and \n    \u230a 5 \n    \u230b =5\n. Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\nthe test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the length of the array\n\n    a\n. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n space-separated\nintegers \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014\nrepresenting the array \n    a\n. Do note that the sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases is not bounded. Output For each test case, output the minimum number of\noperations needed to make \n    a\n good. Example Input 4 4 1 1 1 1 2 7 4 3 1 2\n4 1 15 Output 0 2 1 4 Note In the first test case, array \n    a\n is already\ngood. In the second test case, we can perform on index \n    2\n twice. After\nthe first operation, array \n    a\n becomes \n    [7,2]\n. After performing on\nindex \n    2\n again, \n    a\n becomes \n    [7,1]\n, which is good. It can be\nproved that it is not possible to make \n    a\n good in less number of\noperations. In the third test case, \n    a\n becomes \n    [0,2,4]\n if we\nperform the operation on index \n    1\n once. As \n    [0,2,4]\n is good, answer\nis \n    1\n. In the fourth test case, we need to perform the operation on index\n\n    1\n four times. After all operations, \n    a\n becomes \n    [0]\n. It can be\nproved that it is not possible to make \n    a\n good in less number of\noperations.\n\n",
