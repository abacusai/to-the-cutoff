        "description": "Rahul and Tina are looking forward to starting their new year at college. As\nthey enter their new classroom, they observe the seats of students are\narranged in a \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n grid. The seat in row \n    r\n and column\n\n    c\n is denoted by \n    (r, c)\n, and the distance between two seats\n\n    (a,b)\n and \n    (c,d)\n is \n    |a-c| + |b-d|\n. As the class president,\nTina has access to exactly \n    k\n buckets of pink paint. The following\nprocess occurs. First, Tina chooses exactly \n    k\n seats in the classroom to\npaint with pink paint. One bucket of paint can paint exactly one seat. After\nTina has painted \n    k\n seats in the previous step, Rahul chooses where he\nsits. He will not choose a seat that has been painted pink due to his hatred\nof the colour pink. After Rahul has chosen his seat, Tina chooses a seat for\nherself. She can choose any of the seats, painted or not, other than the one\nchosen by Rahul. Rahul wants to choose a seat such that he sits as close to\nTina as possible. However, Tina wants to sit as far away from Rahul as\npossible due to some complicated relationship history that we couldn't fit\ninto the statement! Now, Rahul wonders for \n    k = 0, 1, \n    \u2026, n \n    \u00b7 m -\n    1\n, if Tina has \n    k\n buckets of paint, how close can Rahul sit to Tina,\nif both Rahul and Tina are aware of each other's intentions and they both act\nas strategically as possible? Please help satisfy Rahul's curiosity! Input The\ninput consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains two integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u00b7 m \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of seats in the classroom. The sum\nof \n    n \n    \u00b7 m\n across all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output\nFor each test case, output \n    n \n    \u00b7 m\n ordered integers \u2014 the distance\nbetween Rahul and Tina if both of them act optimally for every \n    k \n    \u2208 [0,\n    n \n    \u00b7 m - 1]\n. Example Input 2 4 3 1 2 Output 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 1\n1 Note One possible sequence of choices for the first testcase where Tina has\n\n    k=3\n buckets of paints is as follows. Tina paints the seats at positions\n\n    (1, 2)\n, \n    (2, 2)\n, \n    (3, 2)\n with pink paint. Rahul chooses the\nseat at \n    (3, 1)\n after which Tina chooses to sit at \n    (1, 3)\n.\nTherefore, the distance between Tina and Rahul is \n    |3-1| + |1-3| = 4\n, and\nwe can prove that this is indeed the minimum possible distance under the given\nconstraints. There may be other choices of seats which lead to the same answer\nas well. For \n    k=0\n in the first test case, Rahul can decide to sit at\n\n    (2, 2)\n and Tina can decide to sit at \n    (4, 3)\n so the distance\nbetween them would be \n    |2 - 4| + |2 - 3| = 3\n. Below are pictorial\nrepresentations of the \n    k=3\n and \n    k=0\n cases for the first test case.\nA possible seating arrangement for \n    k=3\n. A possible seating arrangement\nfor \n    k=0\n.\n\n",
