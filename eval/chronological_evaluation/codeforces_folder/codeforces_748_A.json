        "name": "Santa Claus and a Place in a Class",
        "description": "Santa Claus is the first who came to the Christmas Olympiad, and he is going\nto be the first to take his place at a desk! In the classroom there are n\nlanes of m desks each, and there are two working places at each of the desks.\nThe lanes are numbered from 1 to n from the left to the right, the desks in a\nlane are numbered from 1 to m starting from the blackboard. Note that the\nlanes go perpendicularly to the blackboard, not along it (see picture). The\norganizers numbered all the working places from 1 to 2nm. The places are\nnumbered by lanes (i. e. all the places of the first lane go first, then all\nthe places of the second lane, and so on), in a lane the places are numbered\nstarting from the nearest to the blackboard (i. e. from the first desk in the\nlane), at each desk, the place on the left is numbered before the place on the\nright. The picture illustrates the first and the second samples. Santa Clause\nknows that his place has number k. Help him to determine at which lane at\nwhich desk he should sit, and whether his place is on the left or on the\nright! Input The only line contains three integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10\n000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 2nm) \u2014 the number of lanes, the number of desks in each lane and\nthe number of Santa Claus' place. Output Print two integers: the number of\nlane r, the number of desk d, and a character s, which stands for the side of\nthe desk Santa Claus. The character s should be \"L\", if Santa Clause should\nsit on the left, and \"R\" if his place is on the right. Examples Input 4 3 9\nOutput 2 2 L Input 4 3 24 Output 4 3 R Input 2 4 4 Output 1 2 R Note The first\nand the second samples are shown on the picture. The green place corresponds\nto Santa Claus' place in the first example, the blue place corresponds to\nSanta Claus' place in the second example. In the third sample there are two\nlanes with four desks in each, and Santa Claus has the fourth place. Thus, his\nplace is in the first lane at the second desk on the right.\n\n",
