        "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game once again. He is a wizard apprentice, who\nonly knows a single spell. Luckily, this spell can damage the monsters. The\nlevel he's currently on contains \n    n\n monsters. The \n    i\n-th of them\nappears \n    k_i\n seconds after the start of the level and has \n    h_i\n\nhealth points. As an additional constraint, \n    h_i \n    \u2264 k_i\n for all \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n. All \n    k_i\n are different. Monocarp can cast the spell\nat moments which are positive integer amounts of second after the start of the\nlevel: \n    1, 2, 3, \n    \u2026\n The damage of the spell is calculated as\nfollows. If he didn't cast the spell at the previous second, the damage is\n\n    1\n. Otherwise, let the damage at the previous second be \n    x\n. Then he\ncan choose the damage to be either \n    x + 1\n or \n    1\n. A spell uses mana:\ncasting a spell with damage \n    x\n uses \n    x\n mana. Mana doesn't\nregenerate. To kill the \n    i\n-th monster, Monocarp has to cast a spell with\ndamage at least \n    h_i\n at the exact moment the monster appears, which is\n\n    k_i\n. Note that Monocarp can cast the spell even when there is no monster\nat the current second. The mana amount required to cast the spells is the sum\nof mana usages for all cast spells. Calculate the least amount of mana\nrequired for Monocarp to kill all monsters. It can be shown that it's always\npossible to kill all monsters under the constraints of the problem. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014\nthe number of testcases. The first line of the testcase contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of monsters in the\nlevel. The second line of the testcase contains \n    n\n integers \n    k_1 < k_2\n    < \n    \u2026 < k_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of second from\nthe start the \n    i\n-th monster appears at. All \n    k_i\n are different,\n\n    k_i\n are provided in the increasing order. The third line of the testcase\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    h_1, h_2, \n    \u2026, h_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 h_i \n    \u2264\n    k_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the health of the \n    i\n-th monster. The sum of \n    n\n\nover all testcases doesn't exceed \n    10^4\n. Output For each testcase, print\na single integer \u2014 the least amount of mana required for Monocarp to kill all\nmonsters. Example Input 3 1 6 4 2 4 5 2 2 3 5 7 9 2 1 2 Output 10 6 7 Note In\nthe first testcase of the example, Monocarp can cast spells \n    3, 4, 5\n and\n\n    6\n seconds from the start with damages \n    1, 2, 3\n and \n    4\n,\nrespectively. The damage dealt at \n    6\n seconds is \n    4\n, which is indeed\ngreater than or equal to the health of the monster that appears. In the second\ntestcase of the example, Monocarp can cast spells \n    3, 4\n and \n    5\n\nseconds from the start with damages \n    1, 2\n and \n    3\n, respectively. In\nthe third testcase of the example, Monocarp can cast spells \n    4, 5, 7, 8\n\nand \n    9\n seconds from the start with damages \n    1, 2, 1, 1\n and \n    2\n,\nrespectively.\n\n",
