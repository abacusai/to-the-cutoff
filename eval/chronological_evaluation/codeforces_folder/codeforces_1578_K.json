        "description": "The Kingdom of Islands consists of \n    p\n islands. As the king, you rule over\nthe whole kingdom, while each island is ruled over by one or several jarls\nunder your rule. In total, there are \n    n\n jarls under your jurisdiction.\nEach island of the kingdom has its own strong traditions, so jarls that rule\nover the same island support each other and never have conflicts. The\ndownsides of such strength are cultural conflicts between people inhabiting\ndifferent islands. Thus, two jarls that rule over different islands are in\nconflict. However, recent years brought a few changes to traditional relations\nbetween the jarls. To your knowledge, there are exactly \n    k\n pairs of jarls\nsuch that relationships between two jarls in the pair are different from the\ntraditional. That is, if two jarls of the pair you know rule over the same\nisland, these jarls are in conflict. If they rule over different islands, then\nthey overcome cultural disagreement and there is no conflict between them\nanymore. As a true responsible king, you are worried about whether the kingdom\nis close to a major conflict. In order to estimate the current situation, you\nwould like to find the largest possible group of jarls such that every two\njarls in the group are in conflict. Input The first line of the input consists\nof two integers \n    p\n and \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n; \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 p \n    \u2264 10^4\n). The second line consists of \n    n\n integers \n    s_1,\n    s_2, \n    \u2026, s_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 s_i \n    \u2264 p\n). The integer \n    s_i\n\ndenotes that the \n    i\n-th jarl rules over the island number \n    s_i\n. It is\nguaranteed that each island is ruled by at least one jarl. The third line\nconsists of a single integer \n    k\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 20\n). Then \n    k\n\nlines follow. The \n    j\n-th of these lines consists of two distinct integers\n\n    a_j\n and \n    b_j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_j < b_j \n    \u2264 n\n), denoting that the\nrelation between the \n    a_j\n-th jarl and the \n    b_j\n-th jarl differs from\ntraditional. It is guaranteed that no pair of jarls appears twice in this\nlist. Output In the first line print a single integer \n    q\n between \n    1\n\nand \n    n\n \u2014 the largest possible number of jarls in a pairwise conflicting\ngroup. In the second line print \n    q\n distinct integers between \n    1\n and\n\n    n\n \u2014 the numbers of jarls in the group. The numbers of jarls can be\nprinted in any order.
