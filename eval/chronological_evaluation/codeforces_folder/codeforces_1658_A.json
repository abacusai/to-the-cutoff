        "description": "Today, Marin is at a cosplay exhibition and is preparing for a group\nphotoshoot! For the group picture, the cosplayers form a horizontal line. A\ngroup picture is considered beautiful if for every contiguous segment of at\nleast \n    2\n cosplayers, the number of males does not exceed the number of\nfemales (obviously). Currently, the line has \n    n\n cosplayers which can be\ndescribed by a binary string \n    s\n. The \n    i\n-th cosplayer is male if\n\n    s_i = 0\n and female if \n    s_i = 1\n. To ensure that the line is\nbeautiful, you can invite some additional cosplayers (possibly zero) to join\nthe line at any position. You can't remove any cosplayer from the line. Marin\nwants to know the minimum number of cosplayers you need to invite so that the\ngroup picture of all the cosplayers is beautiful. She can't do this on her\nown, so she's asking you for help. Can you help her? Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of cosplayers in the\ninitial line. The second line of each test case contains a binary string\n\n    s\n of length \n    n\n \u2014 describing the cosplayers already in line. Each\ncharacter of the string is either 0 describing a male, or 1 describing a\nfemale. Note that there is no limit on the sum of \n    n\n. Output For each\ntest case, print the minimum number of cosplayers you need to invite so that\nthe group picture of all the cosplayers is beautiful. Example Input 9 3 000 3\n001 3 010 3 011 3 100 3 101 3 110 3 111 19 1010110000100000101 Output 4 2 1 0\n2 0 0 0 17 Note In the first test case, for each pair of adjacent cosplayers,\nyou can invite two female cosplayers to stand in between them. Then, \n    000\n    \n    \u2192 0110110\n. In the third test case, you can invite one female\ncosplayer to stand next to the second cosplayer. Then, \n    010 \n    \u2192\n    0110\n.\n\n",
