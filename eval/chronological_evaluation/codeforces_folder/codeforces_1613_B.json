        "description": "You are given a sequence \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n consisting of \n    n\n\npairwise distinct positive integers. Find \n    \u230a\n    n/2\n    \n    \u230b\n different pairs of integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n such\nthat: \n    x \n    \u2260 y\n; \n    x\n and \n    y\n appear in \n    a\n; \n    x\u00a0mod\u00a0y\n\ndoesn't appear in \n    a\n. Note that some \n    x\n or \n    y\n can belong to\nmultiple pairs. \n    \u230a x \n    \u230b\n denotes the floor function \u2014 the\nlargest integer less than or equal to \n    x\n. \n    x\u00a0mod\u00a0y\n denotes the\nremainder from dividing \n    x\n by \n    y\n. If there are multiple solutions,\nprint any of them. It can be shown that at least one solution always exists.\nInput The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a\nsingle integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of\nthe sequence. The second line of each testcase contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n). All numbers in\nthe sequence are pairwise distinct. The sum of \n    n\n over all testcases\ndoesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output The answer for each testcase\nshould contain \n    \u230a\n    n/2\n    \n    \u230b\n different\npairs of integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n such that \n    x \n    \u2260 y\n, \n    x\n and\n\n    y\n appear in \n    a\n and \n    x\u00a0mod\u00a0y\n doesn't appear in \n    a\n. Print\nthe pairs one after another. You can print the pairs in any order. However,\nthe order of numbers in the pair should be exactly such that the first number\nis \n    x\n and the second number is \n    y\n. All pairs should be pairwise\ndistinct. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. Example Input 4\n2 1 4 4 2 8 3 4 5 3 8 5 9 7 6 2 7 5 3 4 8 Output 4 1 8 2 8 4 9 5 7 5 8 7 4 3 5\n2 Note In the first testcase there are only two pairs: \n    (1, 4)\n and \n    (4,\n    1)\n. \n    \u230a\n    2/2\n    \n    \u230b=1\n, so we have to\nfind one pair. \n    1\u00a0mod\u00a04=1\n, and \n    1\n appears in \n    a\n, so that pair\nis invalid. Thus, the only possible answer is a pair \n    (4, 1)\n. In the\nsecond testcase, we chose pairs \n    8\u00a0mod\u00a02=0\n and \n    8\u00a0mod\u00a04=0\n. \n    0\n\ndoesn't appear in \n    a\n, so that answer is valid. There are multiple\npossible answers for that testcase. In the third testcase, the chosen pairs\nare \n    9\u00a0mod\u00a05=4\n and \n    7\u00a0mod\u00a05=2\n. Neither \n    4\n, nor \n    2\n, appears\nin \n    a\n, so that answer is valid.\n\n",
