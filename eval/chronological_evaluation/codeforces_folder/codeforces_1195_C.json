        "description": "Finally, a basketball court has been opened in SIS, so Demid has decided to\nhold a basketball exercise session. \n    2 \n    \u00b7 n\n students have come to\nDemid's exercise session, and he lined up them into two rows of the same size\n(there are exactly \n    n\n people in each row). Students are numbered from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n in each row in order from left to right. Now Demid wants to\nchoose a team to play basketball. He will choose players from left to right,\nand the index of each chosen player (excluding the first one taken) will be\nstrictly greater than the index of the previously chosen player. To avoid\ngiving preference to one of the rows, Demid chooses students in such a way\nthat no consecutive chosen students belong to the same row. The first student\ncan be chosen among all \n    2n\n students (there are no additional\nconstraints), and a team can consist of any number of students. Demid thinks,\nthat in order to compose a perfect team, he should choose students in such a\nway, that the total height of all chosen students is maximum possible. Help\nDemid to find the maximum possible total height of players in a team he can\nchoose. Input The first line of the input contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of students in each row. The second\nline of the input contains \n    n\n integers \n    h_1, 1, h_1, 2, \n    \u2026,\n    h_1, n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 h_1, i\n    \u2264 10^9\n), where \n    h_1, i\n is the\nheight of the \n    i\n-th student in the first row. The third line of the input\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    h_2, 1, h_2, 2, \n    \u2026, h_2, n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 h_2, i\n    \u2264 10^9\n), where \n    h_2, i\n is the height of the\n\n    i\n-th student in the second row. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the\nmaximum possible total height of players in a team Demid can choose. Examples\nInput 5 9 3 5 7 3 5 8 1 4 5 Output 29 Input 3 1 2 9 10 1 1 Output 19 Input 1 7\n4 Output 7 Note In the first example Demid can choose the following team as\nfollows: In the second example Demid can choose the following team as follows:\n\n",
