        "description": "We say an infinite sequence \n    a_0, a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026\n is non-\nincreasing if and only if for all \n    i\n    \u2265 0\n, \n    a_i \n    \u2265 a_i+1\n.\nThere is an infinite right and down grid. The upper-left cell has coordinates\n\n    (0,0)\n. Rows are numbered \n    0\n to infinity from top to bottom, columns\nare numbered from \n    0\n to infinity from left to right. There is also a non-\nincreasing infinite sequence \n    a_0, a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026\n. You are given\n\n    a_0\n, \n    a_1\n, \n    \u2026\n, \n    a_n\n; for all \n    i>n\n,\n\n    a_i=0\n. For every pair of \n    x\n, \n    y\n, the cell with coordinates\n\n    (x,y)\n (which is located at the intersection of \n    x\n-th row and\n\n    y\n-th column) is white if \n    y<a_x\n and black otherwise. Initially\nthere is one doll named Jina on \n    (0,0)\n. You can do the following\noperation. Select one doll on \n    (x,y)\n. Remove it and place a doll on\n\n    (x,y+1)\n and place a doll on \n    (x+1,y)\n. Note that multiple dolls can\nbe present at a cell at the same time; in one operation, you remove only one.\nYour goal is to make all white cells contain \n    0\n dolls. What's the minimum\nnumber of operations needed to achieve the goal? Print the answer modulo\n\n    10^9+7\n. Input The first line of input contains one integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The second line of input contains\n\n    n+1\n integers \n    a_0,a_1,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    0\n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n). It is guaranteed that the sequence \n    a\n is non-increasing. Output\nPrint one integer \u2014 the answer to the problem, modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Examples\nInput 2 2 2 0 Output 5 Input 10 12 11 8 8 6 6 6 5 3 2 1 Output 2596 Note\nConsider the first example. In the given grid, cells\n\n    (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\n are white, and all other cells are black. Let us\nuse triples to describe the grid: triple \n    (x,y,z)\n means that there are\n\n    z\n dolls placed on cell \n    (x,y)\n. Initially the state of the grid is\n\n    (0,0,1)\n. One of the optimal sequence of operations is as follows: Do the\noperation with \n    (0,0)\n. Now the state of the grid is\n\n    (1,0,1),(0,1,1)\n. Do the operation with \n    (0,1)\n. Now the state of the\ngrid is \n    (1,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,2,1)\n. Do the operation with \n    (1,0)\n. Now\nthe state of the grid is \n    (1,1,2),(0,2,1),(2,0,1)\n. Do the operation with\n\n    (1,1)\n. Now the state of the grid is\n\n    (1,1,1),(0,2,1),(2,0,1),(1,2,1),(2,1,1)\n. Do the operation with\n\n    (1,1)\n. Now the state of the grid is\n\n    (0,2,1),(2,0,1),(1,2,2),(2,1,2)\n. Now all white cells contain \n    0\n\ndolls, so we have achieved the goal with \n    5\n operations.\n\n",
