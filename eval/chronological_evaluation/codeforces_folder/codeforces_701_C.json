It is possible to enter each\nflat from the street. It is possible to go out from each flat. Also, each flat\nis connected with the flat to the left and the flat to the right. Flat number\n1 is only connected with the flat number 2 and the flat number n is only\nconnected with the flat number n - 1. There is exactly one Pokemon of some\ntype in each of these flats. Sergei B. asked residents of the house to let him\nenter their flats in order to catch Pokemons. After consulting the residents\nof the house decided to let Sergei B. enter one flat from the street, visit\nseveral flats and then go out from some flat. But they won't let him visit the\nsame flat more than once. Sergei B. was very pleased, and now he wants to\nvisit as few flats as possible in order to collect Pokemons of all types that\nappear in this house. Your task is to help him and determine this minimum\nnumber of flats he has to visit. Input The first line contains the integer n\n(1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of flats in the house. The second line contains\nthe row s with the length n, it consists of uppercase and lowercase letters of\nEnglish alphabet, the i-th letter equals the type of Pokemon, which is in the\nflat number i. Output Print the minimum number of flats which Sergei B. should\nvisit in order to catch Pokemons of all types which there are in the house.\nExamples Input 3 AaA Output 2 Input 7 bcAAcbc Output 3 Input 6 aaBCCe Output 5\nNote In the first test Sergei B. can begin, for example, from the flat number\n1 and end in the flat number 2. In the second test Sergei B. can begin, for\nexample, from the flat number 4 and end in the flat number 6. In the third\ntest Sergei B. must begin from the flat number 2 and end in the flat number 6.\n\n",
