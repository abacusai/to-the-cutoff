        "description": "A new agent called Killjoy invented a virus COVID-2069 that infects accounts\non Codeforces. Each account has a rating, described by an integer (it can\npossibly be negative or very large). Killjoy's account is already infected and\nhas a rating equal to \n    x\n. Its rating is constant. There are \n    n\n\naccounts except hers, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. The \n    i\n-th\naccount's initial rating is \n    a_i\n. Any infected account (initially the\nonly infected account is Killjoy's) instantly infects any uninfected account\nif their ratings are equal. This can happen at the beginning (before any\nrating changes) and after each contest. If an account is infected, it can not\nbe healed. Contests are regularly held on Codeforces. In each contest, any of\nthese \n    n\n accounts (including infected ones) can participate. Killjoy\ncan't participate. After each contest ratings are changed this way: each\nparticipant's rating is changed by an integer, but the sum of all changes must\nbe equal to zero. New ratings can be any integer. Find out the minimal number\nof contests needed to infect all accounts. You can choose which accounts will\nparticipate in each contest and how the ratings will change. It can be proven\nthat all accounts can be infected in some finite number of contests. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100)\n \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. The next \n    2t\n lines contain the descriptions of all\ntest cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    x\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^3\n, \n    -4000 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 4000\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of accounts on Codeforces and the rating of Killjoy's account. The\nsecond line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n \n    (-4000 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 4000)\n \u2014 the ratings of other accounts.\nOutput For each test case output the minimal number of contests needed to\ninfect all accounts. Example Input 3 2 69 68 70 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 9 38 -21 83 50\n-59 -77 15 -71 -78 20 Output 1 0 2 Note In the first test case it's possible\nto make all ratings equal to \n    69\n. First account's rating will increase by\n\n    1\n, and second account's rating will decrease by \n    1\n, so the sum of\nall changes will be equal to zero. In the second test case all accounts will\nbe instantly infected, because all ratings (including Killjoy's account's\nrating) are equal to \n    4\n.\n\n",
