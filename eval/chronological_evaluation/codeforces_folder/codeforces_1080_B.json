        "description": "Little girl Margarita is a big fan of competitive programming. She especially\nloves problems about arrays and queries on them. Recently, she was presented\nwith an array \n    a\n of the size of \n    10^9\n elements that is filled as\nfollows: \n    a_1 = -1\n \n    a_2 = 2\n \n    a_3 = -3\n \n    a_4 = 4\n \n    a_5 =\n    -5\n And so on ... That is, the value of the \n    i\n-th element of the array\n\n    a\n is calculated using the formula \n    a_i = i \n    \u00b7 (-1)^i\n. She\nimmediately came up with \n    q\n queries on this array. Each query is\ndescribed with two numbers: \n    l\n and \n    r\n. The answer to a query is the\nsum of all the elements of the array at positions from \n    l\n to \n    r\n\ninclusive. Margarita really wants to know the answer to each of the requests.\nShe doesn't want to count all this manually, but unfortunately, she couldn't\nwrite the program that solves the problem either. She has turned to you \u2014 the\nbest programmer. Help her find the answers! Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of the\nqueries. Each of the next \n    q\n lines contains two integers \n    l\n and\n\n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the descriptions of the\nqueries. Output Print \n    q\n lines, each containing one number \u2014 the answer\nto the query. Example Input 5 1 3 2 5 5 5 4 4 2 3 Output -2 -2 -5 4 -1 Note In\nthe first query, you need to find the sum of the elements of the array from\nposition \n    1\n to position \n    3\n. The sum is equal to \n    a_1 + a_2 + a_3 =\n    -1 + 2 -3 = -2\n. In the second query, you need to find the sum of the\nelements of the array from position \n    2\n to position \n    5\n. The sum is\nequal to \n    a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 2 -3 + 4 - 5 = -2\n. In the third query,\nyou need to find the sum of the elements of the array from position \n    5\n to\nposition \n    5\n. The sum is equal to \n    a_5 = -5\n. In the fourth query, you\nneed to find the sum of the elements of the array from position \n    4\n to\nposition \n    4\n. The sum is equal to \n    a_4 = 4\n. In the fifth query, you\nneed to find the sum of the elements of the array from position \n    2\n to\nposition \n    3\n. The sum is equal to \n    a_2 + a_3 = 2 - 3 = -1\n.\n\n",
