        "description": "You are given two positive integers \n    n\n and \n    s\n. Find the maximum\npossible median of an array of \n    n\n non-negative integers (not necessarily\ndistinct), such that the sum of its elements is equal to \n    s\n. A median of\nan array of integers of length \n    m\n is the number standing on the\n\n    \u2308\n    m/2\n    \u2309\n-th (rounding up) position in the non-\ndecreasing ordering of its elements. Positions are numbered starting from\n\n    1\n. For example, a median of the array \n    [20,40,20,50,50,30]\n is the\n\n    \u2308\n    m/2\n    \u2309\n-th element of \n    [20,20,30,40,50,50]\n,\nso it is \n    30\n. There exist other definitions of the median, but in this\nproblem we use the described definition. Input The input consists of multiple\ntest cases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases\nfollows. Each test case contains a single line with two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, s \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the length of the array and the\nrequired sum of the elements. Output For each test case print a single integer\n\u2014 the maximum possible median.
