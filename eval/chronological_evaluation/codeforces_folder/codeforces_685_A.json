        "name": "Robbers' watch",
        "description": "Robbers, who attacked the Gerda's cab, are very successful in covering from\nthe kingdom police. To make the goal of catching them even harder, they use\ntheir own watches. First, as they know that kingdom police is bad at math,\nrobbers use the positional numeral system with base 7. Second, they divide one\nday in n hours, and each hour in m minutes. Personal watches of each robber\nare divided in two parts: first of them has the smallest possible number of\nplaces that is necessary to display any integer from 0 to n - 1, while the\nsecond has the smallest possible number of places that is necessary to display\nany integer from 0 to m - 1. Finally, if some value of hours or minutes can be\ndisplayed using less number of places in base 7 than this watches have, the\nrequired number of zeroes is added at the beginning of notation. Note that to\ndisplay number 0 section of the watches is required to have at least one\nplace. Little robber wants to know the number of moments of time (particular\nvalues of hours and minutes), such that all digits displayed on the watches\nare distinct. Help her calculate this number. Input The first line of the\ninput contains two integers, given in the decimal notation, n and m (1 \u2264 n, m\n\u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of hours in one day and the number of minutes in one\nhour, respectively. Output Print one integer in decimal notation \u2014 the number\nof different pairs of hour and minute, such that all digits displayed on the\nwatches are distinct. Examples Input 2 3 Output 4 Input 8 2 Output 5 Note In\nthe first sample, possible pairs are: (0: 1), (0: 2), (1: 0), (1: 2). In the\nsecond sample, possible pairs are: (02: 1), (03: 1), (04: 1), (05: 1), (06:\n1).\n\n",
