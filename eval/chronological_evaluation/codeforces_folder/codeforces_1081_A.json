        "description": "Chouti was doing a competitive programming competition. However, after having\nall the problems accepted, he got bored and decided to invent some small\ngames. He came up with the following game. The player has a positive integer\n\n    n\n. Initially the value of \n    n\n equals to \n    v\n and the player is\nable to do the following operation as many times as the player want (possibly\nzero): choose a positive integer \n    x\n that \n    x<n\n and \n    x\n is not a\ndivisor of \n    n\n, then subtract \n    x\n from \n    n\n. The goal of the player\nis to minimize the value of \n    n\n in the end. Soon, Chouti found the game\ntrivial. Can you also beat the game? Input The input contains only one integer\nin the first line: \n    v\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 v \n    \u2264 10^9\n), the initial value of\n\n    n\n. Output Output a single integer, the minimum value of \n    n\n the\nplayer can get. Examples Input 8 Output 1 Input 1 Output 1 Note In the first\nexample, the player can choose \n    x=3\n in the first turn, then \n    n\n\nbecomes \n    5\n. He can then choose \n    x=4\n in the second turn to get\n\n    n=1\n as the result. There are other ways to get this minimum. However,\nfor example, he cannot choose \n    x=2\n in the first turn because \n    2\n is a\ndivisor of \n    8\n. In the second example, since \n    n=1\n initially, the\nplayer can do nothing.\n\n",
