        "description": "In a carnival game, there is a huge pyramid of cans with \n    2023\n rows,\nnumbered in a regular pattern as shown. If can \n    9^2\n is hit initially,\nthen all cans colored red in the picture above would fall. You throw a ball at\nthe pyramid, and it hits a single can with number \n    n^2\n. This causes all\ncans that are stacked on top of this can to fall (that is, can \n    n^2\n\nfalls, then the cans directly above \n    n^2\n fall, then the cans directly\nabove those cans, and so on). For example, the picture above shows the cans\nthat would fall if can \n    9^2\n is hit. What is the sum of the numbers on all\ncans that fall? Recall that \n    n^2 = n \n    \u00d7 n\n. Input The first line\ncontains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The only line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 it means that the can you hit has label\n\n    n^2\n. Output For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the sum of the\nnumbers on all cans that fall. Please note, that the answer for some test\ncases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit\ninteger type in your programming language (like long long for C++). For all\nvalid inputs, the answer will always fit into 64-bit integer type. Example\nInput 10 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 1434 1000000 Output 156 1 5 10 21 39 46 146 63145186\n58116199242129511 Note The first test case is pictured in the statement. The\nsum of the numbers that fall is \n    \n\n    1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 9^2 = 1 +\n    4 + 9 + 25 + 36 + 81 = 156.\n\n    \n In the second test case, only the can\nlabeled \n    1^2\n falls, so the answer is \n    1^2=1\n. In the third test case,\nthe cans labeled \n    1^2\n and \n    2^2\n fall, so the answer is\n\n    1^2+2^2=1+4=5\n. In the fourth test case, the cans labeled \n    1^2\n and\n\n    3^2\n fall, so the answer is \n    1^2+3^2=1+9=10\n. In the fifth test case,\nthe cans labeled \n    1^2\n, \n    2^2\n, and \n    4^2\n fall, so the answer is\n\n    1^2+2^2+4^2=1+4+16=21\n.\n\n",
