        "name": "The Best Vacation",
        "description": "You've been in love with Coronavirus-chan for a long time, but you didn't know\nwhere she lived until now. And just now you found out that she lives in a\nfaraway place called Naha. You immediately decided to take a vacation and\nvisit Coronavirus-chan. Your vacation lasts exactly \n    x\n days and that's\nthe exact number of days you will spend visiting your friend. You will spend\nexactly \n    x\n consecutive (successive) days visiting Coronavirus-chan. They\nuse a very unusual calendar in Naha: there are \n    n\n months in a year,\n\n    i\n-th month lasts exactly \n    d_i\n days. Days in the \n    i\n-th month\nare numbered from \n    1\n to \n    d_i\n. There are no leap years in Naha. The\nmood of Coronavirus-chan (and, accordingly, her desire to hug you) depends on\nthe number of the day in a month. In particular, you get \n    j\n hugs if you\nvisit Coronavirus-chan on the \n    j\n-th day of the month. You know about this\nfeature of your friend and want to plan your trip to get as many hugs as\npossible (and then maybe you can win the heart of Coronavirus-chan). Please\nnote that your trip should not necessarily begin and end in the same year.\nInput The first line of input contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    x\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of months in the year and the\nnumber of days you can spend with your friend. The second line contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    d_1, d_2, \n    \u2026, d_n\n, \n    d_i\n is the number of\ndays in the \n    i\n-th month (\n    1 \n    \u2264 d_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n). It is guaranteed\nthat \n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 d_1 + d_2 + \n    \u2026 + d_n\n. Output Print one\ninteger \u2014 the maximum number of hugs that you can get from Coronavirus-chan\nduring the best vacation in your life. Examples Input 3 2 1 3 1 Output 5 Input\n3 6 3 3 3 Output 12 Input 5 6 4 2 3 1 3 Output 15 Note In the first test case,\nthe numbers of the days in a year are (indices of days in a corresponding\nmonth) \n    1,1,2,3,1\n. Coronavirus-chan will hug you the most if\nyou come on the third day of the year: \n    2+3=5\n hugs. In the second test\ncase, the numbers of the days are \n    1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3\n. You will\nget the most hugs if you arrive on the third day of the year:\n\n    3+1+2+3+1+2=12\n hugs. In the third test case, the numbers of the days are\n\n    1,2,3,4,1,2, 1,2,3, 1, 1,2,3\n. You will get the most hugs if\nyou come on the twelfth day of the year: your friend will hug you\n\n    2+3+1+2+3+4=15\n times.\n\n",
