        "description": "You are given two strings \n    s\n and \n    t\n both of length \n    n\n and both\nconsisting of lowercase Latin letters. In one move, you can choose any length\n\n    len\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n and perform the following operation: Choose\nany contiguous substring of the string \n    s\n of length \n    len\n and reverse\nit; at the same time choose any contiguous substring of the string \n    t\n of\nlength \n    len\n and reverse it as well. Note that during one move you reverse\nexactly one substring of the string \n    s\n and exactly one substring of the\nstring \n    t\n. Also note that borders of substrings you reverse in \n    s\n\nand in \n    t\n can be different, the only restriction is that you reverse the\nsubstrings of equal length. For example, if \n    len=3\n and \n    n=5\n, you can\nreverse \n    s[1 \n    \u2026 3]\n and \n    t[3 \n    \u2026 5]\n, \n    s[2 \n    \u2026 4]\n\nand \n    t[2 \n    \u2026 4]\n, but not \n    s[1 \n    \u2026 3]\n and \n    t[1 \n    \u2026\n    2]\n. Your task is to say if it is possible to make strings \n    s\n and\n\n    t\n equal after some (possibly, empty) sequence of moves. You have to\nanswer \n    q\n independent test cases. Input The first line of the input\ncontains one integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Then \n    q\n test cases follow. The first line of the test case\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of \n    s\n and \n    t\n. The second line of the test case contains one\nstring \n    s\n consisting of \n    n\n lowercase Latin letters. The third line\nof the test case contains one string \n    t\n consisting of \n    n\n lowercase\nLatin letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n (\n    \u2211 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n).\nOutput For each test case, print the answer on it \u2014 \"YES\" (without quotes) if\nit is possible to make strings \n    s\n and \n    t\n equal after some (possibly,\nempty) sequence of moves and \"NO\" otherwise. Example Input 4 4 abcd abdc 5\nababa baaba 4 asdf asdg 4 abcd badc Output NO YES NO YES\n\n",
