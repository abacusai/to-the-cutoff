        "description": "New Year is coming in Tree Island! In this island, as the name implies, there\nare n cities connected by n - 1 roads, and for any two distinct cities there\nalways exists exactly one path between them. For every person in Tree Island,\nit takes exactly one minute to pass by exactly one road. There is a weird New\nYear tradition for runnners in Tree Island, which is called \"extreme run\".\nThis tradition can be done as follows. A runner chooses two distinct cities a\nand b. For simplicity, let's denote the shortest path from city a to city b as\np1, p2, ..., pl (here, p1 = a and pl = b holds). Then following happens: The\nrunner starts at city a. The runner runs from city a to b, following the\nshortest path from city a to city b. When the runner arrives at city b, he\nturns his direction immediately (it takes no time), and runs towards city a,\nfollowing the shortest path from city b to city a. When the runner arrives at\ncity a, he turns his direction immediately (it takes no time), and runs\ntowards city b, following the shortest path from city a to city b. Repeat step\n3 and step 4 forever. In short, the course of the runner can be denoted as:\nTwo runners JH and JY decided to run \"extremely\" in order to celebrate the New\nYear. JH has chosen two cities u and v, and JY has chosen two cities x and y.\nThey decided to start running at the same moment, and run until they meet at\nthe same city for the first time. Meeting on a road doesn't matter for them.\nBefore running, they want to know the amount of time they will run. It is too\nhard for JH and JY to calculate this, so they ask you for help. Input The\nfirst line contains a single positive integer n (5 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5) \u2014 the\nnumber of cities in Tree Island. Next n - 1 lines describe the roads of Tree\nIsland. The i-th line (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n - 1) of them contains two space-separated\nintegers ai and bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 n, ai \u2260 bi) \u2014 the vertices connected by a\nsingle road of the tree. The next line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2 \u00d7\n10^5) \u2014 the number of test cases. Next t lines describes the test cases. The\nj-th line (1 \u2264 j \u2264 t) of them contains four space-separated integers uj, vj,\nxj, yj (1 \u2264 uj, vj, xj, yj \u2264 n, uj \u2260 vj, xj \u2260 yj). It means that in this test\ncase, JH has chosen two cities uj and vj, JY has chosen two cities xj and yj.\nJH starts running at city uj, and JY starts running at city xj. Output For\neach test case, print an integer describing the amount of time they should run\nin minutes. If they have to run for an infinitely long time (in other words,\nif they never meet at the same city), print -1 instead. If they meet at the\nbeginning of their run, print 0.
