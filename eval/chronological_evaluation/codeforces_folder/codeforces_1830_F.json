        "description": "You are given \n    n\n intervals and \n    m\n points on the number line. The\n\n    i\n-th intervals covers coordinates \n    [l_i,r_i]\n and the \n    i\n-th\npoint is on coordinate \n    i\n and has coefficient \n    p_i\n. Initially, all\npoints are not activated. You should choose a subset of the \n    m\n points to\nactivate. For each of \n    n\n interval, we define its cost as: \n    0\n, if\nthere are no activated points in the interval; the coefficient of the\nactivated point with the largest coordinate within it, otherwise. Your task is\nto maximize the sum of the costs of all intervals by choosing which points to\nactivate. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of\ninput contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of\neach test case contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^6, 1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number of intervals and the number of\npoints. The following \n    n\n lines of each test case contains two integers\n\n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 m\n) \u2014 the endpoints\nof the \n    i\n-th interval. The following line of each test case contains\n\n    m\n integers \n    p_1,p_2,\n    \u2026,p_m\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014\nthe coefficients of the points. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n does\nnot exceed \n    10^6\n and the sum of \n    m\n does not exceed \n    10^6\n.\nOutput Output the maximum possible sum of costs of all intervals. Example\nInput 2 2 8 1 5 3 8 78 0 50 0 0 0 0 30 1 6 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 100 Output 108 0 Note\nIn the first sample, we can activate points \n    1\n and \n    8\n. The sum of\ncosts of all intervals will be \n    78+30=108\n. In the second sample, we will\nactivate no points. The sum of costs of all intervals will be \n    0\n.\n\n",
