        "description": "There is an array \n    a\n with \n    n-1\n integers. Let \n    x\n be the bitwise\nXOR of all elements of the array. The number \n    x\n is added to the end of\nthe array \n    a\n (now it has length \n    n\n), and then the elements are\nshuffled. You are given the newly formed array \n    a\n. What is \n    x\n? If\nthere are multiple possible values of \n    x\n, you can output any of them.\nInput The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains an integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of\nintegers in the resulting array \n    a\n. The second line of each test case\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    127\n) \u2014 the elements of the newly formed array \n    a\n. Additional\nconstraint on the input: the array \n    a\n is made by the process described in\nthe statement; that is, some value of \n    x\n exists. Output For each test\ncase, output a single integer \u2014 the value of \n    x\n, as described in the\nstatement. If there are multiple possible values of \n    x\n, output any of\nthem. Example Input 4 4 4 3 2 5 5 6 1 10 7 10 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 3 100 100 0 Output\n3 7 6 0 Note In the first test case, one possible array \n    a\n is \n    a=[2, 5,\n    4]\n. Then \n    x = 2 \n    \u2295 5 \n    \u2295 4 = 3\n (\n    \u2295\n denotes the\nbitwise XOR), so the new array is \n    [2, 5, 4, 3]\n. Afterwards, the array is\nshuffled to form \n    [4, 3, 2, 5]\n. In the second test case, one possible\narray \n    a\n is \n    a=[1, 10, 6, 10]\n. Then \n    x = 1 \n    \u2295 10 \n    \u2295 6\n    \n    \u2295 10 = 7\n, so the new array is \n    [1, 10, 6, 10, 7]\n. Afterwards,\nthe array is shuffled to form \n    [6, 1, 10, 7, 10]\n. In the third test case,\nall elements of the array are equal to \n    6\n, so \n    x=6\n. In the fourth\ntest case, one possible array \n    a\n is \n    a=[100, 100]\n. Then \n    x = 100\n    \n    \u2295 100 = 0\n, so the new array is \n    [100, 100, 0]\n. Afterwards, the\narray is shuffled to form \n    [100, 100, 0]\n. (Note that after the shuffle,\nthe array can remain the same.)\n\n",
