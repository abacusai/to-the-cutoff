        "name": "Polycarp and Div 3",
        "description": "Polycarp likes numbers that are divisible by 3. He has a huge number \n    s\n.\nPolycarp wants to cut from it the maximum number of numbers that are divisible\nby \n    3\n. To do this, he makes an arbitrary number of vertical cuts between\npairs of adjacent digits. As a result, after \n    m\n such cuts, there will be\n\n    m+1\n parts in total. Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and\nfinds the number of those that are divisible by \n    3\n. For example, if the\noriginal number is \n    s=3121\n, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts\nwith two cuts: \n    3|1|21\n. As a result, he will get two numbers that are\ndivisible by \n    3\n. Polycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts,\nwhere each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits. The resulting\nnumbers cannot contain extra leading zeroes (that is, the number can begin\nwith 0 if and only if this number is exactly one character '0'). For example,\n007, 01 and 00099 are not valid numbers, but 90, 0 and 10001 are valid. What\nis the maximum number of numbers divisible by \n    3\n that Polycarp can\nobtain? Input The first line of the input contains a positive integer \n    s\n.\nThe number of digits of the number \n    s\n is between \n    1\n and\n\n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n, inclusive. The first (leftmost) digit is not equal to 0.\nOutput Print the maximum number of numbers divisible by \n    3\n that Polycarp\ncan get by making vertical cuts in the given number \n    s\n. Examples Input\n3121 Output 2 Input 6 Output 1 Input 1000000000000000000000000000000000 Output\n33 Input 201920181 Output 4 Note In the first example, an example set of\noptimal cuts on the number is 3|1|21. In the second example, you do not need\nto make any cuts. The specified number 6 forms one number that is divisible by\n\n    3\n. In the third example, cuts must be made between each pair of digits.\nAs a result, Polycarp gets one digit 1 and \n    33\n digits 0. Each of the\n\n    33\n digits 0 forms a number that is divisible by \n    3\n. In the fourth\nexample, an example set of optimal cuts is 2|0|1|9|201|81. The numbers\n\n    0\n, \n    9\n, \n    201\n and \n    81\n are divisible by \n    3\n.\n\n",
