        "description": "Today Hayato came home from school with homework. In the assignment, Hayato\nwas given an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n. The task was to find \n    3\n\nnumbers in this array whose sum is odd. At school, he claimed that there are\nsuch \n    3\n numbers, but Hayato was not sure, so he asked you for help.\nAnswer if there are such three numbers, and if so, output indices \n    i\n,\n\n    j\n, and \n    k\n such that \n    a_i + a_j + a_k\n is odd. The odd numbers\nare integers that are not divisible by \n    2\n: \n    1\n, \n    3\n, \n    5\n, and\nso on. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 300\n) \u2014 the length of\n\n    a\n. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the array \n    a\n. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For each test case, in the first line print one\nword \"YES\" (without quotes) if there are \n    3\n numbers with an odd sum or\n\"NO\" (without quotes) if there are no such \n    3\n numbers. If the answer\nexists, then on the second line print \n    3\n distinct integers \n    i, j, k\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 i, j, k \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the indices of the numbers. If there are\nseveral answers, output any. Example Input 6 3 1 1 1 4 1 1 2 2 3 1 2 3 5 1 4 5\n1 2 4 2 6 2 4 5 5 6 3 2 1 Output YES 1 2 3 YES 3 4 1 NO YES 1 3 4 NO YES 1 3 5\nNote In the first test case, there is one way to choose \n    3\n numbers, and\nsince \n    1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n, this triple is fine for us. In the second test\ncase, you need to choose the numbers \n    1, 2, 2\n, since \n    1 + 2 + 2 = 5\n.\nIn the third test case, there is one way to choose three numbers, but \n    1 + 2\n    + 3 = 6\n is an even number, so the required triple does not exist. In the\nfifth test case, no matter what three numbers we choose, their sum is even.\n\n",
