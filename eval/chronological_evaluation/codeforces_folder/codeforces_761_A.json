        "description": "On her way to programming school tiger Dasha faced her first test \u2014 a huge\nstaircase! The steps were numbered from one to infinity. As we know, tigers\nare very fond of all striped things, it is possible that it has something to\ndo with their color. So on some interval of her way she calculated two values\n\u2014 the number of steps with even and odd numbers. You need to check whether\nthere is an interval of steps from the l-th to the r-th (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r), for which\nvalues that Dasha has found are correct. Input In the only line you are given\ntwo integers a, b (0 \u2264 a, b \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of even and odd steps,\naccordingly. Output In the only line print \"YES\", if the interval of steps\ndescribed above exists, and \"NO\" otherwise. Examples Input 2 3 Output YES\nInput 3 1 Output NO Note In the first example one of suitable intervals is\nfrom 1 to 5. The interval contains two even steps \u2014 2 and 4, and three odd: 1,\n3 and 5.\n\n",
