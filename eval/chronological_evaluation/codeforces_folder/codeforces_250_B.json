        "description": "An IPv6-address is a 128-bit number. For convenience, this number is recorded\nin blocks of 16 bits in hexadecimal record, the blocks are separated by colons\n\u2014 8 blocks in total, each block has four hexadecimal digits. Here is an\nexample of the correct record of a IPv6 address:\n\"0124:5678:90ab:cdef:0124:5678:90ab:cdef\". We'll call such format of recording\nan IPv6-address full. Besides the full record of an IPv6 address there is a\nshort record format. The record of an IPv6 address can be shortened by\nremoving one or more leading zeroes at the beginning of each block. However,\neach block should contain at least one digit in the short format. For example,\nthe leading zeroes can be removed like that:\n\"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:f19a:1000:0000\" \u2192 \"a56f:d3:0:0124:01:f19a:1000:00\".\nThere are more ways to shorten zeroes in this IPv6 address. Some IPv6\naddresses contain long sequences of zeroes. Continuous sequences of 16-bit\nzero blocks can be shortened to \"::\". A sequence can consist of one or several\nconsecutive blocks, with all 16 bits equal to 0. You can see examples of zero\nblock shortenings below: \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\" \u2192\n\"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::\"; \"a56f:0000:0000:0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\" \u2192\n\"a56f::0124:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\"; \"a56f:0000:0000:0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\" \u2192\n\"a56f:0000::0000:0001:0000:1234:0ff0\";\n\"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001:0000:0000:0000\" \u2192 \"a56f:00d3:0000:0124:0001::0000\";\n\"0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000\" \u2192 \"::\". It is not allowed to shorten\nzero blocks in the address more than once. This means that the short record\ncan't contain the sequence of characters \"::\" more than once. Otherwise, it\nwill sometimes be impossible to determine the number of zero blocks, each\nrepresented by a double colon. The format of the record of the IPv6 address\nafter removing the leading zeroes and shortening the zero blocks is called\nshort. You've got several short records of IPv6 addresses. Restore their full\nrecord. Input The first line contains a single integer n \u2014 the number of\nrecords to restore (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). Each of the following n lines contains a\nstring \u2014 the short IPv6 addresses. Each string only consists of string\ncharacters \"0123456789abcdef:\". It is guaranteed that each short address is\nobtained by the way that is described in the statement from some full IPv6\naddress. Output For each short IPv6 address from the input print its full\nrecord on a separate line. Print the full records for the short IPv6 addresses\nin the order, in which the short records follow in the input.
