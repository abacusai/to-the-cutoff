        "description": "In a far away galaxy there are n inhabited planets, numbered with numbers from\n1 to n. They are located at large distances from each other, that's why the\ncommunication between them was very difficult until on the planet number 1 a\nhyperdrive was invented. As soon as this significant event took place, n - 1\nspaceships were built on the planet number 1, and those ships were sent to\nother planets to inform about the revolutionary invention. Paradoxical thought\nit may be, but the hyperspace is represented as simple three-dimensional\nEuclidean space. The inhabited planets may be considered fixed points in it,\nand no two points coincide and no three points lie on the same straight line.\nThe movement of a ship with a hyperdrive between two planets is performed\nalong a straight line at the constant speed, the same for all the ships.\nThat's why the distance in the hyperspace are measured in hyperyears (a ship\nwith a hyperdrive covers a distance of s hyperyears in s years). When the ship\nreaches an inhabited planet, the inhabitants of the planet dissemble it, make\nn - 2 identical to it ships with a hyperdrive and send them to other n - 2\nplanets (except for the one from which the ship arrived). The time to make a\nnew ship compared to the time in which they move from one planet to another is\nso small that it can be disregarded. New ships are absolutely identical to the\nones sent initially: they move at the same constant speed along a straight\nline trajectory and, having reached a planet, perform the very same mission,\ni.e. are dissembled to build new n - 2 ships and send them to all the planets\nexcept for the one from which the ship arrived. Thus, the process of spreading\nthe important news around the galaxy continues. However the hyperdrive\ncreators hurried to spread the news about their invention so much that they\ndidn't study completely what goes on when two ships collide in the hyperspace.\nIf two moving ships find themselves at one point, they provoke an explosion of\ncolossal power, leading to the destruction of the galaxy! Your task is to find\nthe time the galaxy will continue to exist from the moment of the ships'\nlaunch from the first planet. Input The first line contains a number n (3 \u2264 n\n\u2264 5000) \u2014 the number of inhabited planets in the galaxy. The next n lines\ncontain integer coordinates of the planets in format \"xi yi zi\" ( - 10^4 \u2264 xi,\nyi, zi \u2264 10^4). Output Print the single number \u2014 the solution to the task with\nan absolute or relative error not exceeding 10^-6. Examples Input 4 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 0 1 0 0 Output 1.7071067812\n\n",
