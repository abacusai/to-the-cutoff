        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n. Let's define the eversion\noperation. Let \n    x = a_n\n. Then array \n    a\n is partitioned into two\nparts: left and right. The left part contains the elements of \n    a\n that are\nnot greater than \n    x\n (\n    \u2264 x\n). The right part contains the elements\nof \n    a\n that are strictly greater than \n    x\n (\n    > x\n). The order of\nelements in each part is kept the same as before the operation, i. e. the\npartition is stable. Then the array is replaced with the concatenation of the\nleft and the right parts. For example, if the array \n    a\n is \n    [2, 4, 1, 5,\n    3]\n, the eversion goes like this: \n    [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \n    \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5]\n    \n    \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]\n. We start with the array \n    a\n and perform\neversions on this array. We can prove that after several eversions the array\n\n    a\n stops changing. Output the minimum number \n    k\n such that the array\nstops changing after \n    k\n eversions. Input Each test contains multiple test\ncases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 100\n). Description of the test cases follows. The first line contains\na single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The second\nline contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case print a single\ninteger \n    k\n \u2014 the number of eversions after which the array stops\nchanging. Example Input 3 5 2 4 1 5 3 5 5 3 2 4 1 4 1 1 1 1 Output 1 2 0 Note\nConsider the fist example. The first eversion: \n    a = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3]\n, \n    x\n    = 3\n. \n    [2, 4, 1, 5, 3] \n    \u2192 [2, 1, 3], [4, 5] \n    \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]\n.\nThe second and following eversions: \n    a = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]\n, \n    x = 5\n.\n\n    [2, 1, 3, 4, 5] \n    \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5], [] \n    \u2192 [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]\n. This\neversion does not change the array, so the answer is \n    1\n. Consider the\nsecond example. The first eversion: \n    a = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1]\n, \n    x = 1\n.\n\n    [5, 3, 2, 4, 1] \n    \u2192 [1], [5, 3, 2, 4] \n    \u2192 [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]\n. The\nsecond eversion: \n    a = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]\n, \n    x = 4\n. \n    [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]\n    \n    \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4], [5] \n    \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]\n. The third and following\neversions: \n    a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]\n, \n    x = 5\n. \n    [1, 3, 2, 4, 5] \n    \u2192\n    [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], [] \n    \u2192 [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]\n. This eversion does not change\nthe array, so the answer is \n    2\n.\n\n",
