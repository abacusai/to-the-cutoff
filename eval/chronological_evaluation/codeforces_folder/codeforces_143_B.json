        "description": "For some time the program of rounding numbers that had been developed by the\nCodeforces participants during one of the previous rounds, helped the citizens\nof Far Far Away to convert numbers into a more easily readable format.\nHowever, as time went by, the economy of the Far Far Away developed and the\nscale of operations grew. So the King ordered to found the Bank of Far Far\nAway and very soon even the rounding didn't help to quickly determine even the\norder of the numbers involved in operations. Besides, rounding a number to an\ninteger wasn't very convenient as a bank needed to operate with all numbers\nwith accuracy of up to 0.01, and not up to an integer. The King issued yet\nanother order: to introduce financial format to represent numbers denoting\namounts of money. The formal rules of storing a number in the financial format\nare as follows: A number contains the integer part and the fractional part.\nThe two parts are separated with a character \".\" (decimal point). To make\ndigits in the integer part of a number easier to read, they are split into\ngroups of three digits, starting from the least significant ones. The groups\nare separated with the character \",\" (comma). For example, if the integer part\nof a number equals 12345678, then it will be stored in the financial format as\n12,345,678 In the financial format a number's fractional part should contain\nexactly two digits. So, if the initial number (the number that is converted\ninto the financial format) contains less than two digits in the fractional\npart (or contains no digits at all), it is complemented with zeros until its\nlength equals 2. If the fractional part contains more than two digits, the\nextra digits are simply discarded (they are not rounded: see sample tests).\nWhen a number is stored in the financial format, the minus sign is not\nwritten. Instead, if the initial number had the minus sign, the result is\nwritten in round brackets. Please keep in mind that the bank of Far Far Away\noperates using an exotic foreign currency \u2014 snakes (), that's why right\nbefore the number in the financial format we should put the sign \"\". If the\nnumber should be written in the brackets, then the snake sign should also be\ninside the brackets. For example, by the above given rules number 2012 will be\nstored in the financial format as \"2,012.00\" and number -12345678.9 will be\nstored as \"(12,345,678.90)\". The merchants of Far Far Away visited you again\nand expressed much hope that you supply them with the program that can convert\narbitrary numbers to the financial format. Can you help them? Input The input\ncontains a number that needs to be converted into financial format. The\nnumber's notation length does not exceed 100 characters, including (possible)\nsigns \"-\" (minus) and \".\" (decimal point). The number's notation is correct,\nthat is: The number's notation only contains characters from the set \"0\" \u2013\n\"9\", \"-\", \".\". The decimal point (if it is present) is unique and is preceded\nand followed by a non-zero quantity on decimal digits A number cannot start\nwith digit 0, except for a case when its whole integer part equals zero (in\nthis case the integer parts is guaranteed to be a single zero: \"0\"). The minus\nsign (if it is present) is unique and stands in the very beginning of the\nnumber's notation If a number is identically equal to 0 (that is, if it is\nwritten as, for example, \"0\" or \"0.000\"), than it is not preceded by the minus\nsign. The input data contains no spaces. The number's notation contains at\nleast one decimal digit. Output Print the number given in the input in the\nfinancial format by the rules described in the problem statement. Examples\nInput 2012 Output 2,012.00 Input 0.000 Output0.00 Input -0.00987654321\nOutput (0.00) Input -12345678.9 Output (12,345,678.90) Note Pay attention to\nthe second and third sample tests. They show that the sign of a number in the\nfinancial format (and consequently, the presence or absence of brackets) is\ndetermined solely by the sign of the initial number. It does not depend on the\nsign of the number you got after translating the number to the financial\nformat.\n\n",
