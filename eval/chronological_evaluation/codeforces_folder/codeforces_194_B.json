        "description": "There is a square painted on a piece of paper, the square's side equals n\nmeters. John Doe draws crosses on the square's perimeter. John paints the\nfirst cross in the lower left corner of the square. Then John moves along the\nsquare's perimeter in the clockwise direction (first upwards, then to the\nright, then downwards, then to the left and so on). Every time he walks (n +\n1) meters, he draws a cross (see picture for clarifications). John Doe stops\nonly when the lower left corner of the square has two crosses. How many\ncrosses will John draw? The figure shows the order in which John draws crosses\nfor a square with side 4. The lower left square has two crosses. Overall John\npaints 17 crosses. Input The first line contains integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. The second line contains t space-separated integers\nni (1 \u2264 ni \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the sides of the square for each test sample. Output For\neach test sample print on a single line the answer to it, that is, the number\nof crosses John will draw as he will move along the square of the\ncorresponding size. Print the answers to the samples in the order in which the\nsamples are given in the input. Please do not use the \nor write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams\nor the \n\n",
