        "description": "Levko loves tables that consist of n rows and n columns very much. He\nespecially loves beautiful tables. A table is beautiful to Levko if the sum of\nelements in each row and column of the table equals k. Unfortunately, he\ndoesn't know any such table. Your task is to help him to find at least one of\nthem. Input The single line contains two integers, n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k\n\u2264 1000). Output Print any beautiful table. Levko doesn't like too big numbers,\nso all elements of the table mustn't exceed 1000 in their absolute value. If\nthere are multiple suitable tables, you are allowed to print any of them.\nExamples Input 2 4 Output 1 3 3 1 Input 4 7 Output 2 1 0 4 4 0 2 1 1 3 3 0 0 3\n2 2 Note In the first sample the sum in the first row is 1 + 3 = 4, in the\nsecond row \u2014 3 + 1 = 4, in the first column \u2014 1 + 3 = 4 and in the second\ncolumn \u2014 3 + 1 = 4. There are other beautiful tables for this sample. In the\nsecond sample the sum of elements in each row and each column equals 7.\nBesides, there are other tables that meet the statement requirements.\n\n",
