        "description": "Polycarp is playing a game called \"Running Over The Bridges\". In this game he\nhas to run over n bridges from the left to the right. Bridges are arranged one\nafter the other, so the i-th bridge begins where the (i - 1)-th bridge ends.\nYou have the following data about bridges: li and ti \u2014 the length of the i-th\nbridge and the maximum allowed time which Polycarp can spend running over the\ni-th bridge. Thus, if Polycarp is in the beginning of the bridge i at the time\nT then he has to leave it at the time T + ti or earlier. It is allowed to\nreach the right end of a bridge exactly at the time T + ti. Polycarp can run\nfrom the left side to the right one with speed 0.5, so he will run over a\nbridge with length s in time 2\u00b7s. Besides, he has several magical drinks. If\nhe uses one drink, his speed increases twice (i.e. to value 1) for r seconds.\nAll magical drinks are identical. Please note that Polycarp can use a drink\nonly at integer moments of time, and he drinks it instantly and completely.\nAdditionally, if Polycarp uses a drink at the moment T he can use the next\ndrink not earlier than at the moment T + r. What is the minimal number of\ndrinks Polycarp has to use to run over all n bridges? If this number is not\ngreater than 10^5, then you have to find out the moments of time when Polycarp\nhas to use each magical drink. Input The first line contains two integers n\nand r (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5, 1 \u2264 r \u2264 10^12) \u2014 the number of bridges and the duration\nof the effect of a magical drink. The second line contains a sequence of\nintegers l1, l2, ..., ln (1 \u2264 li \u2264 5\u00b710^6), where li is equal to the length of\nthe i-th bridge. The third line contains a sequence of integers t1, t2, ...,\ntn (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 10^7), where ti is equal to the maximum allowed time which\nPolycarp can spend running over the i-th bridge. Output The first line of the\noutput should contain k \u2014 the minimal number of drinks which Polycarp has to\nuse, or -1 if there is no solution. If the solution exists and the value of k\nis not greater than 10^5 then output k integers on the next line \u2014 moments of\ntime from beginning of the game when Polycarp has to use drinks. Print the\nmoments of time in chronological order. If there are several solutions, you\ncan output any of them. Examples Input 1 3 7 10 Output 2 0 3 Input 3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 2 Output -1 Input 3 100000 5 5 5 5 7 8 Output 1 0 Input 4 1000 1 2 3 4 10 9\n10 9 Output 0 Note In the first case, there is only one bridge and it is clear\nthat Polycarp cannot run over it without magical drinks. So, if he will use\none magical drink on start (moment of time 0), and the second one \u2014 three\nseconds later (moment of time 3), he will be able to reach the end of the\nbridge in time. Please note, in this case there are several possible answers\nto the problem. For example, Polycarp can use the first drink at the moment of\ntime 4 and the second one \u2014 at the moment of time 7. In the second case,\nPolycarp cannot run over all bridges even if he will use magical drinks. So,\nanswer in this case is -1. In the fourth case, Polycarp can run over all\nbridges without magical drinks.\n\n",
