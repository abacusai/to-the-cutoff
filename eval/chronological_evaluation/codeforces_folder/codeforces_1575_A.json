        "description": "Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of \n    n\n\nbooks. Each book is represented by the book title \u2014 a string \n    s_i\n\nnumbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, each with length \n    m\n. Andi really wants\nto sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it\nlexicographically descending. Settling their fight, they decided to combine\ntheir idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters\nwill be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared\ndescendingly. A string \n    a\n occurs before a string \n    b\n in asc-desc-\nending order if and only if in the first position where \n    a\n and \n    b\n\ndiffer, the following holds: if it is an odd position, the string \n    a\n has\na letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in\n\n    b\n; if it is an even position, the string \n    a\n has a letter that\nappears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in \n    b\n. Input\nThe first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u00b7 m \n    \u2264 10^6\n). The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    n\n lines contains a\nstring \n    s_i\n consisting of \n    m\n uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the book\ntitle. The strings are pairwise distinct. Output Output \n    n\n integers \u2014 the\nindices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly. Example Input\n5 2 AA AB BB BA AZ Output 5 2 1 3 4 Note The following illustrates the first\nexample.\n\n",
