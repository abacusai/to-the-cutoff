The Corporation has decided to try rebranding \u2014 an active marketing\nstrategy, that includes a set of measures to change either the brand (both for\nthe company and the goods it produces) or its components: the name, the logo,\nthe slogan.

Once a company hires the i-th\ndesigner, he immediately contributes to the creation of a new corporation name\nas follows: he takes the newest version of the name and replaces all the\nletters xi by yi, and all the letters yi by xi. This results in the new\nversion. It is possible that some of these letters do no occur in the string.\nIt may also happen that xi coincides with yi. The version of the name received\nafter the work of the last designer becomes the new name of the corporation.\nManager Arkady has recently got a job in this company, but is already soaked\nin the spirit of teamwork and is very worried about the success of the\nrebranding. Naturally, he can't wait to find out what is the new name the\nCorporation will receive. Satisfy Arkady's curiosity and tell him the final\nversion of the name.
