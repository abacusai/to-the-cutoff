        "description": "Vasya has a grid with \n    2\n rows and \n    n\n columns. He colours each cell\nred, green, or blue. Vasya is colourblind and can't distinguish green from\nblue. Determine if Vasya will consider the two rows of the grid to be coloured\nthe same. Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test\ncase contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of\ncolumns of the grid. The following two lines each contain a string consisting\nof \n    n\n characters, each of which is either R, G, or B, representing a red,\ngreen, or blue cell, respectively \u2014 the description of the grid. Output For\neach test case, output \"YES\" if Vasya considers the grid's two rows to be\nidentical, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for\nexample, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a\npositive answer). Example Input 6 2 RG RB 4 GRBG GBGB 5 GGGGG BBBBB 7 BBBBBBB\nRRRRRRR 8 RGBRRGBR RGGRRBGR 1 G G Output YES NO YES NO YES YES Note In the\nfirst test case, Vasya sees the second cell of each row as the same because\nthe second cell of the first row is green and the second cell of the second\nrow is blue, so he can't distinguish these two cells. The rest of the rows are\nequal in colour. Therefore, Vasya will say that the two rows are coloured the\nsame, even though they aren't. In the second test case, Vasya can see that the\ntwo rows are different. In the third test case, every cell is green or blue,\nso Vasya will think they are the same.\n\n",
