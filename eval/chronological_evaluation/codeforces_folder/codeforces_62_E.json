        "name": "World Evil",
        "description": "As a result of Pinky and Brain's mysterious experiments in the Large Hadron\nCollider some portals or black holes opened to the parallel dimension. And the\nWorld Evil has crept to the veil between their world and ours. Brain quickly\nevaluated the situation and he understood that the more evil tentacles creep\nout and become free, the higher is the possibility that Brain will rule the\nworld. The collider's constriction is a rectangular grid rolled into a\ncylinder and consisting of n rows and m columns such as is shown in the\npicture below: In this example n = 4, m = 5. Dotted lines are corridores that\nclose each column to a ring, i. e. connect the n-th and the 1-th rows of the\ngrid. In the leftmost column of the grid the portals are situated and the\ntentacles of the World Evil are ready to creep out from there. In the\nrightmost column the exit doors are located. The tentacles can only get out\nthrough those doors. The segments joining the nodes of the grid are corridors.\nBrain would be glad to let all the tentacles out but he faces a problem: the\ninfinite number of tentacles can creep out of the portals, every tentacle\npossesses infinite length and some width and the volume of the corridors are,\nunfortunately, quite limited. Brain could approximately evaluate the maximal\nnumber of tentacles that will be able to crawl through every corridor. Now\nhelp the mice to determine the maximal number of tentacles of the World Evil\nthat will crawl out of the Large Hadron Collider. Input The first line of the\ninput file contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 5, 2 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5). They are\nthe sizes of the Large Hadron Collider grid. The next m - 1 lines contain n\nnumbers each. They are the horizontal corridors' capacities. The next m lines\ncontain n numbers each. They are the vertical corridors' capacities. Corridors\nare described from left to right and from top to bottom. Every n-th vertical\ncorridor connects nodes of the n-th and 1-th rows. A corridor's capacity is a\nnon-negative integer that does not exceed 10^9. Output Print a single number,\nthe number of the World Evil tentacles Pinky and Brain will command. Please,\ndo not use \npreffered to use cout (also you may use \n5 5 3 4 1 2 1 3 1 3 5 4 1 4 3 Output 7 Input 2 2 9 2 2 3 6 1 Output 11\n\n",
