        "description": "We call a function good if its domain of definition is some set of integers\nand if in case it's defined in \n    x\n and \n    x-1\n, \n    f(x) = f(x-1) + 1\n\nor \n    f(x) = f(x-1)\n. Tanya has found \n    n\n good functions \n    f_1,\n    \n    \u2026, f_n\n, which are defined on all integers from \n    0\n to\n\n    10^18\n and \n    f_i(0) = 0\n and \n    f_i(10^18) = L\n for all \n    i\n\nfrom \n    1\n to \n    n\n. It's an notorious coincidence that \n    n\n is a\ndivisor of \n    L\n. She suggests Alesya a game. Using one question Alesya can\nask Tanya a value of any single function in any single point. To win Alesya\nmust choose integers \n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 l_i\n    \u2264\n    r_i\n    \u2264 10^18\n), such that \n    f_i(r_i) - f_i(l_i) \n    \u2265\n    L/n\n (here \n    f_i(x)\n means the value of \n    i\n-th function at\npoint \n    x\n) for all \n    i\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n so that for\nany pair of two functions their segments \n    [l_i, r_i]\n don't intersect (but\nmay have one common point). Unfortunately, Tanya doesn't allow to make more\nthan \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n questions. Help Alesya to win! It can be proved\nthat it's always possible to choose \n    [l_i, r_i]\n which satisfy the\nconditions described above. It's guaranteed, that Tanya doesn't change\nfunctions during the game, i.e. interactor is not adaptive Input The first\nline contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    L\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n,\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 L \n    \u2264 10^18\n, \n    n\n is a divisor of \n    L\n) \u2014 number of\nfunctions and their value in \n    10^18\n. Output When you've found needed\n\n    l_i, r_i\n, print \n    \"!\"\n without quotes on a separate line and then\n\n    n\n lines, \n    i\n-th from them should contain two integers \n    l_i\n,\n\n    r_i\n divided by space. Interaction To ask \n    f_i(x)\n, print symbol \"?\"\nwithout quotes and then two integers \n    i\n and \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    n\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^18\n). Note, you must flush your output to\nget a response. After that, you should read an integer which is a value of\n\n    i\n-th function in point \n    x\n. You're allowed not more than \n    2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n questions. To flush you can use (just after printing an\ninteger and end-of-line): fflush(stdout) in C++; System.out.flush() in Java;\nstdout.flush() in Python; flush(output) in Pascal; See the documentation for\nother languages. Hacks: Only tests where \n    1 \n    \u2264 L \n    \u2264 2000\n are\nallowed for hacks, for a hack set a test using following format: The first\nline should contain two integers \n    n\n and \n    L\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    1000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 L \n    \u2264 2000\n, \n    n\n is a divisor of \n    L\n) \u2014\nnumber of functions and their value in \n    10^18\n. Each of \n    n\n\nfollowing lines should contain \n    L\n numbers \n    l_1\n, \n    l_2\n, ... ,\n\n    l_L\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 l_j < 10^18\n for all \n    1 \n    \u2264 j \n    \u2264 L\n and\n\n    l_j < l_j+1\n for all \n    1 < j \n    \u2264 L\n), in \n    i\n-th of them\n\n    l_j\n means that \n    f_i(l_j) < f_i(l_j + 1)\n. Example Input 5 5 ? 1 0 ?\n1 1 ? 2 1 ? 2 2 ? 3 2 ? 3 3 ? 4 3 ? 4 4 ? 5 4 ? 5 5 ! 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5\nOutput 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 5 Note In the example Tanya has \n    5\n same\nfunctions where \n    f(0) = 0\n, \n    f(1) = 1\n, \n    f(2) = 2\n, \n    f(3) =\n    3\n, \n    f(4) = 4\n and all remaining points have value \n    5\n. Alesya must\nchoose two integers for all functions so that difference of values of a\nfunction in its points is not less than \n    L/n\n (what is \n    1\n\nhere) and length of intersection of segments is zero. One possible way is to\nchoose pairs \n    [0\n, \n    1]\n, \n    [1\n, \n    2]\n, \n    [2\n, \n    3]\n,\n\n    [3\n, \n    4]\n and \n    [4\n, \n    5]\n for functions \n    1\n, \n    2\n,\n\n    3\n, \n    4\n and \n    5\n respectively.\n\n",
