        "description": "You are given a string \n    s\n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. In one\noperation, you can select several (one or more) positions in it such that no\ntwo selected positions are adjacent to each other. Then you remove the letters\non the selected positions from the string. The resulting parts are\nconcatenated without changing their order. What is the smallest number of\noperations required to make all the letters in \n    s\n the same? Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014\nthe number of testcases. The only line of each testcase contains a string\n\n    s\n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Its length is from \n    1\n to\n\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. The total length of the strings over all testcases\ndoesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each testcase, print a single\ninteger \u2014 the smallest number of operations required to make all the letters\nin the given string \n    s\n the same. Example Input 5 abacaba codeforces\noooooooo abcdef mewheniseearulhiiarul Output 1 3 0 2 4 Note In the first\ntestcase, you can select positions \n    2, 4\n and \n    6\n and remove the\ncorresponding letters 'b', 'c' and 'b'. In the third testcase, the letters in\nthe string are already the same, so you don't have to make any operations. In\nthe fourth testcase, one of the possible solutions in \n    2\n operations is\nthe following. You can select positions \n    1, 4, 6\n first. The string\nbecomes \"bce\". Then select positions \n    1\n and \n    3\n. The string becomes\n\"c\". All letters in it are the same, since it's just one letter.\n\n",
