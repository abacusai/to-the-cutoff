        "description": "Once Petya read a problem about a bracket sequence. He gave it much thought\nbut didn't find a solution. Today you will face it. You are given string s. It\nrepresents a correct bracket sequence. A correct bracket sequence is the\nsequence of opening (\"(\") and closing (\")\") brackets, such that it is possible\nto obtain a correct mathematical expression from it, inserting numbers and\noperators between the brackets. For example, such sequences as \"(())()\" and\n\"()\" are correct bracket sequences and such sequences as \")()\" and \"(()\" are\nnot. In a correct bracket sequence each bracket corresponds to the matching\nbracket (an opening bracket corresponds to the matching closing bracket and\nvice versa). For example, in a bracket sequence shown of the figure below, the\nthird bracket corresponds to the matching sixth one and the fifth bracket\ncorresponds to the fourth one. You are allowed to color some brackets in the\nbracket sequence so as all three conditions are fulfilled: Each bracket is\neither not colored any color, or is colored red, or is colored blue. For any\npair of matching brackets exactly one of them is colored. In other words, for\nany bracket the following is true: either it or the matching bracket that\ncorresponds to it is colored. No two neighboring colored brackets have the\nsame color. Find the number of different ways to color the bracket sequence.\nThe ways should meet the above-given conditions. Two ways of coloring are\nconsidered different if they differ in the color of at least one bracket. As\nthe result can be quite large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Input\nThe first line contains the single string s (2 \u2264 |s| \u2264 700) which represents a\ncorrect bracket sequence. Output Print the only number \u2014 the number of ways to\ncolor the bracket sequence that meet the above given conditions modulo\n1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Examples Input (()) Output 12 Input (()()) Output 40\nInput () Output 4 Note Let's consider the first sample test. The bracket\nsequence from the sample can be colored, for example, as is shown on two\nfigures below. The two ways of coloring shown below are incorrect.\n\n",
