        "description": "Polycarp plays a well-known computer game (we won't mention its name). In this\ngame, he can craft tools of two types \u2014 shovels and swords. To craft a shovel,\nPolycarp spends two sticks and one diamond; to craft a sword, Polycarp spends\ntwo diamonds and one stick. Each tool can be sold for exactly one emerald. How\nmany emeralds can Polycarp earn, if he has \n    a\n sticks and \n    b\n\ndiamonds? Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The only line of each test case\ncontains two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014\nthe number of sticks and the number of diamonds, respectively. Output For each\ntest case print one integer \u2014 the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can\nearn. Example Input 4 4 4 1000000000 0 7 15 8 7 Output 2 0 7 5 Note In the\nfirst test case Polycarp can earn two emeralds as follows: craft one sword and\none shovel. In the second test case Polycarp does not have any diamonds, so he\ncannot craft anything.\n\n",
