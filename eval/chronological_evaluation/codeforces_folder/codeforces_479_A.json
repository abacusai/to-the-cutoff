On the last class the teacher wrote three positive\nintegers a, b, c on the blackboard. The task was to insert signs of operations\n'+' and '*', and probably brackets between the numbers so that the value of\nthe resulting expression is as large as possible. Let's consider an example:\nassume that the teacher wrote numbers 1, 2 and 3 on the blackboard. Here are\nsome ways of placing signs and brackets: 1+2*3=7 1*(2+3)=5 1*2*3=6 (1+2)*3=9\nNote that you can insert operation signs only between a and b, and between b\nand c, that is, you cannot swap integers. For instance, in the given sample\nyou cannot get expression (1+3)*2. It's easy to see that the maximum value\nthat you can obtain is 9. Your task is: given a, b and c print the maximum\nvalue that you can get. Input The input contains three integers a, b and c,\neach on a single line (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10). Output Print the maximum value of\nthe expression that you can obtain. Examples Input 1 2 3 Output 9 Input 2 10 3\nOutput 60\n\n",
