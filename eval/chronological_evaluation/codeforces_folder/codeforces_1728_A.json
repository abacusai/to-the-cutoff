        "name": "Colored Balls: Revisited",
        "description": "The title is a reference to the very first Educational Round from our writers\nteam, Educational Round 18. There is a bag, containing colored balls. There\nare \n    n\n different colors of balls, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. There\nare \n    \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61_i\n balls of color \n    i\n in the bag. The total amount\nof balls in the bag is odd (e. g. \n    \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61_1 + \n    \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61_2 +\n    \n    \u2026 + \n    \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61_n\n is odd). In one move, you can choose two balls\nwith different colors and take them out of the bag. At some point, all the\nremaining balls in the bag will have the same color. That's when you can't\nmake moves anymore. Find any possible color of the remaining balls. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014\nthe number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 20\n) \u2014 the number of colors. The second\nline contains \n    n\n integers \n    \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61_1, \n    \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61_2, \n    \u2026,\n    \n    \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61_i \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the amount of\nballs of each color in the bag. The total amount of balls in the bag is odd\n(e. g. \n    \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61_1 + \n    \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61_2 + \n    \u2026 + \n    \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61_n\n\nis odd). Output For each testcase, print a single integer \u2014 any possible color\nof the remaining balls, after you made some moves and can't make moves\nanymore. Example Input 3 3 1 1 1 1 9 2 4 7 Output 3 1 2 Note In the first\ntestcase, your first and only move can be one of the following: take balls\nwith colors \n    1\n and \n    2\n; take balls with colors \n    1\n and \n    3\n;\ntake balls with colors \n    2\n and \n    3\n. After the move, exactly one ball\nwill remain. Its color can be \n    3, 2\n or \n    1\n depending on the move. In\nthe second testcase, you can't make moves at all \u2014 there is only color of\nballs already. This color is \n    1\n. In the third testcase, you can keep\nremoving one ball of color \n    1\n and one ball of color \n    2\n until there\nare no more balls of color \n    1\n. At the end, three balls of color \n    2\n\nremain.\n\n",
