        "description": "Recently, Masha was presented with a chessboard with a height of \n    n\n and a\nwidth of \n    m\n. The rows on the chessboard are numbered from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n from bottom to top. The columns are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    m\n\nfrom left to right. Therefore, each cell can be specified with the coordinates\n\n    (x,y)\n, where \n    x\n is the column number, and \n    y\n is the row number\n(do not mix up). Let us call a rectangle with coordinates \n    (a,b,c,d)\n a\nrectangle lower left point of which has coordinates \n    (a,b)\n, and the upper\nright one \u2014 \n    (c,d)\n. The chessboard is painted black and white as follows:\nAn example of a chessboard. Masha was very happy with the gift and, therefore,\ninvited her friends Maxim and Denis to show off. The guys decided to make her\na treat \u2014 they bought her a can of white and a can of black paint, so that if\nthe old board deteriorates, it can be repainted. When they came to Masha,\nsomething unpleasant happened: first, Maxim went over the threshold and\nspilled white paint on the rectangle \n    (x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2)\n. Then after him\nDenis spilled black paint on the rectangle \n    (x_3,y_3,x_4,y_4)\n. To spill\npaint of color \n    color\n onto a certain rectangle means that all the cells\nthat belong to the given rectangle become \n    color\n. The cell dyeing is\nsuperimposed on each other (if at first some cell is spilled with white paint\nand then with black one, then its color will be black). Masha was shocked! She\ndrove away from the guests and decided to find out how spoiled the gift was.\nFor this, she needs to know the number of cells of white and black color. Help\nher find these numbers! Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each of them is\ndescribed in the following format: The first line contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n,m \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the size of the board.\nThe second line contains four integers \n    x_1\n, \n    y_1\n, \n    x_2\n,\n\n    y_2\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_1 \n    \u2264 x_2 \n    \u2264 m, 1 \n    \u2264 y_1 \n    \u2264 y_2 \n    \u2264 n\n)\n\u2014 the coordinates of the rectangle, the white paint was spilled on. The third\nline contains four integers \n    x_3\n, \n    y_3\n, \n    x_4\n, \n    y_4\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 x_3 \n    \u2264 x_4 \n    \u2264 m, 1 \n    \u2264 y_3 \n    \u2264 y_4 \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the\ncoordinates of the rectangle, the black paint was spilled on. Output Output\n\n    t\n lines, each of which contains two numbers \u2014 the number of white and\nblack cells after spilling paint, respectively.

The second picture of each illustration shows how the field looked\nafter Maxim spoiled white dye (the rectangle on which the dye was spilled is\nhighlighted with red). The third picture in each illustration shows how the\nfield looked after Denis spoiled black dye (the rectangle on which the dye was\nspilled is highlighted with red). In the first test, the paint on the field\nchanged as follows: In the second test, the paint on the field changed as\nfollows: In the third test, the paint on the field changed as follows: In the\nfourth test, the paint on the field changed as follows: In the fifth test, the\npaint on the field changed as follows:\n\n",
