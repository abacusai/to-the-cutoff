        "description": "Iahub got bored, so he invented a game to be played on paper. He writes n\nintegers a1, a2, ..., an. Each of those integers can be either 0 or 1. He's\nallowed to do exactly one move: he chooses two indices i and j (1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n)\nand flips all values ak for which their positions are in range [i, j] (that is\ni \u2264 k \u2264 j). Flip the value of x means to apply operation x = 1 - x. The goal\nof the game is that after exactly one move to obtain the maximum number of\nones. Write a program to solve the little game of Iahub. Input The first line\nof the input contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). In the second line of the\ninput there are n integers: a1, a2, ..., an. It is guaranteed that each of\nthose n values is either 0 or 1. Output Print an integer \u2014 the maximal number\nof 1s that can be obtained after exactly one move. Examples Input 5 1 0 0 1 0\nOutput 4 Input 4 1 0 0 1 Output 4 Note In the first case, flip the segment\nfrom 2 to 5 (i = 2, j = 5). That flip changes the sequence, it becomes: [1 1 1\n0 1]. So, it contains four ones. There is no way to make the whole sequence\nequal to [1 1 1 1 1]. In the second case, flipping only the second and the\nthird element (i = 2, j = 3) will turn all numbers into 1.\n\n",
