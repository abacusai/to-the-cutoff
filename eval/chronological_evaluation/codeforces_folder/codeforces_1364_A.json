        "description": "Ehab loves number theory, but for some reason he hates the number \n    x\n.\nGiven an array \n    a\n, find the length of its longest subarray such that the\nsum of its elements isn't divisible by \n    x\n, or determine that such\nsubarray doesn't exist. An array \n    a\n is a subarray of an array \n    b\n if\n\n    a\n can be obtained from \n    b\n by deletion of several (possibly, zero or\nall) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements\nfrom the end. Input The first line contains an integer \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 5)\n \u2014 the number of test cases you need to solve. The description of\nthe test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains 2 integers\n\n    n\n and \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014\nthe number of elements in the array \n    a\n and the number that Ehab hates.\nThe second line contains \n    n\n space-separated integers \n    a_1\n,\n\n    a_2\n, \n    \u2026\n, \n    a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the\nelements of the array \n    a\n. Output For each testcase, print the length of\nthe longest subarray whose sum isn't divisible by \n    x\n. If there's no such\nsubarray, print \n    -1\n. Example Input 3 3 3 1 2 3 3 4 1 2 3 2 2 0 6 Output 2\n3 -1 Note In the first test case, the subarray \n    [2,3]\n has sum of elements\n\n    5\n, which isn't divisible by \n    3\n. In the second test case, the sum of\nelements of the whole array is \n    6\n, which isn't divisible by \n    4\n. In\nthe third test case, all subarrays have an even sum, so the answer is\n\n    -1\n.\n\n",
