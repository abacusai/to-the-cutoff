        "description": "Jenya has recently acquired quite a useful tool \u2014 k-scissors for cutting\nstrings. They are generally used for cutting out two non-intersecting\nsubstrings of length k from an arbitrary string s (its length should be at\nleast 2\u00b7k in order to perform this operation) and concatenating them\nafterwards (preserving the initial order). For example, with the help of\n2-scissors you can cut ab and de out of abcde and concatenate them into abde,\nbut not ab and bc since they're intersecting. It's a nice idea to test this\ntool before using it in practice. After looking through the papers, Jenya came\nup with two strings s and t. His question is whether it is possible to apply\nhis scissors to string s such that the resulting concatenation contains t as a\nsubstring? Input The first line contains three integers n, m, k (2 \u2264 m \u2264 2\u00b7k \u2264\nn \u2264 5\u00b710^5) \u2014 length of s, length of t and the aforementioned scissors'\nparameter correspondingly. The next two lines feature s and t consisting of\nlowercase latin letters. Output If there is no answer, print \u00abNo\u00bb. Otherwise\nprint \u00abYes\u00bb and two integers L and R denoting the indexes where cutted\nsubstrings start (1-indexed). If there are several possible answers, output\nany. Examples Input 7 4 3 baabaab aaaa Output Yes 1 5 Input 6 3 2 cbcbcb bcc\nOutput Yes 2 5 Input 7 5 3 aabbaaa aaaaa Output No Note In the first sample\ncase you can cut out two substrings starting at 1 and 5. The resulting string\nbaaaab contains aaaa as a substring. In the second sample case the resulting\nstring is bccb.\n\n",
