        "description": "Madoka is a very strange girl, and therefore she suddenly wondered how many\npairs of integers \n    (a, b)\n exist, where \n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 n\n, for\nwhich \n    lcm(a, b)/\n    gcd(a, b)\n    \u2264 3\n. In this problem, \n    gcd(a, b)\n denotes the\ngreatest common divisor of the numbers \n    a\n and \n    b\n, and\n\n    lcm(a, b)\n denotes the smallest common multiple of the\nnumbers \n    a\n and \n    b\n. Input The input consists of multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first\nand the only line of each test case contains the integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^8\n). Output For each test case output a single integer \u2014 the number\nof pairs of integers satisfying the condition. Example Input 6 1 2 3 4 5\n100000000 Output 1 4 7 10 11 266666666 Note For \n    n = 1\n there is exactly\none pair of numbers \u2014 \n    (1, 1)\n and it fits. For \n    n = 2\n, there are\nonly \n    4\n pairs \u2014 \n    (1, 1)\n, \n    (1, 2)\n, \n    (2, 1)\n, \n    (2, 2)\n\nand they all fit. For \n    n = 3\n, all \n    9\n pair are suitable, except\n\n    (2, 3)\n and \n    (3, 2)\n, since their \n    lcm\n is\n\n    6\n, and \n    gcd\n is \n    1\n, which doesn't fit the\ncondition.\n\n",
