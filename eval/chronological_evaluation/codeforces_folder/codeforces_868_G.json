        "description": "The prehistoric caves of El Toll are located in Moi\u00e0 (Barcelona). You have\nheard that there is a treasure hidden in one of n possible spots in the caves.\nYou assume that each of the spots has probability 1 / n to contain a treasure.\nYou cannot get into the caves yourself, so you have constructed a robot that\ncan search the caves for treasure. Each day you can instruct the robot to\nvisit exactly k distinct spots in the caves. If none of these spots contain\ntreasure, then the robot will obviously return with empty hands. However, the\ncaves are dark, and the robot may miss the treasure even when visiting the\nright spot. Formally, if one of the visited spots does contain a treasure, the\nrobot will obtain it with probability 1 / 2, otherwise it will return empty.\nEach time the robot searches the spot with the treasure, his success\nprobability is independent of all previous tries (that is, the probability to\nmiss the treasure after searching the right spot x times is 1 / 2^x). What is\nthe expected number of days it will take to obtain the treasure if you choose\noptimal scheduling for the robot? Output the answer as a rational number\nmodulo 10^9 + 7. Formally, let the answer be an irreducible fraction P / Q,\nthen you have to output . It is guaranteed that Q is not divisible by 10^9 +\n7. Input The first line contains the number of test cases T (1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000).\nEach of the next T lines contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 5\u00b710^8).\nOutput For each test case output the answer in a separate line. Example Input\n3 1 1 2 1 3 2 Output 2 500000007 777777786 Note In the first case the robot\nwill repeatedly search in the only spot. The expected number of days in this\ncase is 2. Note that in spite of the fact that we know the treasure spot from\nthe start, the robot still has to search there until he succesfully recovers\nthe treasure. In the second case the answer can be shown to be equal to 7 / 2\nif we search the two spots alternatively. In the third case the answer is 25 /\n9.\n\n",
