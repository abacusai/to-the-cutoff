        "description": "You are given an array \n    a[0 \n    \u2026 n - 1] = [a_0, a_1, \n    \u2026, a_n -\n    1]\n of zeroes and ones only. Note that in this problem, unlike the others,\nthe array indexes are numbered from zero, not from one. In one step, the array\n\n    a\n is replaced by another array of length \n    n\n according to the\nfollowing rules: First, a new array \n    a^\n    \u2192 d\n is defined as a\ncyclic shift of the array \n    a\n to the right by \n    d\n cells. The elements\nof this array can be defined as \n    a^\n    \u2192 d_i = a_(i + n - d)\n    \n     n\n, where \n    (i + n - d) \n     n\n is the remainder of integer\ndivision of \n    i + n - d\n by \n    n\n. It means that the whole array\n\n    a^\n    \u2192 d\n can be represented as a sequence\n\n    \n\n    a^\n    \u2192 d = [a_n - d, a_n - d + 1, \n    \u2026, a_n - 1,\n    a_0, a_1, \n    \u2026, a_n - d - 1]\n\n    \n Then each element of the array\n\n    a_i\n is replaced by \n    a_i \n     \n    &\n      a^\n    \u2192 d_i\n, where\n\n    &\n is a logical \"AND\" operator. For example, if \n    a = [0, 0, 1, 1]\n\nand \n    d = 1\n, then \n    a^\n    \u2192 d = [1, 0, 0, 1]\n and the value\nof \n    a\n after the first step will be \n    [0 \n     \n    &\n      1, 0 \n     \n    &\n     \n    0, 1 \n     \n    &\n      0, 1 \n     \n    &\n      1]\n, that is \n    [0, 0, 0, 1]\n. The\nprocess ends when the array stops changing. For a given array \n    a\n,\ndetermine whether it will consist of only zeros at the end of the process. If\nyes, also find the number of steps the process will take before it finishes.\nInput The first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next \n    2t\n lines contain\ndescriptions of the test cases. The first line of each test case description\ncontains two integers: \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 array size and\n\n    d\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 d \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 cyclic shift offset. The second line of\nthe description contains \n    n\n space-separated integers \n    a_i\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 1\n) \u2014 elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum\nof \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10^6\n. Output Print\n\n    t\n lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.\nThe answer to a test case should be a single integer \u2014 the number of steps\nafter which the array will contain only zeros for the first time. If there are\nstill elements equal to \n    1\n in the array after the end of the process,\nprint -1. Example Input 5 2 1 0 1 3 2 0 1 0 5 2 1 1 0 1 0 4 2 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\nOutput 1 1 3 -1 0 Note In the third sample test case the array will change as\nfollows: At the beginning \n    a = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n, and \n    a^\n    \u2192\n    2 = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n. Their element-by-element \"AND\" is equal to \n    \n\n    [1\n    \n     \n    &\n      1, 1 \n     \n    &\n      0, 0 \n     \n    &\n      1, 1 \n     \n    &\n      1, 0\n    \n     \n    &\n      0] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\n    \n Now \n    a = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n, then\n\n    a^\n    \u2192 2 = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n. Their element-by-element \"AND\"\nequals to \n    \n\n    [1 \n     \n    &\n      1, 0 \n     \n    &\n      0, 0 \n     \n    &\n      1, 1\n    \n     \n    &\n      0, 0 \n     \n    &\n      0] = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    \n And finally, when\n\n    a = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n we get \n    a^\n    \u2192 2 = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n.\nTheir element-by-element \"AND\" equals to \n    \n\n    [1 \n     \n    &\n      0, 0\n    \n     \n    &\n      0, 0 \n     \n    &\n      1, 0 \n     \n    &\n      0, 0 \n     \n    &\n      0] = [0, 0,\n    0, 0, 0]\n\n    \n Thus, the answer is \n    3\n steps.In the fourth sample test\ncase, the array will not change as it shifts by \n    2\n to the right, so each\nelement will be calculated as \n    0 \n     \n    &\n      0\n or \n    1 \n     \n    &\n      1\n\nthus not changing its value. So the answer is -1, the array will never contain\nonly zeros.\n\n",
