Each of the pupils has exactly one interesting book.\nThe pupils decided to share books with each other. Every day, all pupils give\ntheir own books to their best friends. Thus, every day each of the pupils has\nexactly one book. Your task is to use the list of the best friends and\ndetermine the exchange of books among pupils after k days. For simplicity, all\nstudents are numbered from 1 to n in all tests. Input The first line contains\ntwo integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^16) \u2014 the number of pupils\nand days during which they will exchange books. The second line contains n\ndifferent integers ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 n), where ai is equal to the number of the\npupil who has the best friend with the number i. It is guaranteed that no\npupil is the best friend of himself. Output In a single line print n different\nintegers, where i-th integer should be equal to the number of the pupil who\nwill have the book, which the pupil with the number i had in the beginning,\nafter k days. Examples Input 4 1 2 4 1 3 Output 3 1 4 2 Input 5 5 3 4 5 2 1\nOutput 3 4 5 2 1 Input 6 18 2 3 5 1 6 4 Output 1 2 3 4 5 6 Note The\nexplanation to the first test. There are 4 pupils and 1 day. The list of the\nbest friends equals to 2, 4, 1, 3. It means that: the pupil with the number\n3 \u2014 is the best friend of pupil with the number 1, the pupil with the number 1\n\u2014 is the best friend of pupil with the number 2, the pupil with the number 4 \u2014\nis the best friend of pupil with the number 3, the pupil with the number 2 \u2014\nis the best friend of pupil with the number 4. After the first day the\nexchange of books will be 3, 1, 4, 2. the pupil with the number 3 will have\nthe book, which the pupil with the number 1 had in the beginning, the pupil\nwith the number 1 will have the book, which the pupil with the number 2 had in\nthe beginning, the pupil with the number 4 will have the book, which the pupil\nwith the number 3 had in the beginning the pupil with the number 2 will have\nthe book, which the pupil with the number 4 had in the beginning. Thus, the\nanswer is 3 1 4 2.\n\n",
