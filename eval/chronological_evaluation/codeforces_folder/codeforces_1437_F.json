        "description": "\n    n\n fishermen have just returned from a fishing vacation. The \n    i\n-th\nfisherman has caught a fish of weight \n    a_i\n. Fishermen are going to show\noff the fish they caught to each other. To do so, they firstly choose an order\nin which they show their fish (each fisherman shows his fish exactly once, so,\nformally, the order of showing fish is a permutation of integers from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n). Then they show the fish they caught according to the chosen\norder. When a fisherman shows his fish, he might either become happy, become\nsad, or stay content. Suppose a fisherman shows a fish of weight \n    x\n, and\nthe maximum weight of a previously shown fish is \n    y\n (\n    y = 0\n if that\nfisherman is the first to show his fish). Then: if \n    x \n    \u2265 2y\n, the\nfisherman becomes happy; if \n    2x \n    \u2264 y\n, the fisherman becomes sad; if\nnone of these two conditions is met, the fisherman stays content. Let's call\nan order in which the fishermen show their fish emotional if, after all\nfishermen show their fish according to this order, each fisherman becomes\neither happy or sad. Calculate the number of emotional orders modulo\n\n    998244353\n. Input The first line contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264\n    n \n    \u2264 5000\n). The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1\n,\n\n    a_2\n, ..., \n    a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Output Print one\ninteger \u2014 the number of emotional orders, taken modulo \n    998244353\n.\nExamples Input 4 1 1 4 9 Output 20 Input 4 4 3 2 1 Output 0 Input 3 4 2 1\nOutput 6 Input 8 42 1337 13 37 420 666 616 97 Output 19200\n\n",
