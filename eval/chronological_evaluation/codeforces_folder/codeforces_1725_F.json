        "description": "Pak Chanek is traveling to Manado. It turns out that OSN (Indonesian National\nScientific Olympiad) 2019 is being held. The contestants of OSN 2019 are\ncurrently lining up in a field to be photographed. The field is shaped like a\ngrid of size \n    N \n    \u00d7 10^100\n with \n    N\n rows and \n    10^100\n\ncolumns. The rows are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    N\n from north to south,\nthe columns are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    10^100\n from west to east. The\ntile in row \n    r\n and column \n    c\n is denoted as \n    (r,c)\n. There are\n\n    N\n provinces that participate in OSN 2019. Initially, each contestant who\nrepresents province \n    i\n stands in tile \n    (i, p)\n for each \n    p\n\nsatisfying \n    L_i \n    \u2264 p \n    \u2264 R_i\n. So, we can see that there are\n\n    R_i-L_i+1\n contestants who represent province \n    i\n. Pak Chanek has a\nvariable \n    Z\n that is initially equal to \n    0\n. In one operation, Pak\nChanek can choose a row \n    i\n and a positive integer \n    k\n. Then, Pak\nChanek will do one of the two following possibilities: Move all contestants in\nrow \n    i\n exactly \n    k\n tiles to the west. In other words, a contestant\nwho is in \n    (i, p)\n is moved to \n    (i, p-k)\n. Move all contestants in row\n\n    i\n exactly \n    k\n tiles to the east. In other words, a contestant who is\nin \n    (i, p)\n is moved to \n    (i, p+k)\n. After each operation, the value of\n\n    Z\n will change into \n    Z \n     OR  k\n, with \n    OR\n being\nthe bitwise OR operation. Note that Pak Chanek can do operations to the same\nrow more than once. Also note that Pak Chanek is not allowed to move\ncontestants out of the grid. There are \n    Q\n questions. For the \n    j\n-th\nquestion, you are given a positive integer \n    W_j\n, Pak Chanek must do zero\nor more operations so that the final value of \n    Z\n is exactly \n    W_j\n.\nDefine \n    M\n as the biggest number such that after all operations, there is\nat least one column that contains exactly \n    M\n contestants. For each\nquestion, you must find the biggest possible \n    M\n for all sequences of\noperations that can be done by Pak Chanek. Note that the operations done by\nPak Chanek for one question do not carry over to other questions. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    N\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of rows in the grid and also the number of provinces that\nparticipate in OSN 2019. The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    N\n lines contains two\nintegers \n    L_i\n and \n    R_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 L_i \n    \u2264 R_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n)\ndescribing the positions of the contestants who represent province \n    i\n.\nThe next line contains a single integer \n    Q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 Q \n    \u2264 10^5\n)\n\u2014 the number of questions. The \n    j\n-th of the next \n    Q\n lines contains a\nsingle integer \n    W_j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 W_j \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the required final\nvalue of \n    Z\n for the \n    j\n-th question. Output Output \n    Q\n lines,\nwith the \n    j\n-th line containing an integer that is the answer to the\n\n    j\n-th question. Example Input 3 1 5 10 11 8 8 2 12 5 Output 2 3 Note For\nthe \n    1\n-st question, Pak Chanek can do the following operations to get\n\n    M=2\n: Move all contestants in row \n    2\n to the east by \n    4\n tiles.\n\n    Z\n changes into \n    0 \n     OR  4 = 4\n. Move all contestants in row\n\n    1\n to the east by \n    12\n tiles. \n    Z\n changes into \n    4 \n     OR \n    12 = 12\n. Now, columns \n    14\n and \n    15\n each contains exactly \n    2\n\ncontestants. For the \n    2\n-nd question, Pak Chanek can do the following\noperations to get \n    M=3\n: Move all contestants in row \n    3\n to the east\nby \n    4\n tiles. \n    Z\n changes into \n    0 \n     OR  4 = 4\n. Move all\ncontestants in row \n    3\n to the west by \n    1\n tiles. \n    Z\n changes into\n\n    4 \n     OR  1 = 5\n. Move all contestants in row \n    1\n to the east\nby \n    5\n tiles. \n    Z\n changes into \n    5 \n     OR  5 = 5\n. Move all\ncontestants in row \n    1\n to the east by \n    5\n tiles. \n    Z\n changes into\n\n    5 \n     OR  5 = 5\n. Now, column \n    11\n contains exactly \n    3\n\ncontestants. The following is an illustration of the example operations for\nthe \n    2\n-nd question.\n\n",
