        "description": "There is a colony of villains with several holes aligned in a row, where each\nhole contains exactly one villain. Each colony arrangement can be expressed as\na string of even length, where the \n    i\n-th character of the string\nrepresents the type of villain in the \n    i\n-th hole. Iron Man can destroy a\ncolony only if the colony arrangement is such that all villains of a certain\ntype either live in the first half of the colony or in the second half of the\ncolony. His assistant Jarvis has a special power. It can swap villains of any\ntwo holes, i.e. swap any two characters in the string; he can do this\noperation any number of times. Now Iron Man asks Jarvis \n    q\n questions. In\neach question, he gives Jarvis two numbers \n    x\n and \n    y\n. Jarvis has to\ntell Iron Man the number of distinct colony arrangements he can create from\nthe original one using his powers such that all villains having the same type\nas those originally living in \n    x\n-th hole or \n    y\n-th hole live in the\nsame half and the Iron Man can destroy that colony arrangement. Two colony\narrangements are considered to be different if there exists a hole such that\ndifferent types of villains are present in that hole in the arrangements.\nInput The first line contains a string \n    s\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 |s| \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n), representing the initial colony arrangement. String \n    s\n can\nhave both lowercase and uppercase English letters and its length is even. The\nsecond line contains a single integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of questions. The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    q\n lines contains two\nintegers \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i, y_i \n    \u2264 |s|\n, \n    x_i\n    \n     y_i\n) \u2014 the two numbers given to the Jarvis for the \n    i\n-th\nquestion. Output For each question output the number of arrangements possible\nmodulo \n    10^9+7\n. Examples Input abba 2 1 4 1 2 Output 2 0 Input AAaa 2 1 2\n1 3 Output 2 0 Input abcd 1 1 3 Output 8 Note Consider the first example. For\nthe first question, the possible arrangements are \"aabb\" and \"bbaa\", and for\nthe second question, index \n    1\n contains 'a' and index \n    2\n contains 'b'\nand there is no valid arrangement in which all 'a' and 'b' are in the same\nhalf.\n\n",
