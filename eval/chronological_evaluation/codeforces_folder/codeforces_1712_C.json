        "description": "An array is sorted if it has no inversions A Young Boy You are given an array\nof \n    n\n positive integers \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n. In one operation you\ndo the following: Choose any integer \n    x\n. For all \n    i\n such that \n    a_i\n    = x\n, do \n    a_i := 0\n (assign \n    0\n to \n    a_i\n). Find the minimum\nnumber of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order. Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of\ntest cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). Description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The second line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n positive integers \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    n\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not\nexceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case print one integer \u2014 the minimum\nnumber of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.\nExample Input 5 3 3 3 2 4 1 3 1 3 5 4 1 5 3 2 4 2 4 1 2 1 1 Output 1 2 4 3 0\nNote In the first test case, you can choose \n    x = 3\n for the operation, the\nresulting array is \n    [0, 0, 2]\n. In the second test case, you can choose\n\n    x = 1\n for the first operation and \n    x = 3\n for the second operation,\nthe resulting array is \n    [0, 0, 0, 0]\n.\n\n",
