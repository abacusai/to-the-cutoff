        "description": "The night after the graduation ceremony graduate students of German University\nin Cairo (GUC) are playing darts. As there's no real dart board available, the\nphotographs of members of the GUC upper management are being used. So, n\nrectangular photos are placed on the wall. They can overlap arbitrary and even\ncoincide. The photos are not necessarily placed horizontally or vertically,\nthey could also be rotated before being pinned to the wall. The score of one\ndart throw is simply the number of photos the dart went through. Fatma has\nmade a throw but her score was not recorded. She only remembers that she did\nmake it into at least one photo. Assuming that the probability distribution of\nthe throw is equal across the whole wall, what would be the expectation of\nFatma's score? Input The first line of input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 500)\n\u2014 the number of photos on the wall. Then follow n lines describing the photos,\neach containing 8 single-space-separated integers (coordinates of 4 vertices):\nx1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4. Each photo is a rectangle with a nonzero area.\nThe coordinates are integers, not exceeding 10^4 by absolute value. The\ncoordinates of the rectangle are given in either clockwise or counterclockwise\norder. Output Print the expected score of the throw. The answer will be\naccepted if it has absolute or relative error not exceeding 10^-6. Examples\nInput 1 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 Output 1.0000000000 Input 1 -1 0 0 1 1 0 0 -1 Output\n1.0000000000 Input 4 0 0 0 1 3 1 3 0 0 0 0 3 1 3 1 0 3 3 2 3 2 0 3 0 3 3 3 2 0\n2 0 3 Output 1.5000000000 Input 2 -1 0 0 1 1 0 0 -1 0 0 1 1 2 0 1 -1 Output\n1.1428571429\n\n",
