        "name": "Circular Maze",
        "description": "You are given a circular maze such as the ones shown in the figures. Determine\nif it can be solved, i.e., if there is a path which goes from the center to\nthe outside of the maze which does not touch any wall. The maze is described\nby \n    n\n walls. Each wall can be either circular or straight. Circular walls\nare described by a radius \n    r\n, the distance from the center, and two\nangles \n    \u03b8_1, \n    \u03b8_2\n describing the beginning and the end of\nthe wall in the clockwise direction. Notice that swapping the two angles\nchanges the wall. Straight walls are described by an angle \n    \u03b8\n, the\ndirection of the wall, and two radii \n    r_1 < r_2\n describing the beginning\nand the end of the wall. Angles are measured in degrees; the angle \n    0\n\ncorresponds to the upward pointing direction; and angles increase clockwise\n(hence the east direction corresponds to the angle \n    90\n). Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 20\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The descriptions of the\n\n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the number of walls. Each of\nthe following \n    n\n lines each contains a character (C for circular, and S\nfor straight) and three integers: either \n    r, \n    \u03b8_1, \n    \u03b8_2\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 20\n and \n    0 \n    \u2264\n    \u03b8_1,\n    \u03b8_2 < 360\n with\n\n    \u03b8_1 \n    \u2260\n    \u03b8_2\n) if the wall is circular, or \n    r_1\n,\n\n    r_2\n and \n    \u03b8\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 r_1 < r_2 \n    \u2264 20\n and \n    0\n    \n    \u2264\n    \u03b8 < 360\n) if the wall is straight. It is guaranteed that\ncircular walls do not overlap (but two circular walls may intersect at one or\ntwo points), and that straight walls do not overlap (but two straight walls\nmay intersect at one point). However, circular and straight walls can\nintersect arbitrarily. Output For each test case, print YES if the maze can be\nsolved and NO otherwise. Example Input 2 5 C 1 180 90 C 5 250 230 C 10 150 140\nC 20 185 180 S 1 20 180 6 C 1 180 90 C 5 250 230 C 10 150 140 C 20 185 180 S 1\n20 180 S 5 10 0 Output YES NO Note The two sample test cases correspond to the\ntwo mazes in the picture.\n\n",
