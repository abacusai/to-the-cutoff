        "description": "Alice has recently received an array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n for her\nbirthday! She is very proud of her array, and when she showed her friend Bob\nthe array, he was very happy with her present too! However, soon Bob became\ncurious, and as any sane friend would do, asked Alice to perform \n    q\n\noperations of two types on her array: \n    1\n \n    x\n \n    y\n: update the\nelement \n    a_x\n to \n    y\n (set \n    a_x = y\n). \n    2\n \n    l\n \n    r\n:\ncalculate how many non-decreasing subarrays exist within the subarray \n    [a_l,\n    a_l+1, \n    \u2026, a_r]\n. More formally, count the number of pairs of\nintegers \n    (p,q)\n such that \n    l \n    \u2264 p \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 r\n and \n    a_p\n    \n    \u2264 a_p+1\n    \u2264\n    \u2026\n    \u2264 a_q-1\n    \u2264 a_q\n. Help Alice answer\nBob's queries! Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    q\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, q \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the size of the array, and the\nnumber of queries, respectively. The second line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the elements of\nAlice's array. The next \n    q\n lines consist of three integers each. The\nfirst integer of the \n    i\n-th line is \n    t_i\n, the operation being\nperformed on the \n    i\n-th step (\n    t_i = 1\n or \n    t_i = 2\n). If \n    t_i =\n    1\n, the next two integers are \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264\n    n\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 y_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), updating the element at position\n\n    x_i\n to \n    y_i\n (setting \n    a_x_i = y_i\n). If \n    t_i = 2\n, the\nnext two integers are \n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264\n    n\n), the two indices Bob asks Alice about for the \n    i\n-th query. It's\nguaranteed that there is at least one operation of the second type. Output For\neach query of type \n    2\n, print a single integer, the answer to the query.\nExample Input 5 6 3 1 4 1 5 2 2 5 2 1 3 1 4 4 2 2 5 1 2 6 2 2 5 Output 6 4 10\n7 Note For the first query, \n    l = 2\n and \n    r = 5\n, and the non-\ndecreasing subarrays \n    [p,q]\n are \n    [2,2]\n, \n    [3,3]\n, \n    [4,4]\n,\n\n    [5,5]\n, \n    [2,3]\n and \n    [4,5]\n.\n\n",
