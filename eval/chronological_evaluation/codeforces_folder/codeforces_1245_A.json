        "description": "Consider the set of all nonnegative integers: \n    0, 1, 2, \n    \u2026\n. Given\ntwo integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 10^4\n). We paint all\nthe numbers in increasing number first we paint \n    0\n, then we paint\n\n    1\n, then \n    2\n and so on. Each number is painted white or black. We\npaint a number \n    i\n according to the following rules: if \n    i = 0\n, it is\ncolored white; if \n    i \n    \u2265 a\n and \n    i - a\n is colored white, \n    i\n is\nalso colored white; if \n    i \n    \u2265 b\n and \n    i - b\n is colored white,\n\n    i\n is also colored white; if \n    i\n is still not colored white, it is\ncolored black. In this way, each nonnegative integer gets one of two colors.\nFor example, if \n    a=3\n, \n    b=5\n, then the colors of the numbers (in the\norder from \n    0\n) are: white (\n    0\n), black (\n    1\n), black (\n    2\n),\nwhite (\n    3\n), black (\n    4\n), white (\n    5\n), white (\n    6\n), black\n(\n    7\n), white (\n    8\n), white (\n    9\n), ... Note that: It is possible\nthat there are infinitely many nonnegative integers colored black. For\nexample, if \n    a = 10\n and \n    b = 10\n, then only \n    0, 10, 20, 30\n and\nany other nonnegative integers that end in \n    0\n when written in base 10 are\nwhite. The other integers are colored black. It is also possible that there\nare only finitely many nonnegative integers colored black. For example, when\n\n    a = 1\n and \n    b = 10\n, then there is no nonnegative integer colored\nblack at all. Your task is to determine whether or not the number of\nnonnegative integers colored black is infinite. If there are infinitely many\nnonnegative integers colored black, simply print a line containing \"Infinite\"\n(without the quotes). Otherwise, print \"Finite\" (without the quotes). Input\nThe first line of input contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then \n    t\n lines follow,\neach line contains two space-separated integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 10^4\n). Output For each test case, print one line\ncontaining either \"Infinite\" or \"Finite\" (without the quotes). Output is case-\ninsensitive (i.e. \"infinite\", \"inFiNite\" or \"finiTE\" are all valid answers).\nExample Input 4 10 10 1 10 6 9 7 3 Output Infinite Finite Infinite Finite\n\n",
