        "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game with a string of characters, with Alice going\nfirst. The string consists n characters, each of which is one of the first k\nletters of the alphabet. On a player\u2019s turn, they can either arbitrarily\npermute the characters in the words, or delete exactly one character in the\nword (if there is at least one character). In addition, their resulting word\ncannot have appeared before throughout the entire game. The player unable to\nmake a valid move loses the game. Given n, k, p, find the number of words with\nexactly n characters consisting of the first k letters of the alphabet such\nthat Alice will win if both Alice and Bob play optimally. Return this number\nmodulo the prime number p. Input The first line of input will contain three\nintegers n, k, p (1 \u2264 n \u2264 250 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 26, 10^8 \u2264 p \u2264 10^9 + 100, p will\nbe prime). Output Print a single integer, the number of winning words for\nAlice, modulo p. Example Input 4 2 100000007 Output 14 Note There are 14\nstrings that that Alice can win with. For example, some strings are \"bbaa\" and\n\"baaa\". Alice will lose on strings like \"aaaa\" or \"bbbb\".\n\n",
