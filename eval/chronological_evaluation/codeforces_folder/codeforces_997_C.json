        "description": "On one of the planets of Solar system, in Atmosphere University, many students\nare fans of bingo game. It is well known that one month on this planet\nconsists of \n    n^2\n days, so calendars, represented as square matrix \n    n\n\nby \n    n\n are extremely popular. Weather conditions are even more unusual.\nDue to the unique composition of the atmosphere, when interacting with\nsunlight, every day sky takes one of three colors: blue, green or red. To play\nthe bingo, you need to observe the sky for one month \u2014 after each day, its\ncell is painted with the color of the sky in that day, that is, blue, green or\nred. At the end of the month, students examine the calendar. If at least one\nrow or column contains only cells of one color, that month is called lucky.\nLet's call two colorings of calendar different, if at least one cell has\ndifferent colors in them. It is easy to see that there are \n    3^n \n    \u00b7\n    n\n different colorings. How much of them are lucky? Since this number can\nbe quite large, print it modulo \n    998244353\n. Input The first and only line\nof input contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n     000\n)\n\u2014 the number of rows and columns in the calendar. Output Print one number \u2014\nnumber of lucky colorings of the calendar modulo \n    998244353\n Examples\nInput 1 Output 3 Input 2 Output 63 Input 3 Output 9933 Note In the first\nsample any coloring is lucky, since the only column contains cells of only one\ncolor. In the second sample, there are a lot of lucky colorings, in\nparticular, the following colorings are lucky: While these colorings are not\nlucky:\n\n",
