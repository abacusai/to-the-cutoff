        "description": "Tema loves cinnabon rolls \u2014 buns with cinnabon and chocolate in the shape of a\n\"snail\". Cinnabon rolls come in different sizes and are square when viewed\nfrom above. The most delicious part of a roll is the chocolate, which is\npoured in a thin layer over the cinnabon roll in the form of a spiral and\naround the bun, as in the following picture: Cinnabon rolls of sizes 4, 5, 6\nFor a cinnabon roll of size \n    n\n, the length of the outer side of the\nsquare is \n    n\n, and the length of the shortest vertical chocolate segment\nin the central part is one. Formally, the bun consists of two dough spirals\nseparated by chocolate. A cinnabon roll of size \n    n + 1\n is obtained from a\ncinnabon roll of size \n    n\n by wrapping each of the dough spirals around the\ncinnabon roll for another layer. It is important that a cinnabon roll of size\n\n    n\n is defined in a unique way. Tema is interested in how much chocolate\nis in his cinnabon roll of size \n    n\n. Since Tema has long stopped buying\nsmall cinnabon rolls, it is guaranteed that \n    n \n    \u2265 4\n. Answer this non-\nobvious question by calculating the total length of the chocolate layer. Input\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The following \n    t\n lines\ndescribe the test cases. Each test case is described by a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    4 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the size of the cinnabon roll. Output\nOutput \n    t\n integers. The \n    i\n-th of them should be equal to the total\nlength of the chocolate layer in the \n    i\n-th test case.
