        "description": "Roy and Biv have a set of n points on the infinite number line. Each point has\none of 3 colors: red, green, or blue. Roy and Biv would like to connect all\nthe points with some edges. Edges can be drawn between any of the two of the\ngiven points. The cost of an edge is equal to the distance between the two\npoints it connects. They want to do this in such a way that they will both see\nthat all the points are connected (either directly or indirectly). However,\nthere is a catch: Roy cannot see the color red and Biv cannot see the color\nblue. Therefore, they have to choose the edges in such a way that if all the\nred points are removed, the remaining blue and green points are connected (and\nsimilarly, if all the blue points are removed, the remaining red and green\npoints are connected). Help them compute the minimum cost way to choose edges\nto satisfy the above constraints. Input The first line will contain an integer\nn (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300 000), the number of points. The next n lines will contain two\ntokens pi and ci (pi is an integer, 1 \u2264 pi \u2264 10^9, ci is a uppercase English\nletter 'R', 'G' or 'B'), denoting the position of the i-th point and the color\nof the i-th point. 'R' means red, 'G' denotes green, and 'B' means blue. The\npositions will be in strictly increasing order. Output Print a single integer,\nthe minimum cost way to solve the problem. Examples Input 4 1 G 5 R 10 B 15 G\nOutput 23 Input 4 1 G 2 R 3 B 10 G Output 12 Note In the first sample, it is\noptimal to draw edges between the points (1,2), (1,4), (3,4). These have costs\n4, 14, 5, respectively.\n\n",
