        "description": "Tanya is learning how to add numbers, but so far she is not doing it\ncorrectly. She is adding two numbers \n    a\n and \n    b\n using the following\nalgorithm: If one of the numbers is shorter than the other, Tanya adds leading\nzeros so that the numbers are the same length. The numbers are processed from\nright to left (that is, from the least significant digits to the most\nsignificant). In the first step, she adds the last digit of \n    a\n to the\nlast digit of \n    b\n and writes their sum in the answer. At each next step,\nshe performs the same operation on each pair of digits in the same place and\nwrites the result to the left side of the answer. For example, the numbers\n\n    a = 17236\n and \n    b = 3465\n Tanya adds up as follows: \n    \n\n    [                                 +; [ 17236; ; ; 03465; ; ;      ;  ]; ; ;                                  ;                                  ;                     [ 1106911;  ];  ]\n\n    \n calculates the sum of \n    6 + 5 = 11\n and writes\n\n    11\n in the answer. calculates the sum of \n    3 + 6 = 9\n and writes the\nresult to the left side of the answer to get \n    911\n. calculates the sum of\n\n    2 + 4 = 6\n and writes the result to the left side of the answer to get\n\n    6911\n. calculates the sum of \n    7 + 3 = 10\n, and writes the result to\nthe left side of the answer to get \n    106911\n. calculates the sum of \n    1 +\n    0 = 1\n and writes the result to the left side of the answer and get\n\n    1106911\n. As a result, she gets \n    1106911\n. You are given two positive\nintegers \n    a\n and \n    s\n. Find the number \n    b\n such that by adding\n\n    a\n and \n    b\n as described above, Tanya will get \n    s\n. Or determine\nthat no suitable \n    b\n exists. Input The first line of input data contains\nan integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of a single line containing two positive integers\n\n    a\n and \n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a \n     s \n    \u2264 10^18\n) separated by a\nspace. Output For each test case print the answer on a separate line. If the\nsolution exists, print a single positive integer \n    b\n. The answer must be\nwritten without leading zeros. If multiple answers exist, print any of them.\nIf no suitable number \n    b\n exists, output -1. Example Input 6 17236 1106911\n1 5 108 112 12345 1023412 1 11 1 20 Output 3465 4 -1 90007 10 -1 Note The\nfirst test case is explained in the main part of the statement. In the third\ntest case, we cannot choose \n    b\n that satisfies the problem statement.\n\n",
