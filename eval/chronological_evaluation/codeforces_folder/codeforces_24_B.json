It is guaranteed,\nthat both systems will produce unique champion. Input The first line contain\ninteger t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 20), where t is the number of races. After that all races\nare described one by one. Every race description start with an integer n (1 \u2264\nn \u2264 50) on a line of itself, where n is the number of clasified drivers in the\ngiven race. After that n lines follow with the classification for the race,\neach containing the name of a driver. The names of drivers are given in order\nfrom the first to the last place.
