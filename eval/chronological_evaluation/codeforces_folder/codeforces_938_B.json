        "description": "You and your friend are participating in a TV show \"Run For Your Prize\". At\nthe start of the show n prizes are located on a straight line. i-th prize is\nlocated at position ai. Positions of all prizes are distinct. You start at\nposition 1, your friend \u2014 at position 10^6 (and there is no prize in any of\nthese two positions). You have to work as a team and collect all prizes in\nminimum possible time, in any order. You know that it takes exactly 1 second\nto move from position x to position x + 1 or x - 1, both for you and your\nfriend. You also have trained enough to instantly pick up any prize, if its\nposition is equal to your current position (and the same is true for your\nfriend). Carrying prizes does not affect your speed (or your friend's speed)\nat all. Now you may discuss your strategy with your friend and decide who will\npick up each prize. Remember that every prize must be picked up, either by you\nor by your friend. What is the minimum number of seconds it will take to pick\nup all the prizes? Input The first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5)\n\u2014 the number of prizes. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (2\n\u2264 ai \u2264 10^6 - 1) \u2014 the positions of the prizes. No two prizes are located at\nthe same position. Positions are given in ascending order. Output Print one\ninteger \u2014 the minimum number of seconds it will take to collect all prizes.\nExamples Input 3 2 3 9 Output 8 Input 2 2 999995 Output 5 Note In the first\nexample you take all the prizes: take the first at 1, the second at 2 and the\nthird at 8. In the second example you take the first prize in 1 second and\nyour friend takes the other in 5 seconds, you do this simultaneously, so the\ntotal time is 5.\n\n",
