        "name": "Dividing Island",
        "description": "A revolution took place on the Buka Island. New government replaced the old\none. The new government includes n parties and each of them is entitled to\nsome part of the island according to their contribution to the revolution.\nHowever, they can't divide the island. The island can be conventionally\nrepresented as two rectangles a \u00d7 b and c \u00d7 d unit squares in size\ncorrespondingly. The rectangles are located close to each other. At that, one\nof the sides with the length of a and one of the sides with the length of c\nlie on one line. You can see this in more details on the picture. The i-th\nparty is entitled to a part of the island equal to xi unit squares. Every such\npart should fully cover several squares of the island (it is not allowed to\ncover the squares partially) and be a connected figure. A \"connected figure\"\npresupposes that from any square of this party one can move to any other\nsquare of the same party moving through edge-adjacent squares also belonging\nto that party. Your task is to divide the island between parties. Input The\nfirst line contains 5 space-separated integers \u2014 a, b, c, d and n (1 \u2264 a, b,\nc, d \u2264 50, b \u2260 d, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 26). The second line contains n space-separated\nnumbers. The i-th of them is equal to number xi (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 a \u00d7 b + c \u00d7 d). It\nis guaranteed that . Output If dividing the island between parties in the\nrequired manner is impossible, print \"NO\" (without the quotes). Otherwise,\nprint \"YES\" (also without the quotes) and, starting from the next line, print\nmax(b, d) lines each containing a + c characters. To mark what square should\nbelong to what party, use lowercase Latin letters. For the party that is first\nin order in the input data, use \"a\", for the second one use \"b\" and so on. Use\n\".\" for the squares that belong to the sea. The first symbol of the second\nline of the output data should correspond to the square that belongs to the\nrectangle a \u00d7 b. The last symbol of the second line should correspond to the\nsquare that belongs to the rectangle c \u00d7 d. If there are several solutions\noutput any. Examples Input 3 4 2 2 3 5 8 3 Output YES aaabb aabbb cbb.. ccb..\nInput 3 2 1 4 4 1 2 3 4 Output YES abbd cccd ...d ...d\n\n",
