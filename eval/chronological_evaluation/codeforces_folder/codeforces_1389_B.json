        "description": "You are given an array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n, consisting of \n    n\n\npositive integers. Initially you are standing at index \n    1\n and have a\nscore equal to \n    a_1\n. You can perform two kinds of moves: move right \u2014 go\nfrom your current index \n    x\n to \n    x+1\n and add \n    a_x+1\n to your\nscore. This move can only be performed if \n    x1\n. Also, you can't perform\ntwo or more moves to the left in a row. You want to perform exactly \n    k\n\nmoves. Also, there should be no more than \n    z\n moves to the left among\nthem. What is the maximum score you can achieve? Input The first line contains\na single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntestcases. The first line of each testcase contains three integers \n    n, k\n\nand \n    z\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n - 1\n, \n    0\n    \n    \u2264 z \n    \u2264 min(5, k)\n) \u2014 the number of elements in the array, the total\nnumber of moves you should perform and the maximum number of moves to the left\nyou can perform. The second line of each testcase contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the given array.\nThe sum of \n    n\n over all testcases does not exceed \n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n.\nOutput Print \n    t\n integers \u2014 for each testcase output the maximum score you\ncan achieve if you make exactly \n    k\n moves in total, no more than \n    z\n\nof them are to the left and there are no two or more moves to the left in a\nrow. Example Input 4 5 4 0 1 5 4 3 2 5 4 1 1 5 4 3 2 5 4 4 10 20 30 40 50 10 7\n3 4 6 8 2 9 9 7 4 10 9 Output 15 19 150 56 Note In the first testcase you are\nnot allowed to move left at all. So you make four moves to the right and\nobtain the score \n    a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5\n. In the second example you\ncan move one time to the left. So we can follow these moves: right, right,\nleft, right. The score will be \n    a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_2 + a_3\n. In the third\nexample you can move four times to the left but it's not optimal anyway, you\ncan just move four times to the right and obtain the score \n    a_1 + a_2 + a_3\n    + a_4 + a_5\n.\n\n",
