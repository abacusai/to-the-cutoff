        "description": "The spring is coming and it means that a lot of fruits appear on the counters.\nOne sunny day little boy Valera decided to go shopping. He made a list of m\nfruits he wanted to buy. If Valera want to buy more than one fruit of some\nkind, he includes it into the list several times. When he came to the fruit\nstall of Ashot, he saw that the seller hadn't distributed price tags to the\ngoods, but put all price tags on the counter. Later Ashot will attach every\nprice tag to some kind of fruits, and Valera will be able to count the total\nprice of all fruits from his list. But Valera wants to know now what can be\nthe smallest total price (in case of the most \u00ablucky\u00bb for him distribution of\nprice tags) and the largest total price (in case of the most \u00abunlucky\u00bb for him\ndistribution of price tags). Input The first line of the input contains two\ninteger number n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of price tags (which is\nequal to the number of different kinds of fruits that Ashot sells) and the\nnumber of items in Valera's list. The second line contains n space-separated\npositive integer numbers. Each of them doesn't exceed 100 and stands for the\nprice of one fruit of some kind. The following m lines contain names of the\nfruits from the list. Each name is a non-empty string of small Latin letters\nwhich length doesn't exceed 32. It is guaranteed that the number of distinct\nfruits from the list is less of equal to n. Also it is known that the seller\nhas in stock all fruits that Valera wants to buy. Output Print two numbers a\nand b (a \u2264 b) \u2014 the minimum and the maximum possible sum which Valera may need\nto buy all fruits from his list. Examples Input 5 3 4 2 1 10 5 apple orange\nmango Output 7 19 Input 6 5 3 5 1 6 8 1 peach grapefruit banana orange orange\nOutput 11 30\n\n",
