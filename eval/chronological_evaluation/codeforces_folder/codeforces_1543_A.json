        "description": "Welcome to Rockport City! It is time for your first ever race in the game\nagainst Ronnie. To make the race interesting, you have bet \n    a\n dollars and\nRonnie has bet \n    b\n dollars. But the fans seem to be disappointed. The\nexcitement of the fans is given by \n    gcd(a,b)\n, where \n    gcd(x, y)\n\ndenotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n. To\nmake the race more exciting, you can perform two types of operations: Increase\nboth \n    a\n and \n    b\n by \n    1\n. Decrease both \n    a\n and \n    b\n by\n\n    1\n. This operation can only be performed if both \n    a\n and \n    b\n are\ngreater than \n    0\n. In one move, you can perform any one of these\noperations. You can perform arbitrary (possibly zero) number of moves.\nDetermine the maximum excitement the fans can get and the minimum number of\nmoves required to achieve it. Note that \n    gcd(x,0)=x\n for any \n    x \n    \u2265\n    0\n. Input The first line of input contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 5\n    \u00b7 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first\nand the only line of each test case contains two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n\n(\n    0\n    \u2264 a, b\n    \u2264 10^18\n). Output For each test case, print a single\nline containing two integers. If the fans can get infinite excitement, print 0\n0. Otherwise, the first integer must be the maximum excitement the fans can\nget, and the second integer must be the minimum number of moves required to\nachieve that excitement. Example Input 4 8 5 1 2 4 4 3 9 Output 3 1 1 0 0 0 6\n3 Note For the first test case, you can apply the first operation \n    1\n time\nto get \n    a=9\n and \n    b=6\n. It can be shown that \n    3\n is the maximum\nexcitement possible. For the second test case, no matter how many operations\nyou apply, the fans will always have an excitement equal to \n    1\n. Since the\ninitial excitement is also \n    1\n, you don't need to apply any operation. For\nthe third case, the fans can get infinite excitement by applying the first\noperation an infinite amount of times. For the fourth test case, you can apply\nthe second operation \n    3\n times to get \n    a=0\n and \n    b=6\n. Since,\n\n    gcd(0,6)=6\n, the fans will get an excitement of \n    6\n.\n\n",
