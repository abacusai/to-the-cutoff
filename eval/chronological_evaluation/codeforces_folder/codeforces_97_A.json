        "description": "Little Gennady was presented with a set of domino for his birthday. The set\nconsists of 28 different dominoes of size 2 \u00d7 1. Both halves of each domino\ncontain one digit from 0 to 6. 0-0 0-1 0-2 0-3 0-4 0-5 0-6 1-1 1-2 1-3 1-4 1-5\n1-6 2-2 2-3 2-4 2-5 2-6 3-3 3-4 3-5 3-6 4-4 4-5 4-6 5-5 5-6 6-6 The figure\nthat consists of 28 dominoes is called magic, if it can be fully covered with\n14 non-intersecting squares of size 2 \u00d7 2 so that each square contained four\nequal numbers. Every time Gennady assembles a magic figure, some magic\nproperties of the set appear \u2014 he wins the next contest. Gennady noticed that\nhe can't assemble a figure that has already been assembled, otherwise someone\nelse wins the contest. Gennady chose a checked field of size n \u00d7 m and put\nthere rectangular chips of sizes 1 \u00d7 2 and 2 \u00d7 1. Each chip fully occupies\nexactly two neighboring squares of the field. Those chips do not overlap but\nthey can touch each other. Overall the field has exactly 28 chips, equal to\nthe number of dominoes in the set. Now Gennady wants to replace each chip with\na domino so that a magic figure appeared as a result. Different chips should\nbe replaced by different dominoes. Determine in what number of contests\nGennady can win over at the given position of the chips. You are also required\nto find one of the possible ways of replacing chips with dominoes to win the\nnext Codeforces round. Input The first line contains two positive integers n\nand m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 30). Each of the following n lines contains m characters,\nwhich is the position of chips on the field. The dots stand for empty spaces,\nLatin letters from \"a\" to \"z\" and \"A\", \"B\" stand for the positions of the\nchips. There are exactly 28 chips on the field. The squares covered by the\nsame chip are marked by the same letter, different chips are marked by\ndifferent letters. It is guaranteed that the field's description is correct.\nIt is also guaranteed that at least one solution exists. Output Print on the\nfirst line the number of ways to replace chips with dominoes to get a magic\nfigure. That is the total number of contests that can be won using this\narrangement of the chips. Next n lines containing m characters each, should\ncontain a field from dots and numbers from 0 to 6 \u2014 any of the possible\nsolutions. All dominoes should be different.
