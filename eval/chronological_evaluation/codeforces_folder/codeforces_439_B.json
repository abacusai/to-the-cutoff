        "description": "Devu is a dumb guy, his learning curve is very slow. You are supposed to teach\nhim n subjects, the i^th subject has ci chapters. When you teach him, you are\nsupposed to teach all the chapters of a subject continuously. Let us say that\nhis initial per chapter learning power of a subject is x hours. In other words\nhe can learn a chapter of a particular subject in x hours. Well Devu is not\ncomplete dumb, there is a good thing about him too. If you teach him a\nsubject, then time required to teach any chapter of the next subject will\nrequire exactly 1 hour less than previously required (see the examples to\nunderstand it more clearly). Note that his per chapter learning power can not\nbe less than 1 hour. You can teach him the n subjects in any possible order.\nFind out minimum amount of time (in hours) Devu will take to understand all\nthe subjects and you will be free to do some enjoying task rather than\nteaching a dumb guy. Please be careful that answer might not fit in 32 bit\ndata type. Input The first line will contain two space separated integers n, x\n(1 \u2264 n, x \u2264 10^5). The next line will contain n space separated integers: c1,\nc2, ..., cn (1 \u2264 ci \u2264 10^5). Output Output a single integer representing the\nanswer to the problem. Examples Input 2 3 4 1 Output 11 Input 4 2 5 1 2 1\nOutput 10 Input 3 3 1 1 1 Output 6 Note Look at the first example. Consider\nthe order of subjects: 1, 2. When you teach Devu the first subject, it will\ntake him 3 hours per chapter, so it will take 12 hours to teach first subject.\nAfter teaching first subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours.\nNow teaching him second subject will take 2 \u00d7 1 = 2 hours. Hence you will need\nto spend 12 + 2 = 14 hours. Consider the order of subjects: 2, 1. When you\nteach Devu the second subject, then it will take him 3 hours per chapter, so\nit will take 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 hours to teach the second subject. After teaching the\nsecond subject, his per chapter learning time will be 2 hours. Now teaching\nhim the first subject will take 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 hours. Hence you will need to spend\n11 hours. So overall, minimum of both the cases is 11 hours. Look at the third\nexample. The order in this example doesn't matter. When you teach Devu the\nfirst subject, it will take him 3 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the\nsecond subject, it will take him 2 hours per chapter. When you teach Devu the\nthird subject, it will take him 1 hours per chapter. In total it takes 6\nhours.\n\n",
