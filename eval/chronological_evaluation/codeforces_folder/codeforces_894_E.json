        "name": "Ralph and Mushrooms",
        "description": "Ralph is going to collect mushrooms in the Mushroom Forest. There are m\ndirected paths connecting n trees in the Mushroom Forest. On each path grow\nsome mushrooms. When Ralph passes a path, he collects all the mushrooms on the\npath. The Mushroom Forest has a magical fertile ground where mushrooms grow at\na fantastic speed. New mushrooms regrow as soon as Ralph finishes mushroom\ncollection on a path. More specifically, after Ralph passes a path the i-th\ntime, there regrow i mushrooms less than there was before this pass. That is,\nif there is initially x mushrooms on a path, then Ralph will collect x\nmushrooms for the first time, x - 1 mushrooms the second time, x - 1 - 2\nmushrooms the third time, and so on. However, the number of mushrooms can\nnever be less than 0. For example, let there be 9 mushrooms on a path\ninitially. The number of mushrooms that can be collected from the path is 9,\n8, 6 and 3 when Ralph passes by from first to fourth time. From the fifth time\nand later Ralph can't collect any mushrooms from the path (but still can pass\nit). Ralph decided to start from the tree s. How many mushrooms can he collect\nusing only described paths? Input The first line contains two integers n and m\n(1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 10^6), representing the number of trees and the number\nof directed paths in the Mushroom Forest, respectively. Each of the following\nm lines contains three integers x, y and w (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 w \u2264 10^8),\ndenoting a path that leads from tree x to tree y with w mushrooms initially.\nThere can be paths that lead from a tree to itself, and multiple paths between\nthe same pair of trees. The last line contains a single integer s (1 \u2264 s \u2264 n)\n\u2014 the starting position of Ralph. Output Print an integer denoting the maximum\nnumber of the mushrooms Ralph can collect during his route. Examples Input 2 2\n1 2 4 2 1 4 1 Output 16 Input 3 3 1 2 4 2 3 3 1 3 8 1 Output 8 Note In the\nfirst sample Ralph can pass three times on the circle and collect 4 + 4 + 3 +\n3 + 1 + 1 = 16 mushrooms. After that there will be no mushrooms for Ralph to\ncollect. In the second sample, Ralph can go to tree 3 and collect 8 mushrooms\non the path from tree 1 to tree 3.\n\n",
