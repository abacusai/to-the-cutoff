        "description": "Vasilisa the Wise from the Kingdom of Far Far Away got a magic box with a\nsecret as a present from her friend Hellawisa the Wise from the Kingdom of A\nLittle Closer. However, Vasilisa the Wise does not know what the box's secret\nis, since she cannot open it again. She hopes that you will help her one more\ntime with that. The box's lock looks as follows: it contains 4 identical\ndeepenings for gems as a 2 \u00d7 2 square, and some integer numbers are written at\nthe lock's edge near the deepenings. The example of a lock is given on the\npicture below. The box is accompanied with 9 gems. Their shapes match the\ndeepenings' shapes and each gem contains one number from 1 to 9 (each number\nis written on exactly one gem). The box will only open after it is decorated\nwith gems correctly: that is, each deepening in the lock should be filled with\nexactly one gem. Also, the sums of numbers in the square's rows, columns and\ntwo diagonals of the square should match the numbers written at the lock's\nedge. For example, the above lock will open if we fill the deepenings with\ngems with numbers as is shown on the picture below. Now Vasilisa the Wise\nwants to define, given the numbers on the box's lock, which gems she should\nput in the deepenings to open the box. Help Vasilisa to solve this challenging\ntask. Input The input contains numbers written on the edges of the lock of the\nbox. The first line contains space-separated integers r1 and r2 that define\nthe required sums of numbers in the rows of the square. The second line\ncontains space-separated integers c1 and c2 that define the required sums of\nnumbers in the columns of the square. The third line contains space-separated\nintegers d1 and d2 that define the required sums of numbers on the main and on\nthe side diagonals of the square (1 \u2264 r1, r2, c1, c2, d1, d2 \u2264 20).\nCorrespondence between the above 6 variables and places where they are written\nis shown on the picture below. For more clarifications please look at the\nsecond sample test that demonstrates the example given in the problem\nstatement. Output Print the scheme of decorating the box with stones: two\nlines containing two space-separated integers from 1 to 9. The numbers should\nbe pairwise different. If there is no solution for the given lock, then print\nthe single number \"-1\" (without the quotes). If there are several solutions,\noutput any. Examples Input 3 7 4 6 5 5 Output 1 2 3 4 Input 11 10 13 8 5 16\nOutput 4 7 9 1 Input 1 2 3 4 5 6 Output -1 Input 10 10 10 10 10 10 Output -1\nNote Pay attention to the last test from the statement: it is impossible to\nopen the box because for that Vasilisa the Wise would need 4 identical gems\ncontaining number \"5\". However, Vasilisa only has one gem with each number\nfrom 1 to 9.\n\n",
