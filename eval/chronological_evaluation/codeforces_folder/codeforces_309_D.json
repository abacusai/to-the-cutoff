        "description": "Professional sport is more than hard work. It also is the equipment, designed\nby top engineers. As an example, let's take tennis. Not only should you be in\ngreat shape, you also need an excellent racket! In this problem your task is\nto contribute to the development of tennis and to help to design a\nrevolutionary new concept of a racket! The concept is a triangular racket. Ant\nit should be not just any triangle, but a regular one. As soon as you've\nchosen the shape, you need to stretch the net. By the time you came the rocket\nhad n holes drilled on each of its sides. The holes divide each side into\nequal n + 1 parts. At that, the m closest to each apex holes on each side are\nmade for better ventilation only and you cannot stretch the net through them.\nThe next revolutionary idea as to stretch the net as obtuse triangles through\nthe holes, so that for each triangle all apexes lay on different sides.\nMoreover, you need the net to be stretched along every possible obtuse\ntriangle. That's where we need your help \u2014 help us to count the number of\ntriangles the net is going to consist of. Two triangles are considered to be\ndifferent if their pictures on the fixed at some position racket are\ndifferent. Input The first and the only input line contains two integers n, m\n. Output Print a single number \u2014 the answer to the problem. Examples Input 3 0\nOutput 9 Input 4 0 Output 24 Input 10 1 Output 210 Input 8 4 Output 0 Note For\nthe following picture n = 8, m = 2. White circles are the holes for\nventilation, red circles \u2014 holes for net stretching. One of the possible\nobtuse triangles is painted red.\n\n",
