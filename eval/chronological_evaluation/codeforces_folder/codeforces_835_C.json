        "description": "The Cartesian coordinate system is set in the sky. There you can see n stars,\nthe i-th has coordinates (xi, yi), a maximum brightness c, equal for all\nstars, and an initial brightness si (0 \u2264 si \u2264 c). Over time the stars twinkle.\nAt moment 0 the i-th star has brightness si. Let at moment t some star has\nbrightness x. Then at moment (t + 1) this star will have brightness x + 1, if\nx + 1 \u2264 c, and 0, otherwise. You want to look at the sky q times. In the i-th\ntime you will look at the moment ti and you will see a rectangle with sides\nparallel to the coordinate axes, the lower left corner has coordinates (x1i,\ny1i) and the upper right \u2014 (x2i, y2i). For each view, you want to know the\ntotal brightness of the stars lying in the viewed rectangle. A star lies in a\nrectangle if it lies on its border or lies strictly inside it. Input The first\nline contains three integers n, q, c (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10) \u2014 the\nnumber of the stars, the number of the views and the maximum brightness of the\nstars. The next n lines contain the stars description. The i-th from these\nlines contains three integers xi, yi, si (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 100, 0 \u2264 si \u2264 c \u2264 10) \u2014\nthe coordinates of i-th star and its initial brightness. The next q lines\ncontain the views description. The i-th from these lines contains five\nintegers ti, x1i, y1i, x2i, y2i (0 \u2264 ti \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x1i < x2i \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 y1i <\ny2i \u2264 100) \u2014 the moment of the i-th view and the coordinates of the viewed\nrectangle. Output For each view print the total brightness of the viewed\nstars. Examples Input 2 3 3 1 1 1 3 2 0 2 1 1 2 2 0 2 1 4 5 5 1 1 5 5 Output 3\n0 3 Input 3 4 5 1 1 2 2 3 0 3 3 1 0 1 1 100 100 1 2 2 4 4 2 2 1 4 7 1 50 50 51\n51 Output 3 3 5 0 Note Let's consider the first example. At the first view,\nyou can see only the first star. At moment 2 its brightness is 3, so the\nanswer is 3. At the second view, you can see only the second star. At moment 0\nits brightness is 0, so the answer is 0. At the third view, you can see both\nstars. At moment 5 brightness of the first is 2, and brightness of the second\nis 1, so the answer is 3.\n\n",
