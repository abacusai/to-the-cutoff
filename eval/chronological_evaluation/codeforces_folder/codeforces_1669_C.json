        "description": "Given an array \n    a=[a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n]\n of \n    n\n positive integers, you\ncan do operations of two types on it: Add \n    1\n to every element with an odd\nindex. In other words change the array as follows: \n    a_1 := a_1 +1, a_3 :=\n    a_3 + 1, a_5 := a_5+1, \n    \u2026\n. Add \n    1\n to every element with an even\nindex. In other words change the array as follows: \n    a_2 := a_2 +1, a_4 :=\n    a_4 + 1, a_6 := a_6+1, \n    \u2026\n.Determine if after any number of operations\nit is possible to make the final array contain only even numbers or only odd\nnumbers. In other words, determine if you can make all elements of the array\nhave the same parity after any number of operations. Note that you can do\noperations of both types any number of times (even none). Operations of\ndifferent types can be performed a different number of times. Input The first\nline contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line of each test\ncase contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the elements of the array. Note that after the performed\noperations the elements in the array can become greater than \n    10^3\n.\nOutput Output \n    t\n lines, each of which contains the answer to the\ncorresponding test case. As an answer, output \"YES\" if after any number of\noperations it is possible to make the final array contain only even numbers or\nonly odd numbers, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case\n(for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as\na positive answer). Example Input 4 3 1 2 1 4 2 2 2 3 4 2 2 2 2 5 1000 1 1000\n1 1000 Output YES NO YES YES Note For the first test case, we can increment\nthe elements with an even index, obtaining the array \n    [1, 3, 1]\n, which\ncontains only odd numbers, so the answer is \"YES\". For the second test case,\nwe can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to\nmake all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\". For the third\ntest case, all elements already have the same parity so the answer is \"YES\".\nFor the fourth test case, we can perform one operation and increase all\nelements at odd positions by \n    1\n, thus obtaining the array \n    [1001, 1,\n    1001, 1, 1001]\n, and all elements become odd so the answer is \"YES\".\n\n",
