        "description": "Tonight is brain dinner night and all zombies will gather together to scarf\ndown some delicious brains. The artful Heidi plans to crash the party,\nincognito, disguised as one of them. Her objective is to get away with at\nleast one brain, so she can analyze the zombies' mindset back home and gain a\nstrategic advantage. They will be N guests tonight: N - 1 real zombies and a\nfake one, our Heidi. The living-dead love hierarchies as much as they love\nbrains: each one has a unique rank in the range 1 to N - 1, and Heidi, who\nstill appears slightly different from the others, is attributed the highest\nrank, N. Tonight there will be a chest with brains on display and every\nattendee sees how many there are. These will then be split among the attendees\naccording to the following procedure: The zombie of the highest rank makes a\nsuggestion on who gets how many brains (every brain is an indivisible entity).\nA vote follows. If at least half of the attendees accept the offer, the brains\nare shared in the suggested way and the feast begins. But if majority is not\nreached, then the highest-ranked zombie is killed, and the next zombie in\nhierarchy has to make a suggestion. If he is killed too, then the third\nhighest-ranked makes one, etc. (It's enough to have exactly half of the votes\n\u2013 in case of a tie, the vote of the highest-ranked alive zombie counts twice,\nand he will of course vote in favor of his own suggestion in order to stay\nalive.) You should know that zombies are very greedy and sly, and they know\nthis too \u2013 basically all zombie brains are alike. Consequently, a zombie will\nnever accept an offer which is suboptimal for him. That is, if an offer is not\nstrictly better than a potential later offer, he will vote against it. And\nmake no mistake: while zombies may normally seem rather dull, tonight their\nintellects are perfect. Each zombie's priorities for tonight are, in\ndescending order: survive the event (they experienced death already once and\nknow it is no fun), get as many brains as possible. Heidi goes first and must\nmake an offer which at least half of the attendees will accept, and which\nallocates at least one brain for Heidi herself. What is the smallest number of\nbrains that have to be in the chest for this to be possible? Input The only\nline of input contains one integer: N, the number of attendees (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^9).\nOutput Output one integer: the smallest number of brains in the chest which\nallows Heidi to take one brain home. Examples Input 1 Output 1 Input 4 Output\n2 Note\n\n",
