        "description": "Mikhail walks on a Cartesian plane. He starts at the point \n    (0, 0)\n, and\nin one move he can go to any of eight adjacent points. For example, if Mikhail\nis currently at the point \n    (0, 0)\n, he can go to any of the following\npoints in one move: \n    (1, 0)\n; \n    (1, 1)\n; \n    (0, 1)\n; \n    (-1, 1)\n;\n\n    (-1, 0)\n; \n    (-1, -1)\n; \n    (0, -1)\n; \n    (1, -1)\n. If Mikhail goes\nfrom the point \n    (x1, y1)\n to the point \n    (x2, y2)\n in one move, and\n\n    x1 \n     x2\n and \n    y1 \n     y2\n, then such a move is called a diagonal\nmove. Mikhail has \n    q\n queries. For the \n    i\n-th query Mikhail's target\nis to go to the point \n    (n_i, m_i)\n from the point \n    (0, 0)\n in exactly\n\n    k_i\n moves. Among all possible movements he want to choose one with the\nmaximum number of diagonal moves. Your task is to find the maximum number of\ndiagonal moves or find that it is impossible to go from the point \n    (0, 0)\n\nto the point \n    (n_i, m_i)\n in \n    k_i\n moves. Note that Mikhail can visit\nany point any number of times (even the destination point!). Input The first\nline of the input contains one integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014\nthe number of queries. Then \n    q\n lines follow. The \n    i\n-th of these\n\n    q\n lines contains three integers \n    n_i\n, \n    m_i\n and \n    k_i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n_i, m_i, k_i \n    \u2264 10^18\n) \u2014 \n    x\n-coordinate of the destination\npoint of the query, \n    y\n-coordinate of the destination point of the query\nand the number of moves in the query, correspondingly. Output Print \n    q\n\nintegers. The \n    i\n-th integer should be equal to -1 if Mikhail cannot go\nfrom the point \n    (0, 0)\n to the point \n    (n_i, m_i)\n in exactly \n    k_i\n\nmoves described above. Otherwise the \n    i\n-th integer should be equal to the\nthe maximum number of diagonal moves among all possible movements. Example\nInput 3 2 2 3 4 3 7 10 1 9 Output 1 6 -1 Note One of the possible answers to\nthe first test case: \n    (0, 0) \n    \u2192 (1, 0) \n    \u2192 (1, 1) \n    \u2192 (2, 2)\n. One\nof the possible answers to the second test case: \n    (0, 0) \n    \u2192 (0, 1) \n    \u2192\n    (1, 2) \n    \u2192 (0, 3) \n    \u2192 (1, 4) \n    \u2192 (2, 3) \n    \u2192 (3, 2) \n    \u2192 (4, 3)\n. In\nthe third test case Mikhail cannot reach the point \n    (10, 1)\n in 9 moves.\n\n",
