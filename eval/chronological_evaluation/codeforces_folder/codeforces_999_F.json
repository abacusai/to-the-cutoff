        "description": "There are \n    n\n players sitting at the card table. Each player has a\nfavorite number. The favorite number of the \n    j\n-th player is \n    f_j\n.\nThere are \n    k \n    \u00b7 n\n cards on the table. Each card contains a single\ninteger: the \n    i\n-th card contains number \n    c_i\n. Also, you are given a\nsequence \n    h_1, h_2, \n    \u2026, h_k\n. Its meaning will be explained below.\nThe players have to distribute all the cards in such a way that each of them\nwill hold exactly \n    k\n cards. After all the cards are distributed, each\nplayer counts the number of cards he has that contains his favorite number.\nThe joy level of a player equals \n    h_t\n if the player holds \n    t\n cards\ncontaining his favorite number. If a player gets no cards with his favorite\nnumber (i.e., \n    t=0\n), his joy level is \n    0\n. Print the maximum possible\ntotal joy levels of the players after the cards are distributed. Note that the\nsequence \n    h_1, \n    \u2026, h_k\n is the same for all the players. Input The\nfirst line of input contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 500, 1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10\n) \u2014 the number of players and the number of\ncards each player will get. The second line contains \n    k \n    \u00b7 n\n\nintegers \n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_k \n    \u00b7 n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the numbers written on the cards. The third line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    f_1, f_2, \n    \u2026, f_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 f_j \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nfavorite numbers of the players. The fourth line contains \n    k\n integers\n\n    h_1, h_2, \n    \u2026, h_k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 h_t \n    \u2264 10^5\n), where \n    h_t\n\nis the joy level of a player if he gets exactly \n    t\n cards with his\nfavorite number written on them. It is guaranteed that the condition \n    h_t -\n    1 < h_t\n holds for each \n    t \n    \u2208 [2..k]\n. Output Print one integer \u2014\nthe maximum possible total joy levels of the players among all possible card\ndistributions. Examples Input 4 3 1 3 2 8 5 5 8 2 2 8 5 2 1 2 2 5 2 6 7 Output\n21 Input 3 3 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 1 2 3 1 2 3 Output 0 Note In the first example,\none possible optimal card distribution is the following: Player \n    1\n gets\ncards with numbers \n    [1, 3, 8]\n; Player \n    2\n gets cards with numbers\n\n    [2, 2, 8]\n; Player \n    3\n gets cards with numbers \n    [2, 2, 8]\n;\nPlayer \n    4\n gets cards with numbers \n    [5, 5, 5]\n. Thus, the answer is\n\n    2 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 21\n. In the second example, no player can get a card with\nhis favorite number. Thus, the answer is \n    0\n.\n\n",
