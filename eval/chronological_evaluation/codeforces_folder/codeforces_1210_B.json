        "description": "Marcin is a coach in his university. There are \n    n\n students who want to\nattend a training camp. Marcin is a smart coach, so he wants to send only the\nstudents that can work calmly with each other. Let's focus on the students.\nThey are indexed with integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Each of them can be\ndescribed with two integers \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n; \n    b_i\n is equal to the\nskill level of the \n    i\n-th student (the higher, the better). Also, there\nare \n    60\n known algorithms, which are numbered with integers from \n    0\n\nto \n    59\n. If the \n    i\n-th student knows the \n    j\n-th algorithm, then\nthe \n    j\n-th bit (\n    2^j\n) is set in the binary representation of\n\n    a_i\n. Otherwise, this bit is not set. Student \n    x\n thinks that he is\nbetter than student \n    y\n if and only if \n    x\n knows some algorithm which\n\n    y\n doesn't know. Note that two students can think that they are better\nthan each other. A group of students can work together calmly if no student in\nthis group thinks that he is better than everyone else in this group. Marcin\nwants to send a group of at least two students which will work together calmly\nand will have the maximum possible sum of the skill levels. What is this sum?\nInput The first line contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    7000\n) \u2014 the number of students interested in the camp. The second line\ncontains \n    n\n integers. The \n    i\n-th of them is \n    a_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264\n    a_i < 2^60\n). The third line contains \n    n\n integers. The \n    i\n-th of\nthem is \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Output Output one integer\nwhich denotes the maximum sum of \n    b_i\n over the students in a group of\nstudents which can work together calmly. If no group of at least two students\ncan work together calmly, print 0. Examples Input 4 3 2 3 6 2 8 5 10 Output 15\nInput 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 Output 0 Input 1 0 1 Output 0 Note In the first sample\ntest, it's optimal to send the first, the second and the third student to the\ncamp. It's also possible to send only the first and the third student, but\nthey'd have a lower sum of \n    b_i\n. In the second test, in each group of at\nleast two students someone will always think that he is better than everyone\nelse in the subset.\n\n",
