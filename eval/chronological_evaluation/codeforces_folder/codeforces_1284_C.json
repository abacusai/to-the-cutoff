        "description": "Recall that the permutation is an array consisting of \n    n\n distinct\nintegers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n in arbitrary order. For example,\n\n    [2,3,1,5,4]\n is a permutation, but \n    [1,2,2]\n is not a permutation\n(\n    2\n appears twice in the array) and \n    [1,3,4]\n is also not a\npermutation (\n    n=3\n but there is \n    4\n in the array). A sequence \n    a\n\nis a subsegment of a sequence \n    b\n if \n    a\n can be obtained from \n    b\n\nby deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and\nseveral (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. We will denote the\nsubsegments as \n    [l, r]\n, where \n    l, r\n are two integers with \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n. This indicates the subsegment where \n    l-1\n elements\nfrom the beginning and \n    n-r\n elements from the end are deleted from the\nsequence. For a permutation \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n, we define a framed\nsegment as a subsegment \n    [l,r]\n where \n    max\n    \n    p_l, p_l+1, \n    \u2026,\n    p_r\n    \n     - \n    min\n    \n    p_l, p_l+1, \n    \u2026, p_r\n    \n     = r - l\n. For example,\nfor the permutation \n    (6, 7, 1, 8, 5, 3, 2, 4)\n some of its framed segments\nare: \n    [1, 2], [5, 8], [6, 7], [3, 3], [8, 8]\n. In particular, a subsegment\n\n    [i,i]\n is always a framed segments for any \n    i\n between \n    1\n and\n\n    n\n, inclusive. We define the happiness of a permutation \n    p\n as the\nnumber of pairs \n    (l, r)\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n, and\n\n    [l, r]\n is a framed segment. For example, the permutation \n    [3, 1, 2]\n\nhas happiness \n    5\n: all segments except \n    [1, 2]\n are framed segments.\nGiven integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n, Jongwon wants to compute the sum of\nhappiness for all permutations of length \n    n\n, modulo the prime number\n\n    m\n. Note that there exist \n    n!\n (factorial of \n    n\n) different\npermutations of length \n    n\n. Input The only line contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 250\n     000\n, \n    10^8 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n, \n    m\n is prime). Output Print \n    r\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 r < m\n), the\nsum of happiness for all permutations of length \n    n\n, modulo a prime number\n\n    m\n. Examples Input 1 993244853 Output 1 Input 2 993244853 Output 6 Input\n3 993244853 Output 32 Input 2019 993244853 Output 923958830 Input 2020\n437122297 Output 265955509 Note For sample input \n    n=3\n, let's consider all\npermutations of length \n    3\n: \n    [1, 2, 3]\n, all subsegments are framed\nsegment. Happiness is \n    6\n. \n    [1, 3, 2]\n, all subsegments except \n    [1,\n    2]\n are framed segment. Happiness is \n    5\n. \n    [2, 1, 3]\n, all\nsubsegments except \n    [2, 3]\n are framed segment. Happiness is \n    5\n.\n\n    [2, 3, 1]\n, all subsegments except \n    [2, 3]\n are framed segment.\nHappiness is \n    5\n. \n    [3, 1, 2]\n, all subsegments except \n    [1, 2]\n are\nframed segment. Happiness is \n    5\n. \n    [3, 2, 1]\n, all subsegments are\nframed segment. Happiness is \n    6\n. Thus, the sum of happiness is\n\n    6+5+5+5+5+6 = 32\n.\n\n",
