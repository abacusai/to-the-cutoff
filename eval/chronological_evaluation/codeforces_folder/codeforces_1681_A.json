        "description": "Alice and Bob play a game. Alice has \n    n\n cards, the \n    i\n-th of them has\nthe integer \n    a_i\n written on it. Bob has \n    m\n cards, the \n    j\n-th of\nthem has the integer \n    b_j\n written on it. On the first turn of the game,\nthe first player chooses one of his/her cards and puts it on the table (plays\nit). On the second turn, the second player chooses one of his/her cards such\nthat the integer on it is greater than the integer on the card played on the\nfirst turn, and plays it. On the third turn, the first player chooses one of\nhis/her cards such that the integer on it is greater than the integer on the\ncard played on the second turn, and plays it, and so on \u2014 the players take\nturns, and each player has to choose one of his/her cards with greater integer\nthan the card played by the other player on the last turn. If some player\ncannot make a turn, he/she loses. For example, if Alice has \n    4\n cards with\nnumbers \n    [10, 5, 3, 8]\n, and Bob has \n    3\n cards with numbers \n    [6, 11,\n    6]\n, the game may go as follows: Alice can choose any of her cards. She\nchooses the card with integer \n    5\n and plays it. Bob can choose any of his\ncards with number greater than \n    5\n. He chooses a card with integer \n    6\n\nand plays it. Alice can choose any of her cards with number greater than\n\n    6\n. She chooses the card with integer \n    10\n and plays it. Bob can\nchoose any of his cards with number greater than \n    10\n. He chooses a card\nwith integer \n    11\n and plays it. Alice can choose any of her cards with\nnumber greater than \n    11\n, but she has no such cards, so she loses. Both\nAlice and Bob play optimally (if a player is able to win the game no matter\nhow the other player plays, the former player will definitely win the game).\nYou have to answer two questions: who wins if Alice is the first player? who\nwins if Bob is the first player? Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test\ncase consists of four lines. The first line of a test case contains one\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the number of cards Alice has.\nThe second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the numbers written on the cards that Alice has. The\nthird line contains one integer \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of Bob's cards. The fourth line contains \n    m\n integers \n    b_1, b_2,\n    \n    \u2026, b_m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the numbers on Bob's cards.\nOutput For each test case, print two lines. The first line should be Alice if\nAlice wins when she is the first player; otherwise, the first line should be\nBob. The second line should contain the name of the winner if Bob is the first\nplayer, in the same format. Example Input 4 1 6 2 6 8 4 1 3 3 7 2 4 2 1 50 2\n25 50 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 5 15 Output Bob Bob Alice Alice Alice Bob Bob\nBob Note Let's consider the first test case of the example. Alice has one card\nwith integer \n    6\n, Bob has two cards with numbers \n    [6, 8]\n. If Alice is\nthe first player, she has to play the card with number \n    6\n. Bob then has\nto play the card with number \n    8\n. Alice has no cards left, so she loses.\nIf Bob is the first player, then no matter which of his cards he chooses on\nthe first turn, Alice won't be able to play her card on the second turn, so\nshe will lose.\n\n",
