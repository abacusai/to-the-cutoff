        "description": "You are given two permutations \n    a\n and \n    b\n, both consisting of \n    n\n\nelements. Permutation of \n    n\n elements is such a integer sequence that each\nvalue from \n    1\n to \n    n\n appears exactly once in it. You are asked to\nperform two types of queries with them: \n    1\u00a0l_a\u00a0r_a\u00a0l_b\u00a0r_b\n \u2014 calculate\nthe number of values which appear in both segment \n    [l_a; r_a]\n of\npositions in permutation \n    a\n and segment \n    [l_b; r_b]\n of positions in\npermutation \n    b\n; \n    2\u00a0x\u00a0y\n \u2014 swap values on positions \n    x\n and\n\n    y\n in permutation \n    b\n. Print the answer for each query of the first\ntype. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one query of the first type\nin the input. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n\n(\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of elements in both permutations and the number of queries. The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    a_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 permutation \n    a\n. It is guaranteed that each value from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n appears in \n    a\n exactly once. The third line contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\npermutation \n    b\n. It is guaranteed that each value from \n    1\n to \n    n\n\nappears in \n    b\n exactly once. Each of the next \n    m\n lines contains the\ndescription of a certain query. These are either: \n    1\u00a0l_a\u00a0r_a\u00a0l_b\u00a0r_b\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_a \n    \u2264 r_a \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 l_b \n    \u2264 r_b \n    \u2264 n\n);\n\n    2\u00a0x\u00a0y\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    x \n     y\n). Output Print the\nanswers for the queries of the first type, each answer in the new line \u2014 the\nnumber of values which appear in both segment \n    [l_a; r_a]\n of positions in\npermutation \n    a\n and segment \n    [l_b; r_b]\n of positions in permutation\n\n    b\n. Example Input 6 7 5 1 4 2 3 6 2 5 3 1 4 6 1 1 2 4 5 2 2 4 1 1 2 4 5 1\n2 3 3 5 1 1 6 1 2 2 4 1 1 4 4 1 3 Output 1 1 1 2 0 Note Consider the first\nquery of the first example. Values on positions \n    [1; 2]\n of \n    a\n are\n\n    [5, 1]\n and values on positions \n    [4; 5]\n of \n    b\n are \n    [1, 4]\n.\nOnly value \n    1\n appears in both segments. After the first swap (the second\nquery) permutation \n    b\n becomes \n    [2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6]\n. After the second\nswap (the sixth query) permutation \n    b\n becomes \n    [5, 1, 3, 2, 4, 6]\n.\n\n",
