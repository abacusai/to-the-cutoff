        "description": "\u00abBersoft\u00bb company is working on a new version of its most popular text editor\n\u2014 Bord 2010. Bord, like many other text editors, should be able to print out\nmultipage documents. A user keys a sequence of the document page numbers that\nhe wants to print out (separates them with a comma, without spaces). Your task\nis to write a part of the program, responsible for \u00abstandardization\u00bb of this\nsequence. Your program gets the sequence, keyed by the user, as input. The\nprogram should output this sequence in format l1-r1,l2-r2,...,lk-rk, where ri\n+ 1 < li + 1 for all i from 1 to k - 1, and li \u2264 ri. The new sequence should\ncontain all the page numbers, keyed by the user, and nothing else. If some\npage number appears in the input sequence several times, its appearances,\nstarting from the second one, should be ignored. If for some element i from\nthe new sequence li = ri, this element should be output as li, and not as \u00abli\n- li\u00bb. For example, sequence 1,2,3,1,1,2,6,6,2 should be output as 1-3,6.\nInput The only line contains the sequence, keyed by the user. The sequence\ncontains at least one and at most 100 positive integer numbers. It's\nguaranteed, that this sequence consists of positive integer numbers, not\nexceeding 1000, separated with a comma, doesn't contain any other characters,\napart from digits and commas, can't end with a comma, and the numbers don't\ncontain leading zeroes. Also it doesn't start with a comma or contain more\nthan one comma in a row. Output Output the sequence in the required format.\nExamples Input 1,2,3,1,1,2,6,6,2 Output 1-3,6 Input 3,2,1 Output 1-3 Input\n30,20,10 Output 10,20,30\n\n",
