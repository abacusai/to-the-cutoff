        "description": "The famous store \"Second Food\" sells groceries only two days a month. And the\nprices in each of days differ. You wanted to buy \n    n\n kilos of potatoes for\na month. You know that on the first day of the month \n    1\n kilo of potatoes\ncosts \n    a\n coins, and on the second day \n    b\n coins. In \"Second Food\" you\ncan buy any integer kilograms of potatoes. Fortunately, \"Second Food\" has\nannounced a promotion for potatoes, which is valid only on the first day of\nthe month \u2014 for each \n    m\n kilos of potatoes you buy, you get \n    1\n kilo\nas a gift! In other words, you can get \n    m + 1\n kilograms by paying for\n\n    m\n kilograms. Find the minimum number of coins that you have to spend to\nbuy at least \n    n\n kilos of potatoes. Input Each test contains multiple test\ncases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of\neach test case contains two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 a, b\n    \n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 the prices of \n    1\n kilo of potatoes on the first and\nsecond days, respectively. The second line contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 the required amount of potatoes to\nbuy and the amount of potatoes to use the promotion. Output For each test case\nprint one integer \u2014 the minimum number of coins that you have to pay to buy at\nleast \n    n\n kilos of potatoes. Example Input 5 5 4 3 1 5 4 3 2 3 4 3 5 20 15\n10 2 1000000000 900000000 1000000000 8 Output 9 10 9 135 888888888900000000\nNote In the first test case, on the first day you buy \n    1\n kilo and get\n\n    1\n more for a promotion. On the second day, you can buy \n    1\n kilo of\npotatoes. Thus, you will spend \n    5+4=9\n coins in total. In the second test\ncase, on the first day you buy \n    2\n kilo and get another \n    1\n more for a\npromotion. This way you will spend \n    2 \n    \u00b7 5 = 10\n coins.\n\n",
