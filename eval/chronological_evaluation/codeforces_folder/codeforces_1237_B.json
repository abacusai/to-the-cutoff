        "description": "Consider a tunnel on a one-way road. During a particular day, \n    n\n cars\nnumbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n entered and exited the tunnel exactly once.\nAll the cars passed through the tunnel at constant speeds. A traffic\nenforcement camera is mounted at the tunnel entrance. Another traffic\nenforcement camera is mounted at the tunnel exit. Perfectly balanced. Thanks\nto the cameras, the order in which the cars entered and exited the tunnel is\nknown. No two cars entered or exited at the same time. Traffic regulations\nprohibit overtaking inside the tunnel. If car \n    i\n overtakes any other car\n\n    j\n inside the tunnel, car \n    i\n must be fined. However, each car can be\nfined at most once. Formally, let's say that car \n    i\n definitely overtook\ncar \n    j\n if car \n    i\n entered the tunnel later than car \n    j\n and\nexited the tunnel earlier than car \n    j\n. Then, car \n    i\n must be fined if\nand only if it definitely overtook at least one other car. Find the number of\ncars that must be fined. Input The first line contains a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n), denoting the number of cars. The second\nline contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 n\n), denoting the ids of cars in order of entering the tunnel. All\n\n    a_i\n are pairwise distinct. The third line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 n\n), denoting the ids of\ncars in order of exiting the tunnel. All \n    b_i\n are pairwise distinct.\nOutput Output the number of cars to be fined. Examples Input 5 3 5 2 1 4 4 3 2\n5 1 Output 2 Input 7 5 2 3 6 7 1 4 2 3 6 7 1 4 5 Output 6 Input 2 1 2 1 2\nOutput 0 Note The first example is depicted below: Car \n    2\n definitely\novertook car \n    5\n, while car \n    4\n definitely overtook cars \n    1\n,\n\n    2\n, \n    3\n and \n    5\n. Cars \n    2\n and \n    4\n must be fined. In the\nsecond example car \n    5\n was definitely overtaken by all other cars. In the\nthird example no car must be fined.\n\n",
