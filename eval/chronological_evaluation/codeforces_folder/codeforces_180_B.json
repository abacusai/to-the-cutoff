        "description": "Vasya studies divisibility rules at school. Here are some of them:\nDivisibility by 2. A number is divisible by 2 if and only if its last digit is\ndivisible by 2 or in other words, is even. Divisibility by 3. A number is\ndivisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.\nDivisibility by 4. A number is divisible by 4 if and only if its last two\ndigits form a number that is divisible by 4. Divisibility by 5. A number is\ndivisible by 5 if and only if its last digit equals 5 or 0. Divisibility by 6.\nA number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by 2 and 3\nsimultaneously (that is, if the last digit is even and the sum of all digits\nis divisible by 3). Divisibility by 7. Vasya doesn't know such divisibility\nrule. Divisibility by 8. A number is divisible by 8 if and only if its last\nthree digits form a number that is divisible by 8. Divisibility by 9. A number\nis divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.\nDivisibility by 10. A number is divisible by 10 if and only if its last digit\nis a zero. Divisibility by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if and only if the\nsum of digits on its odd positions either equals to the sum of digits on the\neven positions, or they differ in a number that is divisible by 11.Vasya got\ninterested by the fact that some divisibility rules resemble each other. In\nfact, to check a number's divisibility by 2, 4, 5, 8 and 10 it is enough to\ncheck fulfiling some condition for one or several last digits. Vasya calls\nsuch rules the 2-type rules. If checking divisibility means finding a sum of\ndigits and checking whether the sum is divisible by the given number, then\nVasya calls this rule the 3-type rule (because it works for numbers 3 and 9).\nIf we need to find the difference between the sum of digits on odd and even\npositions and check whether the difference is divisible by the given divisor,\nthis rule is called the 11-type rule (it works for number 11). In some cases\nwe should divide the divisor into several factors and check whether rules of\ndifferent types (2-type, 3-type or 11-type) work there. For example, for\nnumber 6 we check 2-type and 3-type rules, for number 66 we check all three\ntypes. Such mixed divisibility rules are called 6-type rules. And finally,\nthere are some numbers for which no rule works: neither 2-type, nor 3-type,\nnor 11-type, nor 6-type. The least such number is number 7, so we'll say that\nin such cases the mysterious 7-type rule works, the one that Vasya hasn't\ndiscovered yet. Vasya's dream is finding divisibility rules for all possible\nnumbers. He isn't going to stop on the decimal numbers only. As there are\nquite many numbers, ha can't do it all by himself. Vasya asked you to write a\nprogram that determines the divisibility rule type in the b-based notation for\nthe given divisor d. Input The first input line contains two integers b and d\n(2 \u2264 b, d \u2264 100) \u2014 the notation system base and the divisor. Both numbers are\ngiven in the decimal notation. Output On the first output line print the type\nof the rule in the b-based notation system, where the divisor is d: \"2-type\",\n\"3-type\", \"11-type\", \"6-type\" or \"7-type\". If there are several such types,\nprint the one that goes earlier in the given sequence. If a number belongs to\nthe 2-type, print on the second line the least number of the last b-based\ndigits that we will need to use to check the divisibility. Examples Input 10\n10 Output 2-type 1 Input 2 3 Output 11-type Note The divisibility rule for\nnumber 3 in binary notation looks as follows: \"A number is divisible by 3 if\nand only if the sum of its digits that occupy the even places differs from the\nsum of digits that occupy the odd places, in a number that is divisible by 3\".\nThat's an 11-type rule. For example, 2110 = 101012. For it the sum of digits\non odd positions equals 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, an on even positions \u2014 0 + 0 = 0. The\nrule works and the number is divisible by 3. In some notations a number can\nfit into the 3-type rule and the 11-type rule. In this case the correct answer\nis \"3-type\".\n\n",
