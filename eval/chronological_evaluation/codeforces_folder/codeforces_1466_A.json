        "description": "Argus was charged with guarding Io, which is not an ordinary cow. Io is quite\nan explorer, and she wanders off rather frequently, making Argus' life\nstressful. So the cowherd decided to construct an enclosed pasture for Io.\nThere are \n    n\n trees growing along the river, where Argus tends Io. For\nthis problem, the river can be viewed as the \n    OX\n axis of the Cartesian\ncoordinate system, and the \n    n\n trees as points with the \n    y\n-coordinate\nequal \n    0\n. There is also another tree growing in the point \n    (0, 1)\n.\nArgus will tie a rope around three of the trees, creating a triangular\npasture. Its exact shape doesn't matter to Io, but its area is crucial to her.\nThere may be many ways for Argus to arrange the fence, but only the ones which\nresult in different areas of the pasture are interesting for Io. Calculate the\nnumber of different areas that her pasture may have. Note that the pasture\nmust have nonzero area. Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The\nfirst line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow, each one is described in\ntwo lines. In the first line of each test case there is a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) denoting the number of trees growing\nalong the river. Next line contains \n    n\n distinct integers \n    x_1 < x_2 <\n    \n    \u2026 < x_n - 1 < x_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 50\n), the\n\n    x\n-coordinates of trees growing along the river. Output In a single line\noutput an integer, the number of different nonzero areas that triangles with\ntrees as vertices may have. Example Input 8 4 1 2 4 5 3 1 3 5 3 2 6 8 2 1 2 1\n50 5 3 4 5 6 8 3 1 25 26 6 1 2 4 8 16 32 Output 4 2 3 1 0 5 3 15 Note In the\nfirst test case, we have \n    6\n non-degenerate triangles with the following\nareas: \n    0.5\n, \n    0.5\n, \n    1\n, \n    1.5\n, \n    1.5\n and \n    2\n. The\npasture can have \n    4\n different areas, and thus \n    4\n is the answer. In\nthe second test case, we have \n    3\n non-degenerate triangles with the\nfollowing areas: \n    1\n, \n    1\n and \n    2\n. The pasture can have \n    2\n\ndifferent areas, so \n    2\n is the answer. The following two drawings present\nthe situation in the second test case. The blue triangles in the first drawing\nhave area \n    1\n. The red triangle in the second drawing has area \n    2\n.\n\n",
