        "description": "There are \n    n + 1\n cities, numbered from \n    0\n to \n    n\n. \n    n\n roads\nconnect these cities, the \n    i\n-th road connects cities \n    i - 1\n and\n\n    i\n (\n    i \n    \u2208 [1, n]\n). Each road has a direction. The directions are\ngiven by a string of \n    n\n characters such that each character is either L\nor R. If the \n    i\n-th character is L, it means that the \n    i\n-th road\ninitially goes from the city \n    i\n to the city \n    i - 1\n; otherwise it\ngoes from the city \n    i - 1\n to the city \n    i\n. A traveler would like to\nvisit as many cities of this country as possible. Initially, they will choose\nsome city to start their journey from. Each day, the traveler must go from the\ncity where they currently are to a neighboring city using one of the roads,\nand they can go along a road only if it is directed in the same direction they\nare going; i. e., if a road is directed from city \n    i\n to the city \n    i +\n    1\n, it is possible to travel from \n    i\n to \n    i + 1\n, but not from \n    i\n    + 1\n to \n    i\n. After the traveler moves to a neighboring city, all roads\nchange their directions to the opposite ones. If the traveler cannot go from\ntheir current city to a neighboring city, their journey ends; it is also\npossible to end the journey whenever the traveler wants to. The goal of the\ntraveler is to visit as many different cities as possible (they can visit a\ncity multiple times, but only the first visit is counted). For each city\n\n    i\n, calculate the maximum number of different cities the traveler can\nvisit during exactly one journey if they start in the city \n    i\n. Input The\nfirst line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The\nsecond line contains the string \n    s\n consisting of exactly \n    n\n\ncharacters, each character is either L or R. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case, print \n    n + 1\n integers. The \n    i\n-th integer should be\nequal to the maximum number of different cities the traveler can visit during\none journey if this journey starts in the \n    i\n-th city. Example Input 2 6\nLRRRLL 3 LRL Output 1 3 2 3 1 3 2 1 4 1 4\n\n",
