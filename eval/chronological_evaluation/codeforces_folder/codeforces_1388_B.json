        "description": "Captain Flint and his crew keep heading to a savage shore of Byteland for\nseveral months already, drinking rum and telling stories. In such moments\nuncle Bogdan often remembers his nephew Denis. Today, he has told a story\nabout how Denis helped him to come up with an interesting problem and asked\nthe crew to solve it. In the beginning, uncle Bogdan wrote on a board a\npositive integer \n    x\n consisting of \n    n\n digits. After that, he wiped\nout \n    x\n and wrote integer \n    k\n instead, which was the concatenation of\nbinary representations of digits \n    x\n consists of (without leading zeroes).\nFor example, let \n    x = 729\n, then \n    k = 111101001\n (since \n    7 = 111\n,\n\n    2 = 10\n, \n    9 = 1001\n). After some time, uncle Bogdan understood that\nhe doesn't know what to do with \n    k\n and asked Denis to help. Denis decided\nto wipe last \n    n\n digits of \n    k\n and named the new number as \n    r\n. As\na result, Denis proposed to find such integer \n    x\n of length \n    n\n that\n\n    r\n (as number) is maximum possible. If there are multiple valid \n    x\n\nthen Denis is interested in the minimum one. All crew members, including\ncaptain Flint himself, easily solved the task. All, except cabin boy Kostya,\nwho was too drunk to think straight. But what about you? Note: in this task,\nwe compare integers (\n    x\n or \n    k\n) as numbers (despite what\nrepresentations they are written in), so \n    729 < 1999\n or \n    111 < 1000\n.\nInput The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Next \n    t\n lines contain test cases \u2014\none per test case. The one and only line of each test case contains the single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the integer\n\n    x\n you need to find. It's guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n from all\ntest cases doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case,\nprint the minimum integer \n    x\n of length \n    n\n such that obtained by\nDenis number \n    r\n is maximum possible. Example Input 2 1 3 Output 8 998\nNote In the second test case (with \n    n = 3\n), if uncle Bogdan had \n    x =\n    998\n then \n    k = 100110011000\n. Denis (by wiping last \n    n = 3\n digits)\nwill obtain \n    r = 100110011\n. It can be proved that the \n    100110011\n is\nthe maximum possible \n    r\n Denis can obtain and \n    998\n is the minimum\n\n    x\n to obtain it.\n\n",
