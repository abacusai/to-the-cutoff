        "description": "The city of Fishtopia can be imagined as a grid of \n    4\n rows and an odd\nnumber of columns. It has two main villages; the first is located at the top-\nleft cell \n    (1,1)\n, people who stay there love fishing at the Tuna pond at\nthe bottom-right cell \n    (4, n)\n. The second village is located at \n    (4,\n    1)\n and its people love the Salmon pond at \n    (1, n)\n. The mayor of\nFishtopia wants to place \n    k\n hotels in the city, each one occupying one\ncell. To allow people to enter the city from anywhere, hotels should not be\nplaced on the border cells. A person can move from one cell to another if\nthose cells are not occupied by hotels and share a side. Can you help the\nmayor place the hotels in a way such that there are equal number of shortest\npaths from each village to its preferred pond? Input The first line of input\ncontain two integers, \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 99\n, \n    0\n    \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00d7(n-2)\n), \n    n\n is odd, the width of the city, and\nthe number of hotels to be placed, respectively. Output Print \"YES\", if it is\npossible to place all the hotels in a way that satisfies the problem\nstatement, otherwise print \"NO\". If it is possible, print an extra \n    4\n\nlines that describe the city, each line should have \n    n\n characters, each\nof which is \"#\" if that cell has a hotel on it, or \".\" if not. Examples Input\n7 2 Output YES ....... .#..... .#..... ....... Input 5 3 Output YES .....\n.###. ..... .....\n\n",
