        "description": "The rules of Sith Tournament are well known to everyone. n Sith take part in\nthe Tournament. The Tournament starts with the random choice of two Sith who\nwill fight in the first battle. As one of them loses, his place is taken by\nthe next randomly chosen Sith who didn't fight before. Does it need to be said\nthat each battle in the Sith Tournament ends with a death of one of opponents?\nThe Tournament ends when the only Sith remains alive. Jedi Ivan accidentally\nappeared in the list of the participants in the Sith Tournament. However, his\nskills in the Light Side of the Force are so strong so he can influence the\nchoice of participants either who start the Tournament or who take the loser's\nplace after each battle. Of course, he won't miss his chance to take advantage\nof it. Help him to calculate the probability of his victory. Input The first\nline contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 18) \u2014 the number of participants of\nthe Sith Tournament. Each of the next n lines contains n real numbers, which\nform a matrix pij (0 \u2264 pij \u2264 1). Each its element pij is the probability that\nthe i-th participant defeats the j-th in a duel. The elements on the main\ndiagonal pii are equal to zero. For all different i, j the equality pij + pji\n= 1 holds. All probabilities are given with no more than six decimal places.\nJedi Ivan is the number 1 in the list of the participants. Output Output a\nreal number \u2014 the probability that Jedi Ivan will stay alive after the\nTournament. Absolute or relative error of the answer must not exceed 10^-6.\nExamples Input 3 0.0 0.5 0.8 0.5 0.0 0.4 0.2 0.6 0.0 Output 0.680000000000000\n\n",
