        "description": "You are given a grid with \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n columns. Rows and columns\nare numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, and from \n    1\n to \n    m\n. The\nintersection of the \n    a\n-th row and \n    b\n-th column is denoted by \n    (a,\n    b)\n. Initially, you are standing in the top left corner \n    (1, 1)\n. Your\ngoal is to reach the bottom right corner \n    (n, m)\n. You can move in four\ndirections from \n    (a, b)\n: up to \n    (a-1, b)\n, down to \n    (a+1, b)\n,\nleft to \n    (a, b-1)\n or right to \n    (a, b+1)\n. You cannot move in the same\ndirection in two consecutive moves, and you cannot leave the grid. What is the\nminimum number of moves to reach \n    (n, m)\n? Input The input consists of\nmultiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of the test cases. The description of the\ntest cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the size of the grid.\nOutput For each test case, print a single integer: \n    -1\n if it is\nimpossible to reach \n    (n, m)\n under the given conditions, otherwise the\nminimum number of moves. Example Input 6 1 1 2 1 1 3 4 2 4 6 10 5 Output 0 1\n-1 6 10 17 Note Test case \n    1\n: \n    n=1\n, \n    m=1\n, and initially you are\nstanding in \n    (1, 1)\n so \n    0\n move is required to reach \n    (n, m) = (1,\n    1)\n. Test case \n    2\n: you should go down to reach \n    (2, 1)\n. Test case\n\n    3\n: it is impossible to reach \n    (1, 3)\n without moving right two\nconsecutive times, or without leaving the grid. Test case \n    4\n: an optimal\nmoving sequence could be: \n    (1, 1) \n    \u2192 (1, 2) \n    \u2192 (2, 2) \n    \u2192 (2, 1)\n    \n    \u2192 (3, 1) \n    \u2192 (3, 2) \n    \u2192 (4, 2)\n. It can be proved that this is the\noptimal solution. So the answer is \n    6\n.\n\n",
