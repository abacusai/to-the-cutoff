        "description": "In the famous Oh-Suit-United tournament, two teams are playing against each\nother for the grand prize of precious pepper points. The first team consists\nof \n    n\n players, and the second team consists of \n    m\n players. Each\nplayer has a potential: the potential of the \n    i\n-th player in the first\nteam is \n    a_i\n, and the potential of the \n    i\n-th player in the second\nteam is \n    b_i\n. In the tournament, all players will be on the stage in some\norder. There will be a scoring device, initially assigned to an integer\n\n    k\n, which will be used to value the performance of all players. The\nscores for all players will be assigned in the order they appear on the stage.\nLet the potential of the current player be \n    x\n, and the potential of the\nprevious player be \n    y\n (\n    y\n equals \n    x\n for the first player).\nThen, \n    x-y\n is added to the value in the scoring device, Afterwards, if\nthe value in the scoring device becomes negative, the value will be reset to\n\n    0\n. Lastly, the player's score is assigned to the current value on the\nscoring device. The score of a team is the sum of the scores of all its\nmembers. As an insane fan of the first team, Nezzar desperately wants the\nbiggest win for the first team. He now wonders what is the maximum difference\nbetween scores of the first team and the second team. Formally, let the score\nof the first team be \n    score_f\n and the score of the second team be\n\n    score_s\n. Nezzar wants to find the maximum value of \n    score_f -\n    score_s\n over all possible orders of players on the stage. However,\nsituation often changes and there are \n    q\n events that will happen. There\nare three types of events: \n    1\n \n    pos\n \n    x\n \u2014 change \n    a_pos\n to\n\n    x\n; \n    2\n \n    pos\n \n    x\n \u2014 change \n    b_pos\n to \n    x\n; \n    3\n\n\n    x\n \u2014 tournament is held with \n    k = x\n and Nezzar wants you to compute\nthe maximum value of \n    score_f - score_s\n. Can you help Nezzar to answer\nthe queries of the third type? Input The first line contains three integers\n\n    n\n, \n    m\n, and \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n,m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5, 1 \n    \u2264 q\n    \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n). The third line contains\n\n    m\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_m\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n).\nThe following \n    q\n lines contain descriptions of events, described in the\nstatement, each in one of the three possible formats: \n    1\n \n    pos\n\n\n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 pos \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^6\n); \n    2\n\n\n    pos\n \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 pos \n    \u2264 m\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^6\n);\n\n    3\n \n    x\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^6\n). Output For each query of the\nthird type print the answer to this query.

It would be optimal to arrange players in such way (here their\npotentials are written): \n    7\n, \n    3\n, \n    5\n, \n    4\n,\n\n    6\n, \n    1\n, \n    2\n (underlined numbers are\npotentials of players that are from the first team). The individual scores of\nplayers, numbered in the order of their appearance, are: \n    max(5 + (7 -\n    7), 0) = 5\n for the \n    1\n-st player; \n    max(5 + (3 - 7),\n    0) = 1\n for the \n    2\n-nd player; \n    max(1 + (5 - 3), 0) = 3\n for the\n\n    3\n-rd player; \n    max(3 + (4 - 5), 0) = 2\n for the \n    4\n-th player;\n\n    max(2 + (6 - 4), 0) = 4\n for the \n    5\n-th player; \n    max(4 + (1 -\n    6), 0) = 0\n for the \n    6\n-th player; \n    max(0 + (2 - 1),\n    0) = 1\n for the \n    7\n-th player. So, \n    score_f = 5 + 0 + 1\n    = 6\n and \n    score_s = 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 10\n. The score difference is \n    6 -\n    10 = -4\n. It can be proven, that it is the maximum possible score\ndifference.\n\n",
