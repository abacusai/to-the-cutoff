        "description": "During the break the schoolchildren, boys and girls, formed a queue of n\npeople in the canteen. Initially the children stood in the order they entered\nthe canteen. However, after a while the boys started feeling awkward for\nstanding in front of the girls in the queue and they started letting the girls\nmove forward each second. Let's describe the process more precisely. Let's say\nthat the positions in the queue are sequentially numbered by integers from 1\nto n, at that the person in the position number 1 is served first. Then, if at\ntime x a boy stands on the i-th position and a girl stands on the (i + 1)-th\nposition, then at time x + 1 the i-th position will have a girl and the (i +\n1)-th position will have a boy. The time is given in seconds. You've got the\ninitial position of the children, at the initial moment of time. Determine the\nway the queue is going to look after t seconds. Input The first line contains\ntwo integers n and t (1 \u2264 n, t \u2264 50), which represent the number of children\nin the queue and the time after which the queue will transform into the\narrangement you need to find. The next line contains string s, which\nrepresents the schoolchildren's initial arrangement. If the i-th position in\nthe queue contains a boy, then the i-th character of string s equals \"B\",\notherwise the i-th character equals \"G\". Output Print string a, which\ndescribes the arrangement after t seconds. If the i-th position has a boy\nafter the needed time, then the i-th character a must equal \"B\", otherwise it\nmust equal \"G\". Examples Input 5 1 BGGBG Output GBGGB Input 5 2 BGGBG Output\nGGBGB Input 4 1 GGGB Output GGGB\n\n",
