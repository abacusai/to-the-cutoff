        "description": "You have \n    n\n stacks of blocks. The \n    i\n-th stack contains \n    h_i\n\nblocks and it's height is the number of blocks in it. In one move you can take\na block from the \n    i\n-th stack (if there is at least one block) and put it\nto the \n    i + 1\n-th stack. Can you make the sequence of heights strictly\nincreasing? Note that the number of stacks always remains \n    n\n: stacks\ndon't disappear when they have \n    0\n blocks. Input First line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4)\n \u2014 the number of test\ncases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n\n    (1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100)\n. The second line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    h_i\n \n    (0 \n    \u2264 h_i \n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 starting heights\nof the stacks. It's guaranteed that the sum of all \n    n\n does not exceed\n\n    10^4\n. Output For each test case output YES if you can make the sequence\nof heights strictly increasing and NO otherwise. You may print each letter in\nany case (for example, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will all be recognized as positive\nanswer). Example Input 6 2 1 2 2 1 0 3 4 4 4 2 0 0 3 0 1 0 4 1000000000\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 Output YES YES YES NO NO YES Note In the\nfirst test case there is no need to make any moves, the sequence of heights is\nalready increasing. In the second test case we need to move one block from the\nfirst stack to the second. Then the heights become \n    0\n \n    1\n. In the\nthird test case we could move one block from the first stack to the second and\nthen from the second to the third, which would make the heights \n    3\n\n\n    4\n \n    5\n. In the fourth test case we can't make a move, but the\nsequence is not increasing, so the answer is NO. In the fifth test case we can\nonly make one move (from the second to the third stack), which would make the\nheights \n    0\n \n    0\n \n    1\n. Both \n    0\n \n    1\n \n    0\n and \n    0\n\n\n    0\n \n    1\n are not increasing sequences, so the answer is NO.\n\n",
