        "description": "You are given an undirected graph consisting of \n    n\n vertices. A number is\nwritten on each vertex; the number on vertex \n    i\n is \n    a_i\n. Initially\nthere are no edges in the graph. You may add some edges to this graph, but you\nhave to pay for them. The cost of adding an edge between vertices \n    x\n and\n\n    y\n is \n    a_x + a_y\n coins. There are also \n    m\n special offers, each\nof them is denoted by three numbers \n    x\n, \n    y\n and \n    w\n, and means\nthat you can add an edge connecting vertices \n    x\n and \n    y\n and pay\n\n    w\n coins for it. You don't have to use special offers: if there is a pair\nof vertices \n    x\n and \n    y\n that has a special offer associated with it,\nyou still may connect these two vertices paying \n    a_x + a_y\n coins for it.\nWhat is the minimum number of coins you have to spend to make the graph\nconnected? Recall that a graph is connected if it's possible to get from any\nvertex to any other vertex using only the edges belonging to this graph. Input\nThe first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\nvertices in the graph and the number of special offers, respectively. The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    a_i \n    \u2264 10^12\n) \u2014 the numbers written on the vertices. Then \n    m\n\nlines follow, each containing three integers \n    x\n, \n    y\n and \n    w\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 w \n    \u2264 10^12\n, \n    x \n     y\n)\ndenoting a special offer: you may add an edge connecting vertex \n    x\n and\nvertex \n    y\n, and this edge will cost \n    w\n coins. Output Print one\ninteger \u2014 the minimum number of coins you have to pay to make the graph\nconnected. Examples Input 3 2 1 3 3 2 3 5 2 1 1 Output 5 Input 4 0 1 3 3 7\nOutput 16 Input 5 4 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 8 1 3 10 1 4 7 1 5 15 Output 18 Note In the\nfirst example it is possible to connect \n    1\n to \n    2\n using special offer\n\n    2\n, and then \n    1\n to \n    3\n without using any offers. In next two\nexamples the optimal answer may be achieved without using special offers.\n\n",
