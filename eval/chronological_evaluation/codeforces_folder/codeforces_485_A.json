        "description": "One industrial factory is reforming working plan. The director suggested to\nset a mythical detail production norm. If at the beginning of the day there\nwere x details in the factory storage, then by the end of the day the factory\nhas to produce (remainder after dividing x by m) more details. Unfortunately,\nno customer has ever bought any mythical detail, so all the details produced\nstay on the factory. The board of directors are worried that the production by\nthe given plan may eventually stop (that means that there will be \u0430 moment\nwhen the current number of details on the factory is divisible by m). Given\nthe number of details a on the first day and number m check if the production\nstops at some moment. Input The first line contains two integers a and m (1 \u2264\na, m \u2264 10^5). Output Print \"Yes\" (without quotes) if the production will\neventually stop, otherwise print \"No\". Examples Input 1 5 Output No Input 3 6\nOutput Yes\n\n",
