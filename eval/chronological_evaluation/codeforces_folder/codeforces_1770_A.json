        "description": "Kiyora has \n    n\n whiteboards numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Initially,\nthe \n    i\n-th whiteboard has the integer \n    a_i\n written on it. Koxia\nperforms \n    m\n operations. The \n    j\n-th operation is to choose one of the\nwhiteboards and change the integer written on it to \n    b_j\n. Find the\nmaximum possible sum of integers written on the whiteboards after performing\nall \n    m\n operations. Input Each test consists of multiple test cases. The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first\nline of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    n,m \n    \u2264 100\n). The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). The third line\nof each test case contains \n    m\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_m\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Output For each test case, output a single\ninteger \u2014 the maximum possible sum of integers written on whiteboards after\nperforming all \n    m\n operations. Example Input 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 1 2 3 4 5\n1 1 100 1 5 3 1 1 1 1 1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 Output 12 9 1\n3000000002 Note In the first test case, Koxia can perform the operations as\nfollows: Choose the \n    1\n-st whiteboard and rewrite the integer written on\nit to \n    b_1=4\n. Choose the \n    2\n-nd whiteboard and rewrite to\n\n    b_2=5\n. After performing all operations, the numbers on the three\nwhiteboards are \n    4\n, \n    5\n and \n    3\n respectively, and their sum is\n\n    12\n. It can be proven that this is the maximum possible sum achievable.\nIn the second test case, Koxia can perform the operations as follows: Choose\nthe \n    2\n-nd whiteboard and rewrite to \n    b_1=3\n. Choose the \n    1\n-st\nwhiteboard and rewrite to \n    b_2=4\n. Choose the \n    2\n-nd whiteboard and\nrewrite to \n    b_3=5\n. The sum is \n    4 + 5 = 9\n. It can be proven that this\nis the maximum possible sum achievable.\n\n",
