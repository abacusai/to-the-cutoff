        "description": "Arseniy is already grown-up and independent. His mother decided to leave him\nalone for m days and left on a vacation. She have prepared a lot of food, left\nsome money and washed all Arseniy's clothes. Ten minutes before her leave she\nrealized that it would be also useful to prepare instruction of which\nparticular clothes to wear on each of the days she will be absent. Arseniy's\nfamily is a bit weird so all the clothes is enumerated. For example, each of\nArseniy's n socks is assigned a unique integer from 1 to n. Thus, the only\nthing his mother had to do was to write down two integers li and ri for each\nof the days \u2014 the indices of socks to wear on the day i (obviously, li stands\nfor the left foot and ri for the right). Each sock is painted in one of k\ncolors. When mother already left Arseniy noticed that according to instruction\nhe would wear the socks of different colors on some days. Of course, that is a\nterrible mistake cause by a rush. Arseniy is a smart boy, and, by some magical\ncoincidence, he posses k jars with the paint \u2014 one for each of k colors.\nArseniy wants to repaint some of the socks in such a way, that for each of m\ndays he can follow the mother's instructions and wear the socks of the same\ncolor. As he is going to be very busy these days he will have no time to\nchange the colors of any socks so he has to finalize the colors now. The new\ncomputer game Bota-3 was just realised and Arseniy can't wait to play it. What\nis the minimum number of socks that need their color to be changed in order to\nmake it possible to follow mother's instructions and wear the socks of the\nsame color during each of m days. Input The first line of input contains three\nintegers n, m and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 200 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the\nnumber of socks, the number of days and the number of available colors\nrespectively. The second line contain n integers c1, c2, ..., cn (1 \u2264 ci \u2264 k)\n\u2014 current colors of Arseniy's socks. Each of the following m lines contains\ntwo integers li and ri (1 \u2264 li, ri \u2264 n, li \u2260 ri) \u2014 indices of socks which\nArseniy should wear during the i-th day. Output Print one integer \u2014 the\nminimum number of socks that should have their colors changed in order to be\nable to obey the instructions and not make people laugh from watching the\nsocks of different colors. Examples Input 3 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 2 3 Output 2 Input 3\n2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 Output 0 Note In the first sample, Arseniy can repaint the\nfirst and the third socks to the second color. In the second sample, there is\nno need to change any colors.\n\n",
