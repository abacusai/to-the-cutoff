        "name": "Fedya and Array",
        "description": "For his birthday recently Fedya was given an array \n    a\n of \n    n\n integers\narranged in a circle, For each pair of neighboring numbers (\n    a_1\n and\n\n    a_2\n, \n    a_2\n and \n    a_3\n, \n    \u2026\n, \n    a_n - 1\n and\n\n    a_n\n, \n    a_n\n and \n    a_1\n) the absolute difference between them is\nequal to \n    1\n. Let's call a local maximum an element, which is greater than\nboth of its neighboring elements. Also call a local minimum an element, which\nis less than both of its neighboring elements. Note, that elements \n    a_1\n\nand \n    a_n\n are neighboring elements. Unfortunately, Fedya lost an array,\nbut he remembered in it the sum of local maximums \n    x\n and the sum of local\nminimums \n    y\n. Given \n    x\n and \n    y\n, help Fedya find any matching\narray of minimum length. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The\nfirst line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n). Description of the test cases follows. Each line of each test case\ncontain two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n (\n    -10^9\n    \u2264 y < x \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) \u2014 the sum of local maximums and the sum of local minimums,\nrespectively. Output For each test case, in the first line print one integer\n\n    n\n \u2014 the minimum length of matching arrays. In the second line print\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    -10^9\n    \u2a7d a_i\n    \n    \u2a7d 10^9\n) \u2014 the array elements such that the the absolute\ndifference between each pair of neighboring is equal to \n    1\n. If there are\nmultiple solutions, print any of them. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Example\nInput 4 3 -2 4 -4 2 -1 5 -3 Output 10 0 1 2 1 0 -1 0 -1 0 1 16 -2 -1 -2 -1 0 1\n2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 6 1 0 -1 0 1 0 16 2 3 2 1 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 1 2 1 0 1 Note\nIn the first test case, the local maximums are the numbers at \n    3, 7\n and\n\n    10\n positions, and the local minimums are the numbers at \n    1, 6\n and\n\n    8\n positions. \n    x = a_3 + a_7 + a_10 = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3\n, \n    y = a_1 +\n    a_6 + a_8 = 0 + (-1) + (-1) = -2\n. In the second test case, the local\nmaximums are the numbers at \n    2\n and \n    10\n positions, and the local\nminimums are the numbers at \n    1\n and \n    3\n positions. \n    x = a_2 + a_10\n    = -1 + 5 = 4\n, \n    y = a_1 + a_3 = -2 + (-2) = -4\n. In the third test case,\nthe local maximums are the numbers at \n    1\n and \n    5\n positions, and the\nlocal minimums are the numbers at \n    3\n and \n    6\n positions.\n\n",
