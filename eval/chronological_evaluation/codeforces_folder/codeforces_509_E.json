        "description": "When Sasha was studying in the seventh grade, he started listening to music a\nlot. In order to evaluate which songs he likes more, he introduced the notion\nof the song's prettiness. The title of the song is a word consisting of\nuppercase Latin letters. The prettiness of the song is the prettiness of its\ntitle. Let's define the simple prettiness of a word as the ratio of the number\nof vowels in the word to the number of all letters in the word. Let's define\nthe prettiness of a word as the sum of simple prettiness of all the substrings\nof the word. More formally, let's define the function vowel(c) which is equal\nto 1, if c is a vowel, and to 0 otherwise. Let si be the i-th character of\nstring s, and si..j be the substring of word s, staring at the i-th character\nand ending at the j-th character (sisi + 1... sj, i \u2264 j). Then the simple\nprettiness of s is defined by the formula: The prettiness of s equals Find the\nprettiness of the given song title. We assume that the vowels are I, E, A, O,\nU, Y. Input The input contains a single string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 5\u00b710^5) \u2014 the\ntitle of the song. Output Print the prettiness of the song with the absolute\nor relative error of at most 10^-6. Examples Input IEAIAIO Output 28.0000000\nInput BYOB Output 5.8333333 Input YISVOWEL Output 17.0500000 Note In the first\nsample all letters are vowels. The simple prettiness of each substring is 1.\nThe word of length 7 has 28 substrings. So, the prettiness of the song equals\nto 28.\n\n",
