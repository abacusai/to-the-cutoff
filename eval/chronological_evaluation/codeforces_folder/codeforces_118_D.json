        "description": "Gaius Julius Caesar, a famous general, loved to line up his soldiers. Overall\nthe army had n1 footmen and n2 horsemen. Caesar thought that an arrangement is\nnot beautiful if somewhere in the line there are strictly more that k1 footmen\nstanding successively one after another, or there are strictly more than k2\nhorsemen standing successively one after another. Find the number of beautiful\narrangements of the soldiers. Note that all n1 + n2 warriors should be present\nat each arrangement. All footmen are considered indistinguishable among\nthemselves. Similarly, all horsemen are considered indistinguishable among\nthemselves. Input The only line contains four space-separated integers n1, n2,\nk1, k2 (1 \u2264 n1, n2 \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k1, k2 \u2264 10) which represent how many footmen\nand horsemen there are and the largest acceptable number of footmen and\nhorsemen standing in succession, correspondingly. Output Print the number of\nbeautiful arrangements of the army modulo 100000000 (10^8). That is, print the\nnumber of such ways to line up the soldiers, that no more than k1 footmen\nstand successively, and no more than k2 horsemen stand successively. Examples\nInput 2 1 1 10 Output 1 Input 2 3 1 2 Output 5 Input 2 4 1 1 Output 0 Note\nLet's mark a footman as 1, and a horseman as 2. In the first sample the only\nbeautiful line-up is: 121 In the second sample 5 beautiful line-ups exist:\n12122, 12212, 21212, 21221, 22121\n\n",
