        "description": "In Medieval times existed the tradition of burning witches at steaks together\nwith their pets, black cats. By the end of the 15-th century the population of\nblack cats ceased to exist. The difficulty of the situation led to creating\nthe EIC - the Emergency Inquisitory Commission. The resolution #666 says that\na white cat is considered black when and only when the perimeter of its black\nspots exceeds the acceptable norm. But what does the acceptable norm equal to?\nEvery inquisitor will choose it himself depending on the situation. And your\ntask is to find the perimeter of black spots on the cat's fur. The very same\nresolution says that the cat's fur is a white square with the length of 10^5.\nDuring the measurement of spots it is customary to put the lower left corner\nof the fur into the origin of axes (0;0) and the upper right one \u2014 to the\npoint with coordinates (10^5;10^5). The cats' spots are nondegenerate\ntriangles. The spots can intersect and overlap with each other, but it is\nguaranteed that each pair of the triangular spots' sides have no more than one\ncommon point. We'll regard the perimeter in this problem as the total length\nof the boarders where a cat's fur changes color. Input The first input line\ncontains a single integer n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 100). It is the number of spots on the\ncat's fur. The i-th of the last n lines contains 6 integers: x1i, y1i, x2i,\ny2i, x3i, y3i. They are the coordinates of the i-th triangular spot (0 < xji,\nyji < 10^5). Output Print a single number, the answer to the problem,\nperimeter of the union of triangles. Your answer should differ from the\ncorrect one in no more than 10^-6. Examples Input 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 Output\n3.4142135624 Input 3 3 3 10 3 3 10 1 1 9 4 5 6 2 2 11 7 6 11 Output\n37.7044021497\n\n",
