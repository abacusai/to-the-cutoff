        "description": "It's May in Flatland, and there are \n    m\n days in this month. Despite the\nfact that May Holidays are canceled long time ago, employees of some software\ncompany still have a habit of taking short or long vacations in May. Of\ncourse, not all managers of the company like this. There are \n    n\n employees\nin the company that form a tree-like structure of subordination: each employee\nhas a unique integer id \n    i\n between \n    1\n and \n    n\n, and each employee\nwith id \n    i\n (except the head manager whose id is 1) has exactly one direct\nmanager with id \n    p_i\n. The structure of subordination is not cyclic, i.e.\nif we start moving from any employee to his direct manager, then we will\neventually reach the head manager. We define that an employee \n    u\n is a\nsubordinate of an employee \n    v\n, if \n    v\n is a direct manager of \n    u\n,\nor the direct manager of \n    u\n is a subordinate of \n    v\n. Let \n    s_i\n be\nthe number of subordinates the \n    i\n-th employee has (for example, \n    s_1 =\n    n - 1\n, because all employees except himself are subordinates of the head\nmanager). Each employee \n    i\n has a bearing limit of \n    t_i\n, which is an\ninteger between \n    0\n and \n    s_i\n. It denotes the maximum number of the\nsubordinates of the \n    i\n-th employee being on vacation at the same moment\nthat he can bear. If at some moment strictly more than \n    t_i\n subordinates\nof the \n    i\n-th employee are on vacation, and the \n    i\n-th employee\nhimself is not on a vacation, he becomes displeased. In each of the \n    m\n\ndays of May exactly one event of the following two types happens: either one\nemployee leaves on a vacation at the beginning of the day, or one employee\nreturns from a vacation in the beginning of the day. You know the sequence of\nevents in the following \n    m\n days. Your task is to compute for each of the\n\n    m\n days the number of displeased employees on that day. Input The first\nline contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of employees in the company and the number of days in\nMay. The second line contains \n    n - 1\n integers \n    p_2, p_3, \n    \u2026,\n    p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n), denoting the direct managers of\nemployees. The third line contains \n    n\n integers \n    t_1, t_2, \n    \u2026,\n    t_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 t_i \n    \u2264 s_i\n), denoting the bearing limits of\nempoyees. The fourth line contains \n    m\n integers \n    q_1, q_2, \n    \u2026,\n    q_m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 |q_i| \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    q_i \n     0\n), denoting the\nevents. If \n    q_i\n is positive, then the employee with id \n    q_i\n leaves\nfor a vacation starting from this day, if \n    q_i\n is negative, then the\nemployee \n    -q_i\n returns from a vacation starting from this day. In the\nbeginning of May no employee is on vacation. It is guaranteed that if some\nemployee leaves for a vacation, he is not on a vacation at the moment and vice\nversa. Output Print a sequence of \n    m\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_m\n, where \n    a_i\n is the number of displeased employees on the\n\n    i\n-th day. Examples Input 7 8 4 5 1 1 5 5 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 2 6 3 7 -2 4 -3 1\nOutput 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 0 Input 5 6 1 2 3 4 4 0 0 1 0 1 5 2 3 -5 -1 Output 0 2 1\n0 0 0 Note In the first sample test after employee with id 2 leaves for a\nvacation at the first day, the head manager with id 1 becomes displeased as he\ndoes not want any of his subordinates to go for a vacation. At the fourth day\nemployee with id 5 becomes displeased as his last remaining employee with id 7\nleaves for a vacation. At the fifth day employee with id 2 returns from the\nvacation, but it does not affect the number of displeased employees as the\nemployees 5 and 1 are still displeased. At the sixth day employee with id 3\nreturns back from the vacation, preventing the employee with id 5 from being\ndispleased and at the last day the head manager with id 1 leaves for a\nvacation, leaving the company without the displeased people at all.\n\n",
