        "description": "So the Beautiful Regional Contest (BeRC) has come to an end! \n    n\n students\ntook part in the contest. The final standings are already known: the\nparticipant in the \n    i\n-th place solved \n    p_i\n problems. Since the\nparticipants are primarily sorted by the number of solved problems, then\n\n    p_1 \n    \u2265 p_2 \n    \u2265\n    \u2026\n    \u2265 p_n\n. Help the jury distribute the\ngold, silver and bronze medals. Let their numbers be \n    g\n, \n    s\n and\n\n    b\n, respectively. Here is a list of requirements from the rules, which\nall must be satisfied: for each of the three types of medals, at least one\nmedal must be awarded (that is, \n    g>0\n, \n    s>0\n and \n    b>0\n); the\nnumber of gold medals must be strictly less than the number of silver and the\nnumber of bronze (that is, \n    g<s\n and \n    g<b\n, but there are no\nrequirements between \n    s\n and \n    b\n); each gold medalist must solve\nstrictly more problems than any awarded with a silver medal; each silver\nmedalist must solve strictly more problems than any awarded a bronze medal;\neach bronze medalist must solve strictly more problems than any participant\nnot awarded a medal; the total number of medalists \n    g+s+b\n should not\nexceed half of all participants (for example, if \n    n=21\n, then you can\naward a maximum of \n    10\n participants, and if \n    n=26\n, then you can\naward a maximum of \n    13\n participants). The jury wants to reward with\nmedals the total maximal number participants (i.e. to maximize \n    g+s+b\n) so\nthat all of the items listed above are fulfilled. Help the jury find such a\nway to award medals. Input The first line of the input contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input.\nThen \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of a test case contains an\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 4\n    \u00b710^5\n) \u2014 the number of BeRC\nparticipants. The second line of a test case contains integers \n    p_1, p_2,\n    \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n), where \n    p_i\n is equal to\nthe number of problems solved by the \n    i\n-th participant from the final\nstandings. The values \n    p_i\n are sorted in non-increasing order, i.e.\n\n    p_1 \n    \u2265 p_2 \n    \u2265\n    \u2026\n    \u2265 p_n\n. The sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases in the input does not exceed \n    4\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output Print \n    t\n\nlines, the \n    j\n-th line should contain the answer to the \n    j\n-th test\ncase. The answer consists of three non-negative integers \n    g, s, b\n. Print\n\n    g=s=b=0\n if there is no way to reward participants with medals so that\nall requirements from the statement are satisfied at the same time. Otherwise,\nprint three positive numbers \n    g, s, b\n \u2014 the possible number of gold,\nsilver and bronze medals, respectively. The sum of \n    g+s+b\n should be the\nmaximum possible. If there are several answers, print any of them. Example\nInput 5 12 5 4 4 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 3 2 1 1 1000000 20 20 19 18 17 16 15 14\n13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 32 64 64 63 58 58 58 58 58 37 37 37 37 34 34 28\n28 28 28 28 28 24 24 19 17 17 17 17 16 16 16 16 11 Output 1 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n5 3 2 6 6 Note In the first test case, it is possible to reward \n    1\n gold,\n\n    2\n silver and \n    3\n bronze medals. In this case, the participant solved\n\n    5\n tasks will be rewarded with the gold medal, participants solved\n\n    4\n tasks will be rewarded with silver medals, participants solved \n    2\n\nor \n    3\n tasks will be rewarded with bronze medals. Participants solved\nexactly \n    1\n task won't be rewarded. It's easy to see, that in this case,\nall conditions are satisfied and it is possible to reward participants in this\nway. It is impossible to give more than \n    6\n medals because the number of\nmedals should not exceed half of the number of participants. The answer\n\n    1\n, \n    3\n, \n    2\n is also correct in this test case. In the second and\nthird test cases, it is impossible to reward medals, because at least one\nmedal of each type should be given, but the number of medals should not exceed\nhalf of the number of participants.\n\n",
