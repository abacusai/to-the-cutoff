Input The first line\ncontains two integers \n    n, m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of vertices and the number of edges. Each of the next \n    m\n lines\ncontain description of an edge \n    a_i\u00a0b_i\u00a0cost_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i\n    \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 cost_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Loops and multiple edges?\nHmm, why not? Output Print one integer \u2014 the answer to the problem. If there\nis no path, print \n    -1\n instead. Example Input 3 3 1 2 5 2 3 1 1 3 7 Output\n6\n\n",
