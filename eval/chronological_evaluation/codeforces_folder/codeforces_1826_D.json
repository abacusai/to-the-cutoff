        "description": "There is a street with \n    n\n sights, with sight number \n    i\n being \n    i\n\nmiles from the beginning of the street. Sight number \n    i\n has beauty\n\n    b_i\n. You want to start your morning jog \n    l\n miles and end it \n    r\n\nmiles from the beginning of the street. By the time you run, you will see\nsights you run by (including sights at \n    l\n and \n    r\n miles from the\nstart). You are interested in the \n    3\n most beautiful sights along your\njog, but every mile you run, you get more and more tired. So choose \n    l\n\nand \n    r\n, such that there are at least \n    3\n sights you run by, and the\nsum of beauties of the \n    3\n most beautiful sights minus the distance in\nmiles you have to run is maximized. More formally, choose \n    l\n and \n    r\n,\nsuch that \n    b_i_1 + b_i_2 + b_i_3 - (r - l)\n is maximum possible,\nwhere \n    i_1, i_2, i_3\n are the indices of the three maximum elements in\nrange \n    [l, r]\n. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of\neach test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n). The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^8\n) \u2014 beauties of sights \n    i\n miles\nfrom the beginning of the street. It's guaranteed that the sum of all \n    n\n\ndoes not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case output a single integer\nequal to the maximum value \n    b_i_1 + b_i_2 + b_i_3 - (r - l)\n for\nsome running range \n    [l, r]\n. Example Input 4 5 5 1 4 2 3 4 1 1 1 1 6 9 8 7\n6 5 4 7 100000000 1 100000000 1 100000000 1 100000000 Output 8 1 22 299999996\nNote In the first example, we can choose \n    l\n and \n    r\n to be \n    1\n and\n\n    5\n. So we visit all the sights and the three sights with the maximum\nbeauty are the sights with indices \n    1\n, \n    3\n, and \n    5\n with beauties\n\n    5\n, \n    4\n, and \n    3\n, respectively. So the total value is \n    5 + 4 +\n    3 - (5 - 1) = 8\n. In the second example, the range \n    [l, r]\n can be\n\n    [1, 3]\n or \n    [2, 4]\n, the total value is \n    1 + 1 + 1 - (3 - 1) =\n    1\n.\n\n",
