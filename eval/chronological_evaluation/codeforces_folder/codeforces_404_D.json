        "description": "Game \"Minesweeper 1D\" is played on a line of squares, the line's height is 1\nsquare, the line's width is n squares. Some of the squares contain bombs. If a\nsquare doesn't contain a bomb, then it contains a number from 0 to 2 \u2014 the\ntotal number of bombs in adjacent squares. For example, the correct field to\nplay looks like that: 001*2***101*. The cells that are marked with \"*\" contain\nbombs. Note that on the correct field the numbers represent the number of\nbombs in adjacent cells. For example, field 2* is not correct, because cell\nwith value 2 must have two adjacent cells with bombs. Valera wants to make a\ncorrect field to play \"Minesweeper 1D\". He has already painted a squared field\nwith width of n cells, put several bombs on the field and wrote numbers into\nsome cells. Now he wonders how many ways to fill the remaining cells with\nbombs and numbers are there if we should get a correct field in the end. Input\nThe first line contains sequence of characters without spaces s1s2... sn (1 \u2264\nn \u2264 10^6), containing only characters \"*\", \"?\" and digits \"0\", \"1\" or \"2\". If\ncharacter si equals \"*\", then the i-th cell of the field contains a bomb. If\ncharacter si equals \"?\", then Valera hasn't yet decided what to put in the\ni-th cell. Character si, that is equal to a digit, represents the digit\nwritten in the i-th square. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of ways\nValera can fill the empty cells and get a correct field. As the answer can be\nrather large, print it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Examples Input ?01???\nOutput 4 Input ? Output 2 Input **12 Output 0 Input 1 Output 0 Note In the\nfirst test sample you can get the following correct fields: 001**1, 001***,\n001*2*, 001*10.\n\n",
