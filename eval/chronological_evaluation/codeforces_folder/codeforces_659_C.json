        "description": "In Berland recently a new collection of toys went on sale. This collection\nconsists of 10^9 types of toys, numbered with integers from 1 to 10^9. A toy\nfrom the new collection of the i-th type costs i bourles. Tania has managed to\ncollect n different types of toys a1, a2, ..., an from the new collection.\nToday is Tanya's birthday, and her mother decided to spend no more than m\nbourles on the gift to the daughter. Tanya will choose several different types\nof toys from the new collection as a gift. Of course, she does not want to get\na type of toy which she already has. Tanya wants to have as many distinct\ntypes of toys in her collection as possible as the result. The new collection\nis too diverse, and Tanya is too little, so she asks you to help her in this.\nInput The first line contains two integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) and m (1 \u2264 m \u2264\n10^9) \u2014 the number of types of toys that Tanya already has and the number of\nbourles that her mom is willing to spend on buying new toys. The next line\ncontains n distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the types of\ntoys that Tanya already has. Output In the first line print a single integer k\n\u2014 the number of different types of toys that Tanya should choose so that the\nnumber of different types of toys in her collection is maximum possible. Of\ncourse, the total cost of the selected toys should not exceed m. In the second\nline print k distinct space-separated integers t1, t2, ..., tk (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 10^9)\n\u2014 the types of toys that Tanya should choose. If there are multiple answers,\nyou may print any of them. Values of ti can be printed in any order. Examples\nInput 3 7 1 3 4 Output 2 2 5 Input 4 14 4 6 12 8 Output 4 7 2 3 1 Note In the\nfirst sample mom should buy two toys: one toy of the 2-nd type and one toy of\nthe 5-th type. At any other purchase for 7 bourles (assuming that the toys of\ntypes 1, 3 and 4 have already been bought), it is impossible to buy two and\nmore toys.\n\n",
