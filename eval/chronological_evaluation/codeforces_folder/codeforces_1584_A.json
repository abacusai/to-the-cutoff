        "description": "Ivan decided to prepare for the test on solving integer equations. He noticed\nthat all tasks in the test have the following form: You are given two positive\nintegers \n    u\n and \n    v\n, find any pair of integers (not necessarily\npositive) \n    x\n, \n    y\n, such that: \n    \n\n    x/u + \n    y/v =\n    \n    x + y/u + v.\n\n    \n The solution \n    x = 0\n, \n    y = 0\n is\nforbidden, so you should find any solution with \n    (x, y) \n    \u2260 (0, 0)\n.\nPlease help Ivan to solve some equations of this form. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of test cases. The only\nline of each test case contains two integers \n    u\n and \n    v\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    u, v \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the parameters of the equation. Output For each test\ncase print two integers \n    x\n, \n    y\n \u2014 a possible solution to the\nequation. It should be satisfied that \n    -10^18\n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264\n    10^18\n and \n    (x, y) \n    \u2260 (0, 0)\n. We can show that an answer always\nexists. If there are multiple possible solutions you can print any. Example\nInput 4 1 1 2 3 3 5 6 9 Output -1 1 -4 9 -18 50 -4 9 Note In the first test\ncase: \n    -1/1 + \n    1/1 = 0 = \n    -1 + 1/1 + 1\n. In\nthe second test case: \n    -4/2 + \n    9/3 = 1 = \n    -4 +\n    9/2 + 3\n. In the third test case: \n    -18/3 + \n    50/5 = 4\n    = \n    -18 + 50/3 + 5\n. In the fourth test case: \n    -4/6 +\n    \n    9/9 = \n    1/3 = \n    -4 + 9/6 + 9\n.\n\n",
