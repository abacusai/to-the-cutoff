        "name": "Repainting Street",
        "description": "There is a street with \n    n\n houses in a line, numbered from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n. The house \n    i\n is initially painted in color \n    c_i\n. The street\nis considered beautiful if all houses are painted in the same color. Tom, the\npainter, is in charge of making the street beautiful. Tom's painting capacity\nis defined by an integer, let's call it \n    k\n. On one day, Tom can do the\nfollowing repainting process that consists of two steps: He chooses two\nintegers \n    l\n and \n    r\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n and\n\n    r - l + 1 = k\n. For each house \n    i\n such that \n    l \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    r\n, he can either repaint it with any color he wants, or ignore it and let\nit keep its current color. Note that in the same day Tom can use different\ncolors to repaint different houses. Tom wants to know the minimum number of\ndays needed to repaint the street so that it becomes beautiful. Input The\nfirst line of input contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n), the number of test cases. Description of test cases follows. In the\nfirst line of a test case description there are two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The second line contains \n    n\n\nspace-separated integers. The \n    i\n-th of these integers represents\n\n    c_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 100\n), the color which house \n    i\n is\ninitially painted in. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output Print \n    t\n lines, each with one\ninteger: the minimum number of days Tom needs to make the street beautiful for\neach test case. Example Input 3 10 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 7 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10\n3 1 3 3 3 3 1 2 1 3 3 Output 3 6 2 Note In the first test case Tom should\npaint houses 1 and 2 in the first day in color 2, houses 5 and 6 in the second\nday in color 2, and the last house in color 2 on the third day. In the second\ntest case Tom can, for example, spend 6 days to paint houses 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7\nin color 3. In the third test case Tom can paint the first house in the first\nday and houses 6, 7, and 8 in the second day in color 3.\n\n",
