        "description": "Ayoub thinks that he is a very smart person, so he created a function\n\n    f(s)\n, where \n    s\n is a binary string (a string which contains only\nsymbols \"0\" and \"1\"). The function \n    f(s)\n is equal to the number of\nsubstrings in the string \n    s\n that contains at least one symbol, that is\nequal to \"1\". More formally, \n    f(s)\n is equal to the number of pairs of\nintegers \n    (l, r)\n, such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 |s|\n (where\n\n    |s|\n is equal to the length of string \n    s\n), such that at least one of\nthe symbols \n    s_l, s_l+1, \n    \u2026, s_r\n is equal to \"1\". For example, if\n\n    s =\n\"01010\" then \n    f(s) = 12\n, because there are \n    12\n such pairs\n\n    (l, r)\n: \n    (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2,\n    5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5)\n. Ayoub also thinks that he is smarter\nthan Mahmoud so he gave him two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n and asked him\nthis problem. For all binary strings \n    s\n of length \n    n\n which contains\nexactly \n    m\n symbols equal to \"1\", find the maximum value of \n    f(s)\n.\nMahmoud couldn't solve the problem so he asked you for help. Can you help him?\nInput The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. The description of the test cases follows. The only line for each test\ncase contains two integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n,\n\n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the length of the string and the number of\nsymbols equal to \"1\" in it. Output For every test case print one integer\nnumber \u2014 the maximum value of \n    f(s)\n over all strings \n    s\n of length\n\n    n\n, which has exactly \n    m\n symbols, equal to \"1\". Example Input 5 3 1\n3 2 3 3 4 0 5 2 Output 4 5 6 0 12 Note In the first test case, there exists\nonly \n    3\n strings of length \n    3\n, which has exactly \n    1\n symbol,\nequal to \"1\". These strings are: \n    s_1 =\n\"100\", \n    s_2 =\n\"010\", \n    s_3\n    =\n\"001\". The values of \n    f\n for them are: \n    f(s_1) = 3, f(s_2) = 4,\n    f(s_3) = 3\n, so the maximum value is \n    4\n and the answer is \n    4\n. In\nthe second test case, the string \n    s\n with the maximum value is \"101\". In\nthe third test case, the string \n    s\n with the maximum value is \"111\". In\nthe fourth test case, the only string \n    s\n of length \n    4\n, which has\nexactly \n    0\n symbols, equal to \"1\" is \"0000\" and the value of \n    f\n for\nthat string is \n    0\n, so the answer is \n    0\n. In the fifth test case, the\nstring \n    s\n with the maximum value is \"01010\" and it is described as an\nexample in the problem statement.\n\n",
