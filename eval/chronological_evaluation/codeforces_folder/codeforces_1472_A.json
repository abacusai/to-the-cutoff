        "description": "For the New Year, Polycarp decided to send postcards to all his \n    n\n\nfriends. He wants to make postcards with his own hands. For this purpose, he\nhas a sheet of paper of size \n    w \n    \u00d7 h\n, which can be cut into pieces.\nPolycarp can cut any sheet of paper \n    w \n    \u00d7 h\n that he has in only two\ncases: If \n    w\n is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two\nsheets of size \n    w/2\n    \u00d7 h\n; If \n    h\n is even, then he can\ncut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size \n    w \n    \u00d7\n    h/2\n; If \n    w\n and \n    h\n are even at the same time, then\nPolycarp can cut the sheet according to any of the rules above. After cutting\na sheet of paper, the total number of sheets of paper is increased by \n    1\n.\nHelp Polycarp to find out if he can cut his sheet of size \n    w \n    \u00d7 h\n\nat into \n    n\n or more pieces, using only the rules described above. Input\nThe first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. Each test case consists\nof one line containing three integers \n    w\n, \n    h\n, \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 w,\n    h \n    \u2264 10^4, 1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the width and height of the sheet\nPolycarp has and the number of friends he needs to send a postcard to. Output\nFor each test case, output on a separate line: \"YES\", if it is possible to cut\na sheet of size \n    w \n    \u00d7 h\n into at least \n    n\n pieces; \"NO\"\notherwise. You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the strings\nyEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive). Example Input 5 2 2 3 3\n3 2 5 10 2 11 13 1 1 4 4 Output YES NO YES YES YES Note In the first test\ncase, you can first cut the \n    2 \n    \u00d7 2\n sheet into two \n    2 \n    \u00d7\n    1\n sheets, and then cut each of them into two more sheets. As a result, we\nget four sheets \n    1 \n    \u00d7 1\n. We can choose any three of them and send\nthem to our friends. In the second test case, a \n    3 \n    \u00d7 3\n sheet\ncannot be cut, so it is impossible to get two sheets. In the third test case,\nyou can cut a \n    5 \n    \u00d7 10\n sheet into two \n    5 \n    \u00d7 5\n sheets. In\nthe fourth test case, there is no need to cut the sheet, since we only need\none sheet. In the fifth test case, you can first cut the \n    1 \n    \u00d7 4\n\nsheet into two \n    1 \n    \u00d7 2\n sheets, and then cut each of them into two\nmore sheets. As a result, we get four sheets \n    1 \n    \u00d7 1\n.\n\n",
