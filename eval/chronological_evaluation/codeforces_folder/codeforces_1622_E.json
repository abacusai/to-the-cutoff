        "description": "Petya is a math teacher. \n    n\n of his students has written a test consisting\nof \n    m\n questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has\nanswered correctly and which he has not. If the student answers the \n    j\n-th\nquestion correctly, he gets \n    p_j\n points (otherwise, he gets \n    0\n\npoints). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way\nthat the array \n    p\n is a permutation of numbers from \n    1\n to \n    m\n.\nFor the \n    i\n-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get \n    x_i\n\npoints for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya\nbelieves that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to\n\n    \u2211\n    _i=1^n |x_i - r_i|\n, where \n    r_i\n is the number of\npoints that the \n    i\n-th student has got for the test. Your task is to help\nPetya find such a permutation \n    p\n for which the surprise value of the\nresults is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nInput The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains\ntwo integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of students and the number of questions, respectively.\nThe second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264\n    m(m+1)/2\n), where \n    x_i\n is the number of\npoints that the \n    i\n-th student expects to get. This is followed by \n    n\n\nlines, the \n    i\n-th line contains the string \n    s_i\n (\n    |s_i| = m; s_i,\n    j\n    \u2208\n    \n    0, 1\n), where \n    s_i, j\n is \n    1\n if the \n    i\n-th\nstudent has answered the \n    j\n-th question correctly, and \n    0\n otherwise.\nThe sum of \n    m\n for all test cases does not exceed \n    10^4\n. Output For\neach test case, print \n    m\n integers \u2014 a permutation \n    p\n for which the\nsurprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple\nanswers, print any of them.
