        "name": "Karen and Coffee",
        "description": "To stay woke and attentive during classes, Karen needs some coffee! Karen, a\ncoffee aficionado, wants to know the optimal temperature for brewing the\nperfect cup of coffee. Indeed, she has spent some time reading several recipe\nbooks, including the universally acclaimed \"The Art of the Covfefe\". She knows\nn coffee recipes. The i-th recipe suggests that coffee should be brewed\nbetween li and ri degrees, inclusive, to achieve the optimal taste. Karen\nthinks that a temperature is admissible if at least k recipes recommend it.\nKaren has a rather fickle mind, and so she asks q questions. In each question,\ngiven that she only wants to prepare coffee with a temperature between a and\nb, inclusive, can you tell her how many admissible integer temperatures fall\nwithin the range? Input The first line of input contains three integers, n, k\n(1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 200000), and q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 200000), the number of recipes, the\nminimum number of recipes a certain temperature must be recommended by to be\nadmissible, and the number of questions Karen has, respectively. The next n\nlines describe the recipes. Specifically, the i-th line among these contains\ntwo integers li and ri (1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 200000), describing that the i-th recipe\nsuggests that the coffee be brewed between li and ri degrees, inclusive. The\nnext q lines describe the questions. Each of these lines contains a and b, (1\n\u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 200000), describing that she wants to know the number of admissible\ninteger temperatures between a and b degrees, inclusive. Output For each\nquestion, output a single integer on a line by itself, the number of\nadmissible integer temperatures between a and b degrees, inclusive. Examples\nInput 3 2 4 91 94 92 97 97 99 92 94 93 97 95 96 90 100 Output 3 3 0 4 Input 2\n1 1 1 1 200000 200000 90 100 Output 0 Note In the first test case, Karen knows\n3 recipes. The first one recommends brewing the coffee between 91 and 94\ndegrees, inclusive. The second one recommends brewing the coffee between 92\nand 97 degrees, inclusive. The third one recommends brewing the coffee between\n97 and 99 degrees, inclusive. A temperature is admissible if at least 2\nrecipes recommend it. She asks 4 questions. In her first question, she wants\nto know the number of admissible integer temperatures between 92 and 94\ndegrees, inclusive. There are 3: 92, 93 and 94 degrees are all admissible. In\nher second question, she wants to know the number of admissible integer\ntemperatures between 93 and 97 degrees, inclusive. There are 3: 93, 94 and 97\ndegrees are all admissible. In her third question, she wants to know the\nnumber of admissible integer temperatures between 95 and 96 degrees,\ninclusive. There are none. In her final question, she wants to know the number\nof admissible integer temperatures between 90 and 100 degrees, inclusive.\nThere are 4: 92, 93, 94 and 97 degrees are all admissible. In the second test\ncase, Karen knows 2 recipes. The first one, \"wikiHow to make Cold Brew\nCoffee\", recommends brewing the coffee at exactly 1 degree. The second one,\n\"What good is coffee that isn't brewed at at least 36.3306 times the\ntemperature of the surface of the sun?\", recommends brewing the coffee at\nexactly 200000 degrees. A temperature is admissible if at least 1 recipe\nrecommends it. In her first and only question, she wants to know the number of\nadmissible integer temperatures that are actually reasonable. There are none.\n\n",
