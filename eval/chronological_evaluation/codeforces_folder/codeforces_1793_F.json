They invited \n    n\n people to the casting. The\ncasting will last \n    q\n days. On the \n    i\nth of the days, Kostya and\nZhenya want to find two people on the segment from \n    l_i\n to \n    r_i\n who\nare most suitable for their band. Since \"Day movers\" are doing a modern art,\nmusical skills are not important to them and they look only at other signs:\nthey want the height difference between two people to be as small as possible.\nHelp them, and for each day, find the minimum difference in the growth of\npeople from the casting on this segment! Input In the first line you are given\ntwo integers \n    n\n and \n    q\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5, 1\n    \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number of people who came to the casting and\nthe number of casting days. In the second line, you are given \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1, a_2, a_3, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the growth\nof each of the candidates. It is also guaranteed that all \n    a_i\n are\ndifferent. The following \n    q\n lines each contains two integers \n    l_i\n\nand \n    r_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i < r_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 a segment of people on the\n\n    i\nth day of casting. Output Output \n    q\n lines. In the \n    i\n-th line\nthere should be a minimum height difference between the two candidates on the\nsegment on the \n    i\n-th day of casting. Examples Input 3 3 1 3 2 1 2 2 3 1 3\nOutput 2 1 1 Input 5 3 4 1 5 3 2 1 2 3 4 2 4 Output 3 2 2 Input 7 4 2 6 1 7 3\n5 4 4 6 1 2 3 6 1 3 Output 2 4 2 1 Note In the first example, the minimum\ndifference on the segment \n    [1, 2]\n is \n    2\n, on the segment \n    [2, 3]\n\n\u2014 \n    1\n, on the segment \n    [1, 3]\n is also \n    1\n. In the third example,\nthe numbers with the minimum difference on the segment \n    [4, 6]\n are\n\n    3\n and \n    5\n (\n    5 - 3 = 2\n). On the segment \n    [1, 2]\n, the\nnumbers with the minimum difference are \n    2\n and \n    6\n (\n    6 - 2 = 4\n).\nOn the segment \n    [3, 6]\n, the numbers with the minimum difference are\n\n    1\n and \n    3\n (\n    3 - 1 = 2\n). On the segment \n    [1, 3]\n, the\nminimum difference is formed by the numbers \n    1\n and \n    2\n (\n    2 - 1 =\n    1\n).\n\n",
