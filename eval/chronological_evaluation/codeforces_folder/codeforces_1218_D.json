        "description": "In the galaxy far far away is the ancient interplanetary republic of\nBubbleland, consisting of \n    N\n planets. Between them, there are \n    M\n\nbidirectional wormholes, each connecting a pair of planets. Bubbleland is a\nvery centralized republic, having a capital planet Whiteplanet, from which any\nanother planet can be reached using these wormholes. It is also guaranteed\nthat no wormhole connects planet to itself and that no two different wormholes\nconnect same pair of planets. We call a path that begins at one planet, visits\nother planets and each of them at most once and returns to starting point a\ntour. Interplanetary Safety Regulations guarantee that each planet belongs to\nat most one tour and that there are at most \n    42\n tours. After many eons of\nusage, wormholes need to be repaired and each wormhole has the cost\n\n    W_i\n which needs to be payed for reparation. Unfortunately, the Senate\nof Bubbleland is short on budget. Therefore, they have decided only to fix as\nmany wormholes as they need in order to have all planets reachable from\ncapital and to pay as little money as they have to for this repair. However\nthe way in which the Senate calculates the cost is different. Cost of the set\nof reparations is binary xor of costs of each individual reparation, that is\nif reparations to be made have costs \n    A_1,A_2,...,A_k\n, the cost of\nentire set is \n    A_1\n    \u2295 A_2\n    \u2295 ... \n    \u2295 A_k\n. Now the\nSenate would like to know how much money do they have to pay and also the\nnumber of different ways to achieve that cost modulo \n    1000000007\n. Input\nFirst line of input contains two numbers \n    N (1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 100.000)\n,\nthe number of planets and \n    M (1 \n    \u2264 M \n    \u2264 100.041)\n, the number of\nwormholes. Following \n    M\n lines contain three numbers \n    U, V (1 \n    \u2264 U\n    \n    \u2260 V \n    \u2264 N)\n and \n    W (1 \n    \u2264 W \n    \u2264 100.000)\n, meaning that\nthere exists a wormhole connecting planets \n    U\n and \n    V\n, with repair\ncost of \n    W\n. Output Output two numbers, the smallest possible cost of\nentire reparation and the number of different valid reparations with that cost\nmodulo \n    1000000007\n. Example Input 6 6 4 1 5 5 2 1 6 3 2 1 2 6 1 3 3 2 3 4\nOutput 1 1 Note We can repair wormholes \n    1\n,\n    2\n,\n    3\n,\n    5\n and\n\n    6\n, paying \n    5 \n    \u2295 1\n    \u2295 2 \n    \u2295 3 \n    \u2295 4=1\n, one can\ncheck that this is the cheapest repair in which all of the planets are\nconnected and the only valid repair with that cost.\n\n",
