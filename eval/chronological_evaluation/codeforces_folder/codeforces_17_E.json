        "description": "In an English class Nick had nothing to do at all, and remembered about\nwonderful strings called palindromes. We should remind you that a string is\ncalled a palindrome if it can be read the same way both from left to right and\nfrom right to left. Here are examples of such strings: \u00abeye\u00bb, \u00abpop\u00bb, \u00ablevel\u00bb,\n\u00ababa\u00bb, \u00abdeed\u00bb, \u00abracecar\u00bb, \u00abrotor\u00bb, \u00abmadam\u00bb. Nick started to look carefully for\nall palindromes in the text that they were reading in the class. For each\noccurrence of each palindrome in the text he wrote a pair \u2014 the position of\nthe beginning and the position of the ending of this occurrence in the text.\nNick called each occurrence of each palindrome he found in the text\nsubpalindrome. When he found all the subpalindromes, he decided to find out\nhow many different pairs among these subpalindromes cross. Two subpalindromes\ncross if they cover common positions in the text. No palindrome can cross\nitself. Let's look at the actions, performed by Nick, by the example of text\n\u00abbabb\u00bb. At first he wrote out all subpalindromes: \u2022 \u00abb\u00bb \u2014 1..1 \u2022 \u00abbab\u00bb \u2014 1..3\n\u2022 \u00aba\u00bb \u2014 2..2 \u2022 \u00abb\u00bb \u2014 3..3 \u2022 \u00abbb\u00bb \u2014 3..4 \u2022 \u00abb\u00bb \u2014 4..4 Then Nick counted the\namount of different pairs among these subpalindromes that cross. These pairs\nwere six: 11\u0307..1 cross with 1..3 21\u0307..3 cross with 2..2 31\u0307..3 cross\nwith 3..3 41\u0307..3 cross with 3..4 53\u0307..3 cross with 3..4 63\u0307..4 cross\nwith 4..4 Since it's very exhausting to perform all the described actions\nmanually, Nick asked you to help him and write a program that can find out the\namount of different subpalindrome pairs that cross. Two subpalindrome pairs\nare regarded as different if one of the pairs contains a subpalindrome that\nthe other does not. Input The first input line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n2\u00b710^6) \u2014 length of the text. The following line contains n lower-case Latin\nletters (from a to z). Output In the only line output the amount of different\npairs of two subpalindromes that cross each other. Output the answer modulo\n51123987. Examples Input 4 babb Output 6 Input 2 aa Output 2\n\n",
