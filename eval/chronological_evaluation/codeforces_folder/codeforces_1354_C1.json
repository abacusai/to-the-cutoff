        "description": "The statement of this problem is the same as the statement of problem C2. The\nonly difference is that, in problem C1, \n    n\n is always even, and in C2,\n\n    n\n is always odd. You are given a regular polygon with \n    2 \n    \u00b7 n\n\nvertices (it's convex and has equal sides and equal angles) and all its sides\nhave length \n    1\n. Let's name it as \n    2n\n-gon. Your task is to find the\nsquare of the minimum size such that you can embed \n    2n\n-gon in the square.\nEmbedding \n    2n\n-gon in the square means that you need to place \n    2n\n-gon\nin the square in such way that each point which lies inside or on a border of\n\n    2n\n-gon should also lie inside or on a border of the square. You can\nrotate \n    2n\n-gon and/or the square. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Next\n\n    T\n lines contain descriptions of test cases \u2014 one per line. Each line\ncontains single even integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 200\n). Don't forget\nyou need to embed \n    2n\n-gon, not an \n    n\n-gon. Output Print \n    T\n real\nnumbers \u2014 one per test case. For each test case, print the minimum length of a\nside of the square \n    2n\n-gon can be embedded in. Your answer will be\nconsidered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed\n\n    10^-6\n. Example Input 3 2 4 200 Output 1.000000000 2.414213562\n127.321336469\n\n",
