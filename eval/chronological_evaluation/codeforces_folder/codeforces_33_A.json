        "description": "In one little known, but very beautiful country called Waterland, lives a\nlovely shark Valerie. Like all the sharks, she has several rows of teeth, and\nfeeds on crucians. One of Valerie's distinguishing features is that while\neating one crucian she uses only one row of her teeth, the rest of the teeth\nare \"relaxing\". For a long time our heroine had been searching the sea for\ncrucians, but a great misfortune happened. Her teeth started to ache, and she\nhad to see the local dentist, lobster Ashot. As a professional, Ashot quickly\nrelieved Valerie from her toothache. Moreover, he managed to determine the\ncause of Valerie's developing caries (for what he was later nicknamed Cap). It\nturned that Valerie eats too many crucians. To help Valerie avoid further\nreoccurrence of toothache, Ashot found for each Valerie's tooth its residual\nviability. Residual viability of a tooth is a value equal to the amount of\ncrucians that Valerie can eat with this tooth. Every time Valerie eats a\ncrucian, viability of all the teeth used for it will decrease by one. When the\nviability of at least one tooth becomes negative, the shark will have to see\nthe dentist again. Unhappy, Valerie came back home, where a portion of\ncrucians was waiting for her. For sure, the shark couldn't say no to her\nfavourite meal, but she had no desire to go back to the dentist. That's why\nshe decided to eat the maximum amount of crucians from the portion but so that\nthe viability of no tooth becomes negative. As Valerie is not good at\nmathematics, she asked you to help her to find out the total amount of\ncrucians that she can consume for dinner. We should remind you that while\neating one crucian Valerie uses exactly one row of teeth and the viability of\neach tooth from this row decreases by one. Input The first line contains three\nintegers n, m, k (1 \u2264 m \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^6) \u2014 total amount of Valerie's\nteeth, amount of tooth rows and amount of crucians in Valerie's portion for\ndinner. Then follow n lines, each containing two integers: r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 m) \u2014\nindex of the row, where belongs the corresponding tooth, and c (0 \u2264 c \u2264 10^6)\n\u2014 its residual viability. It's guaranteed that each tooth row has positive\namount of teeth. Output In the first line output the maximum amount of\ncrucians that Valerie can consume for dinner.
