        "description": "Valera runs a 24/7 fast food cafe. He magically learned that next day n people\nwill visit his cafe. For each person we know the arrival time: the i-th person\ncomes exactly at hi hours mi minutes. The cafe spends less than a minute to\nserve each client, but if a client comes in and sees that there is no free\ncash, than he doesn't want to wait and leaves the cafe immediately. Valera is\nvery greedy, so he wants to serve all n customers next day (and get more\nprofit). However, for that he needs to ensure that at each moment of time the\nnumber of working cashes is no less than the number of clients in the cafe.\nHelp Valera count the minimum number of cashes to work at his cafe next day,\nso that they can serve all visitors. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), that is the number of cafe visitors. Each of the\nfollowing n lines has two space-separated integers hi and mi (0 \u2264 hi \u2264 23; 0 \u2264\nmi \u2264 59), representing the time when the i-th person comes into the cafe. Note\nthat the time is given in the chronological order. All time is given within\none 24-hour period. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of\ncashes, needed to serve all clients next day. Examples Input 4 8 0 8 10 8 10 8\n45 Output 2 Input 3 0 12 10 11 22 22 Output 1 Note In the first sample it is\nnot enough one cash to serve all clients, because two visitors will come into\ncafe in 8:10. Therefore, if there will be one cash in cafe, then one customer\nwill be served by it, and another one will not wait and will go away. In the\nsecond sample all visitors will come in different times, so it will be enough\none cash.\n\n",
