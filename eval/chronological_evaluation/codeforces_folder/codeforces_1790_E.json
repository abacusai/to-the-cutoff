        "description": "Vlad found two positive numbers \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    a,b>0\n). He\ndiscovered that \n    a \n    \u2295 b = \n    a + b/2\n, where \n    \u2295\n\nmeans the bitwise exclusive OR , and division is performed without rounding..\nSince it is easier to remember one number than two, Vlad remembered only\n\n    a\n    \u2295 b\n, let's denote this number as \n    x\n. Help him find any\nsuitable \n    a\n and \n    b\n or tell him that they do not exist. Input The\nfirst line of the input data contains the single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test. Each test case is\ndescribed by a single integer \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 2^29\n) \u2014 the\nnumber that Vlad remembered. Output Output \n    t\n lines, each of which is the\nanswer to the corresponding test case. As the answer, output \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n (\n    0 < a,b \n    \u2264 2^32\n), such that \n    x = a \n    \u2295 b =\n    \n    a + b/2\n. If there are several answers, output any of them. If\nthere are no matching pairs, output -1. Example Input 6 2 5 10 6 18 36 Output\n3 1 -1 13 7 -1 25 11 50 22\n\n",
