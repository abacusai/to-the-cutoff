        "description": "Once upon a time, in the Land of the Shamans, everyone lived on the Sky-High\nBeanstalk. Each shaman had a unique identifying number \n    i\n between \n    0\n\nand \n    N-1\n, and an altitude value \n    H_i\n, representing how high he lived\nabove ground level. The distance between two altitudes is the absolute value\nof their difference. All shamans lived together in peace, until one of them\nstole the formula of the world-famous Potion of Great Power. To cover his/her\ntracks, the Thief has put a Curse on the land: most inhabitants could no\nlonger trust each other... Despite the very difficult circumstances, the Order\nof Good Investigators have gained the following information about the Curse:\nWhen the Curse first takes effect, everyone stops trusting each other. The\nCurse is unstable: at the end of each day (exactly at midnight), one pair of\nshamans will start or stop trusting each other. Unfortunately, each shaman\nwill only ever trust at most \n    D\n others at any given time. They have also\nreconstructed a log of who trusted whom: for each night they know which pair\nof shamans started/stopped trusting each other.They believe the Thief has\nwhispered the formula to an Evil Shaman. To avoid detection, both of them\nvisited the home of one of their (respective) trusted friends. During the\nvisit, the Thief whispered the formula to the Evil Shaman through the window.\n(Note: this trusted friend did not have to be home at the time. In fact, it's\neven possible that they visited each other's houses \u2013 shamans are weird.)\nFortunately, whispers only travel short distances, so the Order knows the two\ntrusted friends visited (by the Thief and the Evil Shaman) must live very\nclose to each other. They ask you to help with their investigation. They would\nlike to test their suspicions: what if the Thief was \n    x\n, the Evil Shaman\nwas \n    y\n, and the formula was whispered on day \n    v\n? What is the\nsmallest distance the whispered formula had to travel? That is, what is the\nminimum distance between the apartments of some shamans \n    x'\n and \n    y'\n\n(i.e. \n    min\n    (\n    |H_x' - H_y'\n    |\n    )\n), such\nthat \n    x'\n was a trusted friend of \n    x\n and \n    y'\n was a trusted\nfriend of \n    y\n on day \n    v\n? They will share all their information with\nyou, then ask you a number of questions. You need to answer each question\nimmediately, before receiving the next one. Interaction The interaction will\nbegin with a line containing \n    N\n, \n    D\n, \n    U\n and \n    Q\n \n    (2\n    \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 100000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 D \n    \u2264 500\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 U \n    \u2264\n    200000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 Q \n    \u2264 50000)\n \u2013 the number of shamans, the maximum\nnumber of trusted friends a shaman can have at any given point, the number of\ndays, and the number of questions. On the next line \n    N\n space separated\nintegers will follow, the \n    i\nth \n    (1\n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 N)\n of which being\n\n    H_i-1\n \n    (0\n    \u2264 H_i-1\n    \u2264 10^9)\n, the altitude of shaman\n\n    i-1\n. On the next \n    U\n lines there will be two integers each, on the\n\n    i\nth (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 U\n) \n    A_i\n and \n    B_i\n \n    (0 \n    \u2264\n    A_i, B_i < N\n and \n    A_i \n    \u2260 B_i)\n, which represents a pair of shamans\nwho started or stopped trusting each other at the end of day \n    i-1\n. That\nis, if \n    A_i\n and \n    B_i\n trusted each other on day \n    i-1\n, they did\nnot trust each other on day \n    i\n, or vice versa. Read all of these\nintegers. The interactor now will ask you \n    Q\n question, so the following\ninteraction should happen \n    Q\n times: Read \n    3\n integers describing the\ncurrent query: \n    x,y\n and \n    v\n (\n    x \n    \u2260 y\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 x,y < N\n\nand \n    0 \n    \u2264 v \n    \u2264 U\n), where \n    x\n is the suspected Thief, \n    y\n\nis the suspected Evil Shaman, and \n    v\n is the suspected day.. Then print\nthe answer to this query on a single line, i.e. you should print the minimum\ndistance the whispered formula had to travel from some trusted friend \n    x'\n\nof \n    x\n to a trusted friend \n    y'\n of \n    y\n. In case someone trusted\nboth \n    x\n and \n    y\n (i.e. \n    x'=y'\n), you should print \n    0\n. If\n\n    x\n or \n    y\n had no trusted friends, print \n    10^9\n. After printing\neach line do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise,\nyou will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: fflush(stdout) or\ncout.flush() in C++; System.out.flush() in Java; flush(output) in Pascal;\nstdout.flush() in Python; see documentation for other languages.
