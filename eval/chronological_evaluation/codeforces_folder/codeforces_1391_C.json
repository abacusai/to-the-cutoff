        "description": "A permutation of length \n    n\n is an array consisting of \n    n\n distinct\nintegers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n in arbitrary order. For example,\n\n    [2,3,1,5,4]\n is a permutation, but \n    [1,2,2]\n is not a permutation\n(\n    2\n appears twice in the array) and \n    [1,3,4]\n is also not a\npermutation (\n    n=3\n but there is \n    4\n in the array). Consider a\npermutation \n    p\n of length \n    n\n, we build a graph of size \n    n\n using\nit as follows: For every \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n, find the largest \n    j\n\nsuch that \n    1 \n    \u2264 j < i\n and \n    p_j > p_i\n, and add an undirected edge\nbetween node \n    i\n and node \n    j\n For every \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n,\nfind the smallest \n    j\n such that \n    i < j \n    \u2264 n\n and \n    p_j > p_i\n,\nand add an undirected edge between node \n    i\n and node \n    j\n In cases\nwhere no such \n    j\n exists, we make no edges. Also, note that we make edges\nbetween the corresponding indices, not the values at those indices. For\nclarity, consider as an example \n    n = 4\n, and \n    p = [3,1,4,2]\n; here,\nthe edges of the graph are \n    (1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(4,3)\n. A permutation\n\n    p\n is cyclic if the graph built using \n    p\n has at least one simple\ncycle. Given \n    n\n, find the number of cyclic permutations of length\n\n    n\n. Since the number may be very large, output it modulo \n    10^9+7\n.\nPlease refer to the Notes section for the formal definition of a simple cycle\nInput The first and only line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^6\n). Output Output a single integer \n    0 \n    \u2264 x < 10^9+7\n, the\nnumber of cyclic permutations of length \n    n\n modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Examples\nInput 4 Output 16 Input 583291 Output 135712853 Note There are \n    16\n cyclic\npermutations for \n    n = 4\n. \n    [4,2,1,3]\n is one such permutation, having\na cycle of length four: \n    4 \n    \u2192 3 \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 1\n    \n    \u2192 4\n. Nodes \n    v_1\n, \n    v_2\n, \n    \u2026\n, \n    v_k\n form\na simple cycle if the following conditions hold: \n    k \n    \u2265 3\n. \n    v_i\n    \n    \u2260 v_j\n for any pair of indices \n    i\n and \n    j\n. (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i < j\n    \n    \u2264 k\n) \n    v_i\n and \n    v_i+1\n share an edge for all \n    i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 i < k\n), and \n    v_1\n and \n    v_k\n share an edge.\n\n",
