        "description": "You are given two strings \n    s\n and \n    t\n, both of length \n    n\n. Each\ncharacter in both string is 'a', 'b' or 'c'. In one move, you can perform one\nof the following actions: choose an occurrence of \"ab\" in \n    s\n and replace\nit with \"ba\"; choose an occurrence of \"bc\" in \n    s\n and replace it with\n\"cb\". You are allowed to perform an arbitrary amount of moves (possibly,\nzero). Can you change string \n    s\n to make it equal to string \n    t\n? Input\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^4\n)\n\u2014 the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of strings \n    s\n\nand \n    t\n. The second line contains string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n. Each\ncharacter is 'a', 'b' or 'c'. The third line contains string \n    t\n of length\n\n    n\n. Each character is 'a', 'b' or 'c'. The sum of \n    n\n over all\ntestcases doesn't exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each testcase, print \"YES\" if\nyou can change string \n    s\n to make it equal to string \n    t\n by performing\nan arbitrary amount of moves (possibly, zero). Otherwise, print \"NO\". Example\nInput 5 3 cab cab 1 a b 6 abbabc bbaacb 10 bcaabababc cbbababaac 2 ba ab\nOutput YES NO YES YES NO\n\n",
