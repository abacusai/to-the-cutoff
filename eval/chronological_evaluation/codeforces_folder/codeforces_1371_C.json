        "description": "Anna is a girl so brave that she is loved by everyone in the city and citizens\nlove her cookies. She is planning to hold a party with cookies. Now she has\n\n    a\n vanilla cookies and \n    b\n chocolate cookies for the party. She\ninvited \n    n\n guests of the first type and \n    m\n guests of the second type\nto the party. They will come to the party in some order. After coming to the\nparty, each guest will choose the type of cookie (vanilla or chocolate) to\neat. There is a difference in the way how they choose that type: If there are\n\n    v\n vanilla cookies and \n    c\n chocolate cookies at the moment, when the\nguest comes, then if the guest of the first type: if \n    v>c\n the guest\nselects a vanilla cookie. Otherwise, the guest selects a chocolate cookie. if\nthe guest of the second type: if \n    v>c\n the guest selects a chocolate\ncookie. Otherwise, the guest selects a vanilla cookie. After that: If there is\nat least one cookie of the selected type, the guest eats one. Otherwise (there\nare no cookies of the selected type), the guest gets angry and returns to\nhome. Anna wants to know if there exists some order of guests, such that no\none guest gets angry. Your task is to answer her question. Input The input\nconsists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Next \n    t\n\nlines contain descriptions of test cases. For each test case, the only line\ncontains four integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    n\n, \n    m\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a,b,n,m\n    \n    \u2264 10^18, n+m \n    \u2260 0\n). Output For each test case, print the answer\nin one line. If there exists at least one valid order, print \"Yes\". Otherwise,\nprint \"No\". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). Example\nInput 6 2 2 1 2 0 100 0 1 12 13 25 1 27 83 14 25 0 0 1 0 1000000000000000000\n1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 Output Yes No No\nYes No Yes Note In the first test case, let's consider the order \n    1, 2,\n    2\n of types of guests. Then: The first guest eats a chocolate cookie.\nAfter that, there are \n    2\n vanilla cookies and \n    1\n chocolate cookie.\nThe second guest eats a chocolate cookie. After that, there are \n    2\n\nvanilla cookies and \n    0\n chocolate cookies. The last guest selects a\nchocolate cookie, but there are no chocolate cookies. So, the guest gets\nangry. So, this order can't be chosen by Anna. Let's consider the order\n\n    2, 2, 1\n of types of guests. Then: The first guest eats a\nvanilla cookie. After that, there is \n    1\n vanilla cookie and \n    2\n\nchocolate cookies. The second guest eats a vanilla cookie. After that, there\nare \n    0\n vanilla cookies and \n    2\n chocolate cookies. The last guest eats\na chocolate cookie. After that, there are \n    0\n vanilla cookies and \n    1\n\nchocolate cookie. So, the answer to this test case is \"Yes\". In the fifth test\ncase, it is illustrated, that the number of cookies (\n    a + b\n) can be equal\nto zero, but the number of guests (\n    n + m\n) can't be equal to zero. In the\nsixth test case, be careful about the overflow of \n    32\n-bit integer type.\n\n",
