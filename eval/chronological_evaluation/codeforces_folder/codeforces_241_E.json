        "description": "LiLand is a country, consisting of n cities. The cities are numbered from 1 to\nn. The country is well known because it has a very strange transportation\nsystem. There are many one-way flights that make it possible to travel between\nthe cities, but the flights are arranged in a way that once you leave a city\nyou will never be able to return to that city again. Previously each flight\ntook exactly one hour, but recently Lily has become the new manager of\ntransportation system and she wants to change the duration of some flights.\nSpecifically, she wants to change the duration of some flights to exactly 2\nhours in such a way that all trips from city 1 to city n take the same time\nregardless of their path. Your task is to help Lily to change the duration of\nflights. Input First line of the input contains two integer numbers n and m (2\n\u2264 n \u2264 1000; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 5000) specifying the number of cities and the number of\nflights. Each of the next m lines contains two integers ai and bi (1 \u2264 ai < bi\n\u2264 n) specifying a one-directional flight from city ai to city bi. It is\nguaranteed that there exists a way to travel from city number 1 to city number\nn using the given flights. It is guaranteed that there is no sequence of\nflights that forms a cyclical path and no two flights are between the same\npair of cities. Output If it is impossible for Lily to do her task, print \"No\"\n(without quotes) on the only line of the output. Otherwise print \"Yes\"\n(without quotes) on the first line of output, then print an integer ansi (1 \u2264\nansi \u2264 2) to each of the next m lines being the duration of flights in new\ntransportation system. You should print these numbers in the order that\nflights are given in the input. If there are multiple solutions for the input,\noutput any of them. Examples Input 3 3 1 2 2 3 1 3 Output Yes 1 1 2 Input 4 4\n1 2 2 3 3 4 1 4 Output No Input 5 6 1 2 2 3 3 5 1 4 4 5 1 3 Output Yes 1 1 1 2\n1 2\n\n",
