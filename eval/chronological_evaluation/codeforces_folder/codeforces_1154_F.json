        "description": "There are \n    n\n shovels in the nearby shop. The \n    i\n-th shovel costs\n\n    a_i\n bourles. Misha has to buy exactly \n    k\n shovels. Each shovel can\nbe bought no more than once. Misha can buy shovels by several purchases.\nDuring one purchase he can choose any subset of remaining (non-bought) shovels\nand buy this subset. There are also \n    m\n special offers in the shop. The\n\n    j\n-th of them is given as a pair \n    (x_j, y_j)\n, and it means that if\nMisha buys exactly \n    x_j\n shovels during one purchase then \n    y_j\n most\ncheapest of them are for free (i.e. he will not pay for \n    y_j\n most\ncheapest shovels during the current purchase). Misha can use any offer any\n(possibly, zero) number of times, but he cannot use more than one offer during\none purchase (but he can buy shovels without using any offers). Your task is\nto calculate the minimum cost of buying \n    k\n shovels, if Misha buys them\noptimally. Input The first line of the input contains three integers \n    n,\n    m\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5, 1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 min(n,\n    2000)\n) \u2014 the number of shovels in the shop, the number of special offers\nand the number of shovels Misha has to buy, correspondingly. The second line\nof the input contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n), where \n    a_i\n is the cost of the\n\n    i\n-th shovel. The next \n    m\n lines contain special offers. The\n\n    j\n-th of them is given as a pair of integers \n    (x_i, y_i)\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    y_i \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 n\n) and means that if Misha buys exactly \n    x_i\n\nshovels during some purchase, then he can take \n    y_i\n most cheapest of them\nfor free. Output Print one integer \u2014 the minimum cost of buying \n    k\n\nshovels if Misha buys them optimally. Examples Input 7 4 5 2 5 4 2 6 3 1 2 1 6\n5 2 1 3 1 Output 7 Input 9 4 8 6 8 5 1 8 1 1 2 1 9 2 8 4 5 3 9 7 Output 17\nInput 5 1 4 2 5 7 4 6 5 4 Output 17 Note In the first example Misha can buy\nshovels on positions \n    1\n and \n    4\n (both with costs \n    2\n) during the\nfirst purchase and get one of them for free using the first or the third\nspecial offer. And then he can buy shovels on positions \n    3\n and \n    6\n\n(with costs \n    4\n and \n    3\n) during the second purchase and get the second\none for free using the first or the third special offer. Then he can buy the\nshovel on a position \n    7\n with cost \n    1\n. So the total cost is \n    4 + 2\n    + 1 = 7\n. In the second example Misha can buy shovels on positions \n    1\n,\n\n    2\n, \n    3\n, \n    4\n and \n    8\n (costs are \n    6\n, \n    8\n, \n    5\n,\n\n    1\n and \n    2\n) and get three cheapest (with costs \n    5\n, \n    1\n and\n\n    2\n) for free. And then he can buy shovels on positions \n    6\n, \n    7\n\nand \n    9\n (all with costs \n    1\n) without using any special offers. So the\ntotal cost is \n    6 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17\n. In the third example Misha can buy\nfour cheapest shovels without using any special offers and get the total cost\n\n    17\n.\n\n",
