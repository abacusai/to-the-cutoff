        "description": "Jett is tired after destroying the town and she wants to have a rest. She\nlikes high places, that's why for having a rest she wants to get high and she\ndecided to craft staircases. A staircase is a squared figure that consists of\nsquare cells. Each staircase consists of an arbitrary number of stairs. If a\nstaircase has \n    n\n stairs, then it is made of \n    n\n columns, the first\ncolumn is \n    1\n cell high, the second column is \n    2\n cells high,\n\n    \u2026\n, the \n    n\n-th column if \n    n\n cells high. The lowest cells\nof all stairs must be in the same row. A staircase with \n    n\n stairs is\ncalled nice, if it may be covered by \n    n\n disjoint squares made of cells.\nAll squares should fully consist of cells of a staircase. This is how a nice\ncovered staircase with \n    7\n stairs looks like: Find out the maximal number\nof different nice staircases, that can be built, using no more than \n    x\n\ncells, in total. No cell can be used more than once. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000)\n \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The description of each test case contains a single integer\n\n    x\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^18)\n \u2014 the number of cells for building\nstaircases. Output For each test case output a single integer \u2014 the number of\ndifferent nice staircases, that can be built, using not more than \n    x\n\ncells, in total. Example Input 4 1 8 6 1000000000000000000 Output 1 2 1 30\nNote In the first test case, it is possible to build only one staircase, that\nconsists of \n    1\n stair. It's nice. That's why the answer is \n    1\n. In the\nsecond test case, it is possible to build two different nice staircases: one\nconsists of \n    1\n stair, and another consists of \n    3\n stairs. This will\ncost \n    7\n cells. In this case, there is one cell left, but it is not\npossible to use it for building any nice staircases, that have not been built\nyet. That's why the answer is \n    2\n. In the third test case, it is possible\nto build only one of two nice staircases: with \n    1\n stair or with \n    3\n\nstairs. In the first case, there will be \n    5\n cells left, that may be used\nonly to build a staircase with \n    2\n stairs. This staircase is not nice, and\nJett only builds nice staircases. That's why in this case the answer is\n\n    1\n. If Jett builds a staircase with \n    3\n stairs, then there are no\nmore cells left, so the answer is \n    1\n again.\n\n",
