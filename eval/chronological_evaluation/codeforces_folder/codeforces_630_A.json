        "description": "The HR manager was disappointed again. The last applicant failed the interview\nthe same way as 24 previous ones. \"Do I give such a hard task?\" \u2014 the HR\nmanager thought. \"Just raise number 5 to the power of n and get last two\ndigits of the number. Yes, of course, n can be rather big, and one cannot find\nthe power using a calculator, but we need people who are able to think, not\njust follow the instructions.\" Could you pass the interview in the machine\nvision company in IT City? Input The only line of the input contains a single\ninteger n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^18) \u2014 the power in which you need to raise number 5.\nOutput Output the last two digits of 5^n without spaces between them. Examples\nInput 2 Output 25\n\n",
