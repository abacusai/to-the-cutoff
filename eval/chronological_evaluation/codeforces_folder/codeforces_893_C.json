        "description": "Vova promised himself that he would never play computer games... But recently\nFirestorm \u2014 a well-known game developing company \u2014 published their newest\ngame, World of Farcraft, and it became really popular. Of course, Vova started\nplaying it. Now he tries to solve a quest. The task is to come to a settlement\nnamed Overcity and spread a rumor in it. Vova knows that there are n\ncharacters in Overcity. Some characters are friends to each other, and they\nshare information they got. Also Vova knows that he can bribe each character\nso he or she starts spreading the rumor; i-th character wants ci gold in\nexchange for spreading the rumor. When a character hears the rumor, he tells\nit to all his friends, and they start spreading the rumor to their friends\n(for free), and so on. The quest is finished when all n characters know the\nrumor. What is the minimum amount of gold Vova needs to spend in order to\nfinish the quest? Take a look at the notes if you think you haven't understood\nthe problem completely. Input The first line contains two integer numbers n\nand m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of characters in Overcity and\nthe number of pairs of friends. The second line contains n integer numbers ci\n(0 \u2264 ci \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the amount of gold i-th character asks to start spreading\nthe rumor. Then m lines follow, each containing a pair of numbers (xi, yi)\nwhich represent that characters xi and yi are friends (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 n, xi \u2260\nyi). It is guaranteed that each pair is listed at most once. Output Print one\nnumber \u2014 the minimum amount of gold Vova has to spend in order to finish the\nquest. Examples Input 5 2 2 5 3 4 8 1 4 4 5 Output 10 Input 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n8 9 10 Output 55 Input 10 5 1 6 2 7 3 8 4 9 5 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Output\n15 Note In the first example the best decision is to bribe the first character\n(he will spread the rumor to fourth character, and the fourth one will spread\nit to fifth). Also Vova has to bribe the second and the third characters, so\nthey know the rumor. In the second example Vova has to bribe everyone. In the\nthird example the optimal decision is to bribe the first, the third, the\nfifth, the seventh and the ninth characters.\n\n",
