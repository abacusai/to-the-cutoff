        "description": "Lee couldn't sleep lately, because he had nightmares. In one of his nightmares\n(which was about an unbalanced global round), he decided to fight back and\npropose a problem below (which you should solve) to balance the round,\nhopefully setting him free from the nightmares. A non-empty array \n    b_1, b_2,\n    \n    \u2026, b_m\n is called good, if there exist \n    m\n integer sequences\nwhich satisfy the following properties: The \n    i\n-th sequence consists of\n\n    b_i\n consecutive integers (for example if \n    b_i = 3\n then the\n\n    i\n-th sequence can be \n    (-1, 0, 1)\n or \n    (-5, -4, -3)\n but not\n\n    (0, -1, 1)\n or \n    (1, 2, 3, 4)\n). Assuming the sum of integers in the\n\n    i\n-th sequence is \n    sum_i\n, we want \n    sum_1 + sum_2 + \n    \u2026 +\n    sum_m\n to be equal to \n    0\n. You are given an array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n. It has \n    2^n - 1\n nonempty subsequences. Find how many of them are\ngood. As this number can be very large, output it modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. An\narray \n    c\n is a subsequence of an array \n    d\n if \n    c\n can be obtained\nfrom \n    d\n by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. Input\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the size of array \n    a\n. The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014\nelements of the array. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of nonempty\ngood subsequences of \n    a\n, modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Examples Input 4 2 2 4 7\nOutput 10 Input 10 12391240 103904 1000000000 4142834 12039 142035823 1032840\n49932183 230194823 984293123 Output 996 Note For the first test, two examples\nof good subsequences are \n    [2, 7]\n and \n    [2, 2, 4, 7]\n: For \n    b = [2,\n    7]\n we can use \n    (-3, -4)\n as the first sequence and \n    (-2, -1,\n    \n    \u2026, 4)\n as the second. Note that subsequence \n    [2, 7]\n appears\ntwice in \n    [2, 2, 4, 7]\n, so we have to count it twice. Green circles\ndenote \n    (-3, -4)\n and orange squares denote \n    (-2, -1, \n    \u2026, 4)\n.\nFor \n    b = [2, 2, 4, 7]\n the following sequences would satisfy the\nproperties: \n    (-1, 0)\n, \n    (-3, -2)\n, \n    (0, 1, 2, 3)\n and \n    (-3, -2,\n    \n    \u2026, 3)\n\n\n",
