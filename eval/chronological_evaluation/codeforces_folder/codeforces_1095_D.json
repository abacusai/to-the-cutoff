        "description": "There are \n    n\n kids, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, dancing in a circle\naround the Christmas tree. Let's enumerate them in a clockwise direction as\n\n    p_1\n, \n    p_2\n, ..., \n    p_n\n (all these numbers are from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n and are distinct, so \n    p\n is a permutation). Let the next kid for a\nkid \n    p_i\n be kid \n    p_i + 1\n if \n    i < n\n and \n    p_1\n otherwise.\nAfter the dance, each kid remembered two kids: the next kid (let's call him\n\n    x\n) and the next kid for \n    x\n. Each kid told you which kids he/she\nremembered: the kid \n    i\n remembered kids \n    a_i, 1\n and \n    a_i, 2\n.\nHowever, the order of \n    a_i, 1\n and \n    a_i, 2\n can differ from their\norder in the circle. Example: 5 kids in a circle, \n    p=[3, 2, 4, 1, 5]\n (or\nany cyclic shift). The information kids remembered is: \n    a_1,1=3\n,\n\n    a_1,2=5\n; \n    a_2,1=1\n, \n    a_2,2=4\n; \n    a_3,1=2\n,\n\n    a_3,2=4\n; \n    a_4,1=1\n, \n    a_4,2=5\n; \n    a_5,1=2\n,\n\n    a_5,2=3\n. You have to restore the order of the kids in the circle using\nthis information. If there are several answers, you may print any. It is\nguaranteed that at least one solution exists. If you are Python programmer,\nconsider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of the kids. The next \n    n\n lines contain\n\n    2\n integers each. The \n    i\n-th line contains two integers \n    a_i,\n    1\n and \n    a_i, 2\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, 1, a_i, 2\n    \u2264 n, a_i, 1\n     a_i, 2\n) \u2014 the kids the \n    i\n-th kid remembered, given in\narbitrary order. Output Print \n    n\n integers \n    p_1\n, \n    p_2\n, ...,\n\n    p_n\n \u2014 permutation of integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, which corresponds\nto the order of kids in the circle. If there are several answers, you may\nprint any (for example, it doesn't matter which kid is the first in the\ncircle). It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists. Examples Input 5\n3 5 1 4 2 4 1 5 2 3 Output 3 2 4 1 5 Input 3 2 3 3 1 1 2 Output 3 1 2\n\n",
