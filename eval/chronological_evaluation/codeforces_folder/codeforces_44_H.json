        "description": "Alas, finding one's true love is not easy. Masha has been unsuccessful in that\nyet. Her friend Dasha told Masha about a way to determine the phone number of\none's Prince Charming through arithmancy. The phone number is divined like\nthat. First one needs to write down one's own phone numbers. For example,\nlet's suppose that Masha's phone number is 12345. After that one should write\nher favorite digit from 0 to 9 under the first digit of her number. That will\nbe the first digit of the needed number. For example, Masha's favorite digit\nis 9. The second digit is determined as a half sum of the second digit of\nMasha's number and the already written down first digit from her beloved one's\nnumber. In this case the arithmetic average equals to (2 + 9) / 2 = 5.5. Masha\ncan round the number up or down, depending on her wishes. For example, she\nchooses the digit 5. Having written down the resulting digit under the second\ndigit of her number, Masha moves to finding the third digit in the same way,\ni.e. finding the half sum the the third digit of her number and the second\ndigit of the new number. The result is (5 + 3) / 2 = 4. In this case the\nanswer is unique. Thus, every i-th digit is determined as an arithmetic\naverage of the i-th digit of Masha's number and the i - 1-th digit of her true\nlove's number. If needed, the digit can be rounded up or down. For example,\nMasha can get: 12345 95444 Unfortunately, when Masha tried dialing the number,\nshe got disappointed: as it turned out, the number was unavailable or outside\nthe coverage area. But Masha won't give up. Perhaps, she rounded to a wrong\ndigit or chose the first digit badly. That's why she keeps finding more and\nmore new numbers and calling them. Count the number of numbers Masha calls.\nMasha calls all the possible numbers that can be found by the described means\nof arithmancy, except for, perhaps, her own one. Input The first line contains\nnonempty sequence consisting of digits from 0 to 9 \u2014 Masha's phone number. The\nsequence length does not exceed 50. Output Output the single number \u2014 the\nnumber of phone numbers Masha will dial. Examples Input 12345 Output 48 Input\n09 Output 15\n\n",
