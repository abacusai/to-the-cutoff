        "description": "Ivan plays an old action game called Heretic. He's stuck on one of the final\nlevels of this game, so he needs some help with killing the monsters. The main\npart of the level is a large corridor (so large and narrow that it can be\nrepresented as an infinite coordinate line). The corridor is divided into two\nparts; let's assume that the point \n    x = 0\n is where these parts meet. The\nright part of the corridor is filled with \n    n\n monsters \u2014 for each monster,\nits initial coordinate \n    x_i\n is given (and since all monsters are in the\nright part, every \n    x_i\n is positive). The left part of the corridor is\nfilled with crusher traps. If some monster enters the left part of the\ncorridor or the origin (so, its current coordinate becomes less than or equal\nto \n    0\n), it gets instantly killed by a trap. The main weapon Ivan uses to\nkill the monsters is the Phoenix Rod. It can launch a missile that explodes\nupon impact, obliterating every monster caught in the explosion and throwing\nall other monsters away from the epicenter. Formally, suppose that Ivan\nlaunches a missile so that it explodes in the point \n    c\n. Then every\nmonster is either killed by explosion or pushed away. Let some monster's\ncurrent coordinate be \n    y\n, then: if \n    c = y\n, then the monster is\nkilled; if \n    y < c\n, then the monster is pushed \n    r\n units to the left,\nso its current coordinate becomes \n    y - r\n; if \n    y > c\n, then the\nmonster is pushed \n    r\n units to the right, so its current coordinate\nbecomes \n    y + r\n. Ivan is going to kill the monsters as follows: choose\nsome integer point \n    d\n and launch a missile into that point, then wait\nuntil it explodes and all the monsters which are pushed to the left part of\nthe corridor are killed by crusher traps, then, if at least one monster is\nstill alive, choose another integer point (probably the one that was already\nused) and launch a missile there, and so on. What is the minimum number of\nmissiles Ivan has to launch in order to kill all of the monsters? You may\nassume that every time Ivan fires the Phoenix Rod, he chooses the impact point\noptimally. You have to answer \n    q\n independent queries. Input The first\nline contains one integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\nqueries. The first line of each query contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, r \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of enemies and the\ndistance that the enemies are thrown away from the epicenter of the explosion.\nThe second line of each query contains \n    n\n integers \n    x_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    x_i \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the initial positions of the monsters. It is guaranteed\nthat sum of all \n    n\n over all queries does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output\nFor each query print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of shots from the\nPhoenix Rod required to kill all monsters. Example Input 2 3 2 1 3 5 4 1 5 2 3\n5 Output 2 2 Note In the first test case, Ivan acts as follows: choose the\npoint \n    3\n, the first monster dies from a crusher trap at the point\n\n    -1\n, the second monster dies from the explosion, the third monster is\npushed to the point \n    7\n; choose the point \n    7\n, the third monster dies\nfrom the explosion. In the second test case, Ivan acts as follows: choose the\npoint \n    5\n, the first and fourth monsters die from the explosion, the\nsecond monster is pushed to the point \n    1\n, the third monster is pushed to\nthe point \n    2\n; choose the point \n    2\n, the first monster dies from a\ncrusher trap at the point \n    0\n, the second monster dies from the explosion.\n\n",
