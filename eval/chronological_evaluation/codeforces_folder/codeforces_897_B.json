But I have to leave now... \u2014 One last request, can\nyou... \u2014 Help me solve a Codeforces problem? \u2014 ...... \u2014 What? Chtholly has\nbeen thinking about a problem for days: If a number is palindrome and length\nof its decimal representation without leading zeros is even, we call it a zcy\nnumber. A number is palindrome means when written in decimal representation,\nit contains no leading zeros and reads the same forwards and backwards. For\nexample 12321 and 1221 are palindromes and 123 and 12451 are not. Moreover,\n1221 is zcy number and 12321 is not. Given integers k and p, calculate the sum\nof the k smallest zcy numbers and output this sum modulo p. Unfortunately,\nWillem isn't good at solving this kind of problems, so he asks you for help!\nInput The first line contains two integers k and p (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 p \u2264\n10^9). Output Output single integer \u2014 answer to the problem. Examples Input 2\n100 Output 33 Input 5 30 Output 15 Note In the first example, the smallest zcy\nnumber is 11, and the second smallest zcy number is 22. In the second example,\n.\n\n",
