        "description": "The R1 company has recently bought a high rise building in the centre of\nMoscow for its main office. It's time to decorate the new office, and the\nfirst thing to do is to write the company's slogan above the main entrance to\nthe building. The slogan of the company consists of n characters, so the\ndecorators hung a large banner, n meters wide and 1 meter high, divided into n\nequal squares. The first character of the slogan must be in the first square\n(the leftmost) of the poster, the second character must be in the second\nsquare, and so on. Of course, the R1 programmers want to write the slogan on\nthe poster themselves. To do this, they have a large (and a very heavy) ladder\nwhich was put exactly opposite the k-th square of the poster. To draw the i-th\ncharacter of the slogan on the poster, you need to climb the ladder, standing\nin front of the i-th square of the poster. This action (along with climbing up\nand down the ladder) takes one hour for a painter. The painter is not allowed\nto draw characters in the adjacent squares when the ladder is in front of the\ni-th square because the uncomfortable position of the ladder may make the\ncharacters untidy. Besides, the programmers can move the ladder. In one hour,\nthey can move the ladder either a meter to the right or a meter to the left.\nDrawing characters and moving the ladder is very tiring, so the programmers\nwant to finish the job in as little time as possible. Develop for them an\noptimal poster painting plan! Input The first line contains two integers, n\nand k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of characters in the slogan and the\ninitial position of the ladder, correspondingly. The next line contains the\nslogan as n characters written without spaces. Each character of the slogan is\neither a large English letter, or digit, or one of the characters: '.', '!',\n',', '?'. Output In t lines, print the actions the programmers need to make.\nIn the i-th line print: \"LEFT\" (without the quotes), if the i-th action was\n\"move the ladder to the left\"; \"RIGHT\" (without the quotes), if the i-th\naction was \"move the ladder to the right\"; \"PRINT x\" (without the quotes), if\nthe i-th action was to \"go up the ladder, paint character x, go down the\nladder\". The painting time (variable t) must be minimum possible. If there are\nmultiple optimal painting plans, you can print any of them. Examples Input 2 2\nR1 Output PRINT 1 LEFT PRINT R Input 2 1 R1 Output PRINT R RIGHT PRINT 1 Input\n6 4 GO?GO! Output RIGHT RIGHT PRINT ! LEFT PRINT O LEFT PRINT G LEFT PRINT ?\nLEFT PRINT O LEFT PRINT G Note Note that the ladder cannot be shifted by less\nthan one meter. The ladder can only stand in front of some square of the\nposter. For example, you cannot shift a ladder by half a meter and position it\nbetween two squares. Then go up and paint the first character and the second\ncharacter.\n\n",
