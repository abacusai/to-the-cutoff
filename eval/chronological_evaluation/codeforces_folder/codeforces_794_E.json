        "name": "Choosing Carrot",
        "description": "Oleg the bank client and Igor the analyst are arguing again. This time, they\nwant to pick a gift as a present for their friend, ZS the coder. After a long\nthought, they decided that their friend loves to eat carrots the most and thus\nthey want to pick the best carrot as their present. There are n carrots\narranged in a line. The i-th carrot from the left has juiciness ai. Oleg\nthinks ZS loves juicy carrots whereas Igor thinks that he hates juicy carrots.\nThus, Oleg would like to maximize the juiciness of the carrot they choose\nwhile Igor would like to minimize the juiciness of the carrot they choose. To\nsettle this issue, they decided to play a game again. Oleg and Igor take turns\nto play the game. In each turn, a player can choose a carrot from either end\nof the line, and eat it. The game ends when only one carrot remains. Oleg\nmoves first. The last remaining carrot will be the carrot that they will give\ntheir friend, ZS. Oleg is a sneaky bank client. When Igor goes to a restroom,\nhe performs k moves before the start of the game. Each move is the same as\nabove (eat a carrot from either end of the line). After Igor returns, they\nstart the game with Oleg still going first. Oleg wonders: for each k such that\n0 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 1, what is the juiciness of the carrot they will give to ZS if he\nmakes k extra moves beforehand and both players play optimally? Input The\nfirst line of input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 the total\nnumber of carrots. The next line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2,\n..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9). Here ai denotes the juiciness of the i-th carrot from\nthe left of the line. Output Output n space-separated integers x0, x1, ..., xn\n- 1. Here, xi denotes the juiciness of the carrot the friends will present to\nZS if k = i. Examples Input 4 1 2 3 5 Output 3 3 5 5 Input 5 1000000000\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1 Output 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n1000000000 1000000000 Note For the first example, When k = 0, one possible\noptimal game is as follows: Oleg eats the carrot with juiciness 1. Igor eats\nthe carrot with juiciness 5. Oleg eats the carrot with juiciness 2. The\nremaining carrot has juiciness 3.When k = 1, one possible optimal play is as\nfollows: Oleg eats the carrot with juiciness 1 beforehand. Oleg eats the\ncarrot with juiciness 2. Igor eats the carrot with juiciness 5. The remaining\ncarrot has juiciness 3.When k = 2, one possible optimal play is as follows:\nOleg eats the carrot with juiciness 1 beforehand. Oleg eats the carrot with\njuiciness 2 beforehand. Oleg eats the carrot with juiciness 3. The remaining\ncarrot has juiciness 5.When k = 3, one possible optimal play is as follows:\nOleg eats the carrot with juiciness 1 beforehand. Oleg eats the carrot with\njuiciness 2 beforehand. Oleg eats the carrot with juiciness 3 beforehand. The\nremaining carrot has juiciness 5.Thus, the answer is 3, 3, 5, 5. For the\nsecond sample, Oleg can always eat the carrot with juiciness 1 since he always\nmoves first. So, the remaining carrot will always have juiciness 1000000000.\n\n",
