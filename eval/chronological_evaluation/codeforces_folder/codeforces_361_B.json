        "description": "Levko loves permutations very much. A permutation of length n is a sequence of\ndistinct positive integers, each is at most n. Let\u2019s assume that value gcd(a,\nb) shows the greatest common divisor of numbers a and b. Levko assumes that\nelement pi of permutation p1, p2, ... , pn is good if gcd(i, pi) > 1. Levko\nconsiders a permutation beautiful, if it has exactly k good elements.\nUnfortunately, he doesn\u2019t know any beautiful permutation. Your task is to help\nhim to find at least one of them. Input The single line contains two integers\nn and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n). Output In a single line print either any\nbeautiful permutation or -1, if such permutation doesn\u2019t exist. If there are\nmultiple suitable permutations, you are allowed to print any of them. Examples\nInput 4 2 Output 2 4 3 1 Input 1 1 Output -1 Note In the first sample elements\n4 and 3 are good because gcd(2, 4) = 2 > 1 and gcd(3, 3) = 3 > 1. Elements 2\nand 1 are not good because gcd(1, 2) = 1 and gcd(4, 1) = 1. As there are\nexactly 2 good elements, the permutation is beautiful. The second sample has\nno beautiful permutations.\n\n",
