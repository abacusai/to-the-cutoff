        "description": "Recently a new building with a new layout was constructed in Monocarp's\nhometown. According to this new layout, the building consists of three types\nof apartments: three-room, five-room, and seven-room apartments. It's also\nknown that each room of each apartment has exactly one window. In other words,\na three-room apartment has three windows, a five-room \u2014 five windows, and a\nseven-room \u2014 seven windows. Monocarp went around the building and counted\n\n    n\n windows. Now he is wondering, how many apartments of each type the\nbuilding may have. Unfortunately, Monocarp only recently has learned to count,\nso he is asking you to help him to calculate the possible quantities of three-\nroom, five-room, and seven-room apartments in the building that has \n    n\n\nwindows. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them. Here are\nsome examples: if Monocarp has counted \n    30\n windows, there could have been\n\n    2\n three-room apartments, \n    2\n five-room apartments and \n    2\n seven-\nroom apartments, since \n    2 \n    \u00b7 3 + 2 \n    \u00b7 5 + 2 \n    \u00b7 7 = 30\n; if\nMonocarp has counted \n    67\n windows, there could have been \n    7\n three-\nroom apartments, \n    5\n five-room apartments and \n    3\n seven-room\napartments, since \n    7 \n    \u00b7 3 + 5 \n    \u00b7 5 + 3 \n    \u00b7 7 = 67\n; if\nMonocarp has counted \n    4\n windows, he should have mistaken since no\nbuilding with the aforementioned layout can have \n    4\n windows. Input Th\nfirst line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. The only line of each test case contains one integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of windows in the building.\nOutput For each test case, if a building with the new layout and the given\nnumber of windows just can't exist, print \n    -1\n. Otherwise, print three\nnon-negative integers \u2014 the possible number of three-room, five-room, and\nseven-room apartments. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nExample Input 4 30 67 4 14 Output 2 2 2 7 5 3 -1 0 0 2\n\n",
