        "description": "Vika's house has a room in a shape of a rectangular parallelepiped (also known\nas a rectangular cuboid). Its floor is a rectangle of size \n    w \n    \u00d7 d\n,\nand the ceiling is right above at the constant height of \n    h\n. Let's\nintroduce a coordinate system on the floor so that its corners are at points\n\n    (0, 0)\n, \n    (w, 0)\n, \n    (w, d)\n, and \n    (0, d)\n. A laptop is\nstanding on the floor at point \n    (a, b)\n. A projector is hanging on the\nceiling right above point \n    (f, g)\n. Vika wants to connect the laptop and\nthe projector with a cable in such a way that the cable always goes along the\nwalls, ceiling, or floor (i. e. does not go inside the cuboid). Additionally,\nthe cable should always run parallel to one of the cuboid's edges (i. e. it\ncan not go diagonally). What is the minimum length of a cable that can connect\nthe laptop to the projector? Illustration for the first test case. One of the\noptimal ways to put the cable is shown in green. Input Each test contains\nmultiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). The description of the test cases follows. The\nfirst line of each test case contains three integers \n    w\n, \n    d\n, and\n\n    h\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 w, d, h \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the size of the room. The second\nline contains four integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    f\n, \n    g\n (\n    0 < a, f <\n    w\n; \n    0 < b, g < d\n): the laptop is located on the floor at point \n    (a,\n    b)\n, while the projector is hanging on the ceiling right above point \n    (f,\n    g)\n. Output For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum length\nof the cable connecting the laptop and the projector that runs only along the\nwalls, floor, and ceiling parallel to cuboid's edges.
