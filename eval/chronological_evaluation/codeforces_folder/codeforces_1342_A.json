        "description": "You are given two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n. You can perform two types of\noperations: Pay \n    a\n dollars and increase or decrease any of these integers\nby \n    1\n. For example, if \n    x = 0\n and \n    y = 7\n there are four\npossible outcomes after this operation: \n    x = 0\n, \n    y = 6\n; \n    x = 0\n,\n\n    y = 8\n; \n    x = -1\n, \n    y = 7\n; \n    x = 1\n, \n    y = 7\n. Pay \n    b\n\ndollars and increase or decrease both integers by \n    1\n. For example, if\n\n    x = 0\n and \n    y = 7\n there are two possible outcomes after this\noperation: \n    x = -1\n, \n    y = 6\n; \n    x = 1\n, \n    y = 8\n. Your goal is\nto make both given integers equal zero simultaneously, i.e. \n    x = y = 0\n.\nThere are no other requirements. In particular, it is possible to move from\n\n    x=1\n, \n    y=0\n to \n    x=y=0\n. Calculate the minimum amount of dollars\nyou have to spend on it. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. The first line of each\ntest case contains two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n). The second line of each test case contains two integers \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Output For each test case print one\ninteger \u2014 the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend. Example Input 2 1 3\n391 555 0 0 9 4 Output 1337 0 Note In the first test case you can perform the\nfollowing sequence of operations: first, second, first. This way you spend\n\n    391 + 555 + 391 = 1337\n dollars. In the second test case both integers\nare equal to zero initially, so you dont' have to spend money.\n\n",
