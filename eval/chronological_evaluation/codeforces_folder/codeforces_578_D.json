        "description": "You are given a string S of length n with each character being one of the\nfirst m lowercase English letters. Calculate how many different strings T of\nlength n composed from the first m lowercase English letters exist such that\nthe length of LCS (longest common subsequence) between S and T is n - 1.\nRecall that LCS of two strings S and T is the longest string C such that C\nboth in S and T as a subsequence. Input The first line contains two numbers n\nand m denoting the length of string S and number of first English lowercase\ncharacters forming the character set for strings (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 2 \u2264 m \u2264\n26). The second line contains string S. Output Print the only line containing\nthe answer. Examples Input 3 3 aaa Output 6 Input 3 3 aab Output 11 Input 1 2\na Output 1 Input 10 9 abacadefgh Output 789 Note For the first sample, the 6\npossible strings T are: aab, aac, aba, aca, baa, caa. For the second sample,\nthe 11 possible strings T are: aaa, aac, aba, abb, abc, aca, acb, baa, bab,\ncaa, cab. For the third sample, the only possible string T is b.\n\n",
