        "name": "Dima and To-do List",
        "description": "You helped Dima to have a great weekend, but it's time to work. Naturally,\nDima, as all other men who have girlfriends, does everything wrong. Inna and\nDima are now in one room. Inna tells Dima off for everything he does in her\npresence. After Inna tells him off for something, she goes to another room,\nwalks there in circles muttering about how useless her sweetheart is. During\nthat time Dima has time to peacefully complete k - 1 tasks. Then Inna returns\nand tells Dima off for the next task he does in her presence and goes to\nanother room again. It continues until Dima is through with his tasks.\nOverall, Dima has n tasks to do, each task has a unique number from 1 to n.\nDima loves order, so he does tasks consecutively, starting from some task. For\nexample, if Dima has 6 tasks to do in total, then, if he starts from the 5-th\ntask, the order is like that: first Dima does the 5-th task, then the 6-th\none, then the 1-st one, then the 2-nd one, then the 3-rd one, then the 4-th\none. Inna tells Dima off (only lovingly and appropriately!) so often and\nsystematically that he's very well learned the power with which she tells him\noff for each task. Help Dima choose the first task so that in total he gets\ntold off with as little power as possible. Input The first line of the input\ncontains two integers n, k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The second line contains n\nintegers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^3), where ai is the power Inna tells\nDima off with if she is present in the room while he is doing the i-th task.\nIt is guaranteed that n is divisible by k. Output In a single line print the\nnumber of the task Dima should start with to get told off with as little power\nas possible. If there are multiple solutions, print the one with the minimum\nnumber of the first task to do. Examples Input 6 2 3 2 1 6 5 4 Output 1 Input\n10 5 1 3 5 7 9 9 4 1 8 5 Output 3 Note Explanation of the first example. If\nDima starts from the first task, Inna tells him off with power 3, then Dima\ncan do one more task (as k = 2), then Inna tells him off for the third task\nwith power 1, then she tells him off for the fifth task with power 5. Thus,\nDima gets told off with total power 3 + 1 + 5 = 9. If Dima started from the\nsecond task, for example, then Inna would tell him off for tasks 2, 4 and 6\nwith power 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. Explanation of the second example. In the second\nexample k = 5, thus, Dima manages to complete 4 tasks in-between the telling\noff sessions. Thus, Inna tells Dima off for tasks number 1 and 6 (if he starts\nfrom 1 or 6), 2 and 7 (if he starts from 2 or 7) and so on. The optimal answer\nis to start from task 3 or 8, 3 has a smaller number, so the answer is 3.\n\n",
