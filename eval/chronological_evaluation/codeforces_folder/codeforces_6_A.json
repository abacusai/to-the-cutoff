        "description": "Johnny has a younger sister Anne, who is very clever and smart. As she came\nhome from the kindergarten, she told his brother about the task that her\nkindergartener asked her to solve. The task was just to construct a triangle\nout of four sticks of different colours. Naturally, one of the sticks is\nextra. It is not allowed to break the sticks or use their partial length. Anne\nhas perfectly solved this task, now she is asking Johnny to do the same. The\nboy answered that he would cope with it without any difficulty. However, after\na while he found out that different tricky things can occur. It can happen\nthat it is impossible to construct a triangle of a positive area, but it is\npossible to construct a degenerate triangle. It can be so, that it is\nimpossible to construct a degenerate triangle even. As Johnny is very lazy, he\ndoes not want to consider such a big amount of cases, he asks you to help him.\nInput The first line of the input contains four space-separated positive\ninteger numbers not exceeding 100 \u2014 lengthes of the sticks. Output Output\nTRIANGLE if it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle. Output\nSEGMENT if the first case cannot take place and it is possible to construct a\ndegenerate triangle. Output IMPOSSIBLE if it is impossible to construct any\ntriangle. Remember that you are to use three sticks. It is not allowed to\nbreak the sticks or use their partial length. Examples Input 4 2 1 3 Output\nTRIANGLE Input 7 2 2 4 Output SEGMENT Input 3 5 9 1 Output IMPOSSIBLE\n\n",
