        "description": "Vasily has a deck of cards consisting of n cards. There is an integer on each\nof the cards, this integer is between 1 and 100 000, inclusive. It is possible\nthat some cards have the same integers on them. Vasily decided to sort the\ncards. To do this, he repeatedly takes the top card from the deck, and if the\nnumber on it equals the minimum number written on the cards in the deck, then\nhe places the card away. Otherwise, he puts it under the deck and takes the\nnext card from the top, and so on. The process ends as soon as there are no\ncards in the deck. You can assume that Vasily always knows the minimum number\nwritten on some card in the remaining deck, but doesn't know where this card\n(or these cards) is. You are to determine the total number of times Vasily\ntakes the top card from the deck. Input The first line contains single integer\nn (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of cards in the deck. The second line\ncontains a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 100 000), where ai\nis the number written on the i-th from top card in the deck. Output Print the\ntotal number of times Vasily takes the top card from the deck. Examples Input\n4 6 3 1 2 Output 7 Input 1 1000 Output 1 Input 7 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 Output 7 Note\nIn the first example Vasily at first looks at the card with number 6 on it,\nputs it under the deck, then on the card with number 3, puts it under the\ndeck, and then on the card with number 1. He places away the card with 1,\nbecause the number written on it is the minimum among the remaining cards.\nAfter that the cards from top to bottom are [2, 6, 3]. Then Vasily looks at\nthe top card with number 2 and puts it away. After that the cards from top to\nbottom are [6, 3]. Then Vasily looks at card 6, puts it under the deck, then\nat card 3 and puts it away. Then there is only one card with number 6 on it,\nand Vasily looks at it and puts it away. Thus, in total Vasily looks at 7\ncards.\n\n",
