        "description": "Ashish has two strings \n    a\n and \n    b\n, each of length \n    n\n, and an\ninteger \n    k\n. The strings only contain lowercase English letters. He wants\nto convert string \n    a\n into string \n    b\n by performing some (possibly\nzero) operations on \n    a\n. In one move, he can either choose an index\n\n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i\n    \u2264 n-1\n) and swap \n    a_i\n and \n    a_i+1\n, or\nchoose an index \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n-k+1\n) and if \n    a_i,\n    a_i+1, \n    \u2026, a_i+k-1\n are all equal to some character \n    c\n (\n    c\n    \n    \u2260\n 'z'), replace each one with the next character \n    (c+1)\n, that is,\n'a' is replaced by 'b', 'b' is replaced by 'c' and so on. Note that he can\nperform any number of operations, and the operations can only be performed on\nstring \n    a\n. Help Ashish determine if it is possible to convert string\n\n    a\n into \n    b\n after performing some (possibly zero) operations on it.\nInput The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n). The second\nline of each test case contains the string \n    a\n of length \n    n\n\nconsisting of lowercase English letters. The third line of each test case\ncontains the string \n    b\n of length \n    n\n consisting of lowercase English\nletters. It is guaranteed that the sum of values \n    n\n among all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    10^6\n. Output For each test case, print \"Yes\" if Ashish\ncan convert \n    a\n into \n    b\n after some moves, else print \"No\". You may\nprint the letters of the answer in any case (upper or lower). Example Input 4\n3 3 abc bcd 4 2 abba azza 2 1 zz aa 6 2 aaabba ddddcc Output No Yes No Yes\nNote In the first test case it can be shown that it is impossible to convert\n\n    a\n into \n    b\n. In the second test case, \"abba\"\n\n    \n \"acca\" \n    \n\n\n    \u2026\n \n    \n \"azza\". Here \"swap\" denotes\nan operation of the first type, and \"inc\" denotes an operation of the second\ntype. In the fourth test case, \"aaabba\" \n    \n\n\"aaabab\" \n    \n \"aaaabb\"\n\n    \n \n    \u2026\n\n\n    \n \"ddaabb\" \n    \n\n\n    \u2026\n \n    \n \"ddddbb\"\n\n    \n \n    \u2026\n\n\n    \n \"ddddcc\".\n\n",
