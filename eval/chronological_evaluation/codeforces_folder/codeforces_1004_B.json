        "description": "Sonya decided to organize an exhibition of flowers. Since the girl likes only\nroses and lilies, she decided that only these two kinds of flowers should be\nin this exhibition. There are \n    n\n flowers in a row in the exhibition.\nSonya can put either a rose or a lily in the \n    i\n-th position. Thus each of\n\n    n\n positions should contain exactly one flower: a rose or a lily. She\nknows that exactly \n    m\n people will visit this exhibition. The \n    i\n-th\nvisitor will visit all flowers from \n    l_i\n to \n    r_i\n inclusive. The girl\nknows that each segment has its own beauty that is equal to the product of the\nnumber of roses and the number of lilies. Sonya wants her exhibition to be\nliked by a lot of people. That is why she wants to put the flowers in such way\nthat the sum of beauties of all segments would be maximum possible. Input The\nfirst line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n, m\n    \u2264\n    10^3\n) \u2014 the number of flowers and visitors respectively. Each of the next\n\n    m\n lines contains two integers \n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n (\n    1\n    \u2264\n    l_i\n    \u2264 r_i\n    \u2264 n\n), meaning that \n    i\n-th visitor will visit all\nflowers from \n    l_i\n to \n    r_i\n inclusive. Output Print the string of\n\n    n\n characters. The \n    i\n-th symbol should be \u00ab0\u00bb if you want to put a\nrose in the \n    i\n-th position, otherwise \u00ab1\u00bb if you want to put a lily. If\nthere are multiple answers, print any. Examples Input 5 3 1 3 2 4 2 5 Output\n01100 Input 6 3 5 6 1 4 4 6 Output 110010 Note In the first example, Sonya can\nput roses in the first, fourth, and fifth positions, and lilies in the second\nand third positions; in the segment \n    [1\n    \u20263]\n, there are one rose and\ntwo lilies, so the beauty is equal to \n    1\n    \u00b7 2=2\n; in the segment\n\n    [2\n    \u20264]\n, there are one rose and two lilies, so the beauty is equal\nto \n    1\n    \u00b7 2=2\n; in the segment \n    [2\n    \u20265]\n, there are two roses\nand two lilies, so the beauty is equal to \n    2\n    \u00b7 2=4\n. The total beauty\nis equal to \n    2+2+4=8\n. In the second example, Sonya can put roses in the\nthird, fourth, and sixth positions, and lilies in the first, second, and fifth\npositions; in the segment \n    [5\n    \u20266]\n, there are one rose and one lily,\nso the beauty is equal to \n    1\n    \u00b7 1=1\n; in the segment\n\n    [1\n    \u20264]\n, there are two roses and two lilies, so the beauty is equal\nto \n    2\n    \u00b7 2=4\n; in the segment \n    [4\n    \u20266]\n, there are two roses\nand one lily, so the beauty is equal to \n    2\n    \u00b7 1=2\n. The total beauty\nis equal to \n    1+4+2=7\n.\n\n",
