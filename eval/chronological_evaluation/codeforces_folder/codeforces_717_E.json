        "description": "I see a pink boar and I want it painted black. Black boars look much more\nawesome and mighty than the pink ones. Since Jaggy became the ruler of the\nforest, he has been trying his best to improve the diplomatic relations\nbetween the forest region and the nearby ones. Some other rulers, however,\nhave requested too much in return for peace between their two regions, so he\nrealized he has to resort to intimidation. Once a delegate for diplomatic\nrelations of a neighboring region visits Jaggy\u2019s forest, if they see a whole\nbunch of black boars, they might suddenly change their mind about attacking\nJaggy. Black boars are really scary, after all. Jaggy\u2019s forest can be\nrepresented as a tree (connected graph without cycles) with n vertices. Each\nvertex represents a boar and is colored either black or pink. Jaggy has sent a\nsquirrel to travel through the forest and paint all the boars black. The\nsquirrel, however, is quite unusually trained and while it traverses the\ngraph, it changes the color of every vertex it visits, regardless of its\ninitial color: pink vertices become black and black vertices become pink.\nSince Jaggy is too busy to plan the squirrel\u2019s route, he needs your help. He\nwants you to construct a walk through the tree starting from vertex 1 such\nthat in the end all vertices are black. A walk is a sequence of vertices, such\nthat every consecutive pair has an edge between them in a tree. Input The\nfirst line of input contains integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000), denoting the number\nof vertices in the tree. The following n lines contains n integers, which\nrepresent the color of the nodes. If the i-th integer is 1, if the i-th vertex\nis black and - 1 if the i-th vertex is pink. Each of the next n - 1 lines\ncontains two integers, which represent the indexes of the vertices which are\nconnected by the edge. Vertices are numbered starting with 1. Output Output\npath of a squirrel: output a sequence of visited nodes' indexes in order of\nvisiting. In case of all the nodes are initially black, you should print 1.\nSolution is guaranteed to exist. If there are multiple solutions to the\nproblem you can output any of them provided length of sequence is not longer\nthan 10^7. Example Input 5 1 1 -1 1 -1 2 5 4 3 2 4 4 1 Output 1 4 2 5 2 4 3 4\n1 4 1 Note At the beginning squirrel is at node 1 and its color is black. Next\nsteps are as follows: From node 1 we walk to node 4 and change its color to\npink. From node 4 we walk to node 2 and change its color to pink. From node 2\nwe walk to node 5 and change its color to black. From node 5 we return to node\n2 and change its color to black. From node 2 we walk to node 4 and change its\ncolor to black. We visit node 3 and change its color to black. We visit node 4\nand change its color to pink. We visit node 1 and change its color to pink. We\nvisit node 4 and change its color to black. We visit node 1 and change its\ncolor to black.\n\n",
