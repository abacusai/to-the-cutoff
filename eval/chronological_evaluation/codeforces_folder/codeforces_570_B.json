        "description": "One day Misha and Andrew were playing a very simple game. First, each player\nchooses an integer in the range from 1 to n. Let's assume that Misha chose\nnumber m, and Andrew chose number a. Then, by using a random generator they\nchoose a random integer c in the range between 1 and n (any integer from 1 to\nn is chosen with the same probability), after which the winner is the player,\nwhose number was closer to c. The boys agreed that if m and a are located on\nthe same distance from c, Misha wins. Andrew wants to win very much, so he\nasks you to help him. You know the number selected by Misha, and number n. You\nneed to determine which value of a Andrew must choose, so that the probability\nof his victory is the highest possible. More formally, you need to find such\ninteger a (1 \u2264 a \u2264 n), that the probability that is maximal, where c is the\nequiprobably chosen integer from 1 to n (inclusive). Input The first line\ncontains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 n \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the range of numbers in the\ngame, and the number selected by Misha respectively. Output Print a single\nnumber \u2014 such value a, that probability that Andrew wins is the highest. If\nthere are multiple such values, print the minimum of them. Examples Input 3 1\nOutput 2 Input 4 3 Output 2 Note In the first sample test: Andrew wins if c is\nequal to 2 or 3. The probability that Andrew wins is 2 / 3. If Andrew chooses\na = 3, the probability of winning will be 1 / 3. If a = 1, the probability of\nwinning is 0. In the second sample test: Andrew wins if c is equal to 1 and 2.\nThe probability that Andrew wins is 1 / 2. For other choices of a the\nprobability of winning is less.\n\n",
