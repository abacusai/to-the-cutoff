        "description": "A and B are preparing themselves for programming contests. An important part\nof preparing for a competition is sharing programming knowledge from the\nexperienced members to those who are just beginning to deal with the contests.\nTherefore, during the next team training A decided to make teams so that\nnewbies are solving problems together with experienced participants. A\nbelieves that the optimal team of three people should consist of one\nexperienced participant and two newbies. Thus, each experienced participant\ncan share the experience with a large number of people. However, B believes\nthat the optimal team should have two experienced members plus one newbie.\nThus, each newbie can gain more knowledge and experience. As a result, A and B\nhave decided that all the teams during the training session should belong to\none of the two types described above. Furthermore, they agree that the total\nnumber of teams should be as much as possible. There are n experienced members\nand m newbies on the training session. Can you calculate what maximum number\nof teams can be formed? Input The first line contains two integers n and m (0\n\u2264 n, m \u2264 5\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of experienced participants and newbies that are\npresent at the training session. Output Print the maximum number of teams that\ncan be formed. Examples Input 2 6 Output 2 Input 4 5 Output 3 Note Let's\nrepresent the experienced players as XP and newbies as NB. In the first test\nthe teams look as follows: (XP, NB, NB), (XP, NB, NB). In the second test\nsample the teams look as follows: (XP, NB, NB), (XP, NB, NB), (XP, XP, NB).\n\n",
