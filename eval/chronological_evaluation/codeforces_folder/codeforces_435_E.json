        "description": "In this problem you will need to deal with an n \u00d7 m grid graph. The graph's\nvertices are the nodes of the n \u00d7 m grid. The graph's edges are all the sides\nand diagonals of the grid's unit squares. The figure below shows a 3 \u00d7 5\ngraph. The black lines are the graph's edges, the colored circles are the\ngraph's vertices. The vertices of the graph are painted on the picture for a\nreason: the coloring is a correct vertex coloring of the 3 \u00d7 5 graph into four\ncolors. A graph coloring is correct if and only if each vertex is painted and\nno two vertices connected by an edge are painted the same color. You are given\nthe size of the grid graph n \u00d7 m and the colors of some of its vertices. Find\nany way how to paint the unpainted vertices of the graph in 4 colors to make\nthe final coloring a correct vertex graph coloring. If there is no such\ncorrect vertex coloring, say that the answer doesn't exist. Input The first\nline contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000). Each of the next n lines\nconsists of m characters \u2014 the given graph. Each character is either \u00ab0\u00bb, \u00ab1\u00bb,\n\u00ab2\u00bb, \u00ab3\u00bb, \u00ab4\u00bb. Character \u00ab0\u00bb means that the corresponding vertex is unpainted,\notherwise the character means the color of the vertex. Assume that all the\navailable colors are numbered from 1 to 4. Output If there is no way to get\ncorrect vertex coloring of the graph, print 0 in a single line. Otherwise\nprint the colored n \u00d7 m graph. Print the graph in the same format as in the\ninput. If multiple answers exist, print any of them. Examples Input 3 5 10101\n00020 01000 Output 13131 42424 31313 Input 2 2 00 00 Output 12 34 Input 2 2 11\n00 Output 0 Note The answer to the first sample is shown on the picture (1 \u2014\ngreen color, 2 \u2014 blue, 3 \u2014 dark blue, 4 \u2014 pink). In the second sample there\nexists 4! answers, each of them is considered correct. In the third sample two\nvertices with equal colors are connected. So the correct vertex coloring\ncouldn't be obtained.\n\n",
