        "description": "The winter in Berland lasts n days. For each day we know the forecast for the\naverage air temperature that day. Vasya has a new set of winter tires which\nallows him to drive safely no more than k days at any average air temperature.\nAfter k days of using it (regardless of the temperature of these days) the set\nof winter tires wears down and cannot be used more. It is not necessary that\nthese k days form a continuous segment of days. Before the first winter day\nVasya still uses summer tires. It is possible to drive safely on summer tires\nany number of days when the average air temperature is non-negative. It is\nimpossible to drive on summer tires at days when the average air temperature\nis negative. Vasya can change summer tires to winter tires and vice versa at\nthe beginning of any day. Find the minimum number of times Vasya needs to\nchange summer tires to winter tires and vice versa to drive safely during the\nwinter. At the end of the winter the car can be with any set of tires. Input\nThe first line contains two positive integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264\nn) \u2014 the number of winter days and the number of days winter tires can be\nused. It is allowed to drive on winter tires at any temperature, but no more\nthan k days in total. The second line contains a sequence of n integers t1,\nt2, ..., tn ( - 20 \u2264 ti \u2264 20) \u2014 the average air temperature in the i-th winter\nday. Output Print the minimum number of times Vasya has to change summer tires\nto winter tires and vice versa to drive safely during all winter. If it is\nimpossible, print -1. Examples Input 4 3 -5 20 -3 0 Output 2 Input 4 2 -5 20\n-3 0 Output 4 Input 10 6 2 -5 1 3 0 0 -4 -3 1 0 Output 3 Note In the first\nexample before the first winter day Vasya should change summer tires to winter\ntires, use it for three days, and then change winter tires to summer tires\nbecause he can drive safely with the winter tires for just three days. Thus,\nthe total number of tires' changes equals two. In the second example before\nthe first winter day Vasya should change summer tires to winter tires, and\nthen after the first winter day change winter tires to summer tires. After the\nsecond day it is necessary to change summer tires to winter tires again, and\nafter the third day it is necessary to change winter tires to summer tires.\nThus, the total number of tires' changes equals four.\n\n",
