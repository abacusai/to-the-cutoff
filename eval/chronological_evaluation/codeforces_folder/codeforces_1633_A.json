        "description": "You are given an integer \n    n\n. You have to change the minimum number of\ndigits in it in such a way that the resulting number does not have any leading\nzeroes and is divisible by \n    7\n. If there are multiple ways to do it, print\nany of them. If the given number is already divisible by \n    7\n, leave it\nunchanged. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 990\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow, each\ntest case consists of one line containing one integer \n    n\n (\n    10 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 999\n). Output For each test case, print one integer without any\nleading zeroes \u2014 the result of your changes (i. e. the integer that is\ndivisible by \n    7\n and can be obtained by changing the minimum possible\nnumber of digits in \n    n\n). If there are multiple ways to apply changes,\nprint any resulting number. If the given number is already divisible by\n\n    7\n, just print it. Example Input 3 42 23 377 Output 42 28 777 Note In the\nfirst test case of the example, \n    42\n is already divisible by \n    7\n, so\nthere's no need to change it. In the second test case of the example, there\nare multiple answers \u2014 \n    28\n, \n    21\n or \n    63\n. In the third test case\nof the example, other possible answers are \n    357\n, \n    371\n and \n    378\n.\nNote that you cannot print \n    077\n or \n    77\n.\n\n",
