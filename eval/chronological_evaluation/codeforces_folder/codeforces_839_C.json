        "description": "There are n cities and n - 1 roads in the Seven Kingdoms, each road connects\ntwo cities and we can reach any city from any other by the roads. Theon and\nYara Greyjoy are on a horse in the first city, they are starting traveling\nthrough the roads. But the weather is foggy, so they can\u2019t see where the horse\nbrings them. When the horse reaches a city (including the first one), it goes\nto one of the cities connected to the current city. But it is a strange horse,\nit only goes to cities in which they weren't before. In each such city, the\nhorse goes with equal probabilities and it stops when there are no such\ncities. Let the length of each road be 1. The journey starts in the city 1.\nWhat is the expected length (expected value of length) of their journey? You\ncan read about expected (average) value by the link\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000) \u2014 number of cities. Then n - 1 lines follow.\nThe i-th line of these lines contains two integers ui and vi (1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264 n,\nui \u2260 vi) \u2014 the cities connected by the i-th road. It is guaranteed that one\ncan reach any city from any other by the roads. Output Print a number \u2014 the\nexpected length of their journey. The journey starts in the city 1. Your\nanswer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not\nexceed 10^-6. Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of\nthe jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if .\nExamples Input 4 1 2 1 3 2 4 Output 1.500000000000000 Input 5 1 2 1 3 3 4 2 5\nOutput 2.000000000000000 Note In the first sample, their journey may end in\ncities 3 or 4 with equal probability. The distance to city 3 is 1 and to city\n4 is 2, so the expected length is 1.5. In the second sample, their journey may\nend in city 4 or 5. The distance to the both cities is 2, so the expected\nlength is 2.\n\n",
