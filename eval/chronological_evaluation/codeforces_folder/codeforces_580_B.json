        "description": "Kefa wants to celebrate his first big salary by going to restaurant. However,\nhe needs company. Kefa has n friends, each friend will agree to go to the\nrestaurant if Kefa asks. Each friend is characterized by the amount of money\nhe has and the friendship factor in respect to Kefa. The parrot doesn't want\nany friend to feel poor compared to somebody else in the company (Kefa doesn't\ncount). A friend feels poor if in the company there is someone who has at\nleast d units of money more than he does. Also, Kefa wants the total\nfriendship factor of the members of the company to be maximum. Help him invite\nan optimal company! Input The first line of the input contains two space-\nseparated integers, n and d (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, ) \u2014 the number of Kefa's friends\nand the minimum difference between the amount of money in order to feel poor,\nrespectively. Next n lines contain the descriptions of Kefa's friends, the (i\n+ 1)-th line contains the description of the i-th friend of type mi, si (0 \u2264\nmi, si \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the amount of money and the friendship factor, respectively.\nOutput Print the maximum total friendship factir that can be reached. Examples\nInput 4 5 75 5 0 100 150 20 75 1 Output 100 Input 5 100 0 7 11 32 99 10 46 8\n87 54 Output 111 Note In the first sample test the most profitable strategy is\nto form a company from only the second friend. At all other variants the total\ndegree of friendship will be worse. In the second sample test we can take all\nthe friends.\n\n",
