        "description": "Arkady and Masha want to choose decorations for thier aquarium in Fishdom\ngame. They have n decorations to choose from, each of them has some cost. To\ncomplete a task Arkady and Masha need to choose exactly m decorations from\ngiven, and they want to spend as little money as possible. There is one\ndifficulty: Masha likes some a of the given decorations, Arkady likes some b\nof the given decorations. Some decorations may be liked by both Arkady and\nMasha, or not be liked by both. The friends want to choose such decorations so\nthat each of them likes at least k decorations among the chosen. Help Masha\nand Arkady find the minimum sum of money they need to spend. Input The first\nline contains three integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200000, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n)\n\u2014 the number of decorations, how many decorations the friends should choose,\nhow many decorations each of them should like among the chosen. The second\nline contains n integers c1, c2, ..., cn (1 \u2264 ci \u2264 10^9) \u2014 decorations costs.\nThe third line contains single integer a (1 \u2264 a \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of\ndecorations liked by Masha. The fourth line contains a distinct integers x1,\nx2, ..., xa (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 n) \u2014 the ids of decorations liked by Masha. The next two\nlines describe decorations liked by Arkady in the same format. Output Print\nsingle integer: the minimum sum of money the friends should spend to fulfill\nall constraints. If it is not possible, print -1. Examples Input 4 3 2 3 2 2 1\n2 1 2 2 1 3 Output 7 Input 4 3 2 3 2 2 1 2 1 2 3 4 1 3 Output 6 Input 4 2 2 3\n2 2 1 2 1 2 3 4 1 3 Output -1 Note In the first example the only possible\nvariant to choose 3 decorations having all conditions satisfied is to choose\ndecorations 1, 2, 3. In the second example friends can choose decoration 4\ninstead of decoration 3, because this one is one coin cheaper. In the third\nexample it's not possible to choose 2 decorations in a way that both are liked\nby both Masha and Arkady.\n\n",
