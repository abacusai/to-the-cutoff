        "description": "Limak is a grizzly bear. He is big and dreadful. You were chilling in the\nforest when you suddenly met him. It's very unfortunate for you. He will eat\nall your cookies unless you can demonstrate your mathematical skills. To test\nyou, Limak is going to give you a puzzle to solve. It's a well-known fact that\nLimak, as every bear, owns a set of numbers. You know some information about\nthe set: The elements of the set are distinct positive integers. The number of\nelements in the set is n. The number n is divisible by 5. All elements are\nbetween 1 and b, inclusive: bears don't know numbers greater than b. For each\nr in 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, the set contains exactly elements that give remainder r\nwhen divided by 5. (That is, there are elements divisible by 5, elements of\nthe form 5k + 1, elements of the form 5k + 2, and so on.) Limak smiles\nmysteriously and gives you q hints about his set. The i-th hint is the\nfollowing sentence: \"If you only look at elements that are between 1 and\nupToi, inclusive, you will find exactly quantityi such elements in my set.\" In\na moment Limak will tell you the actual puzzle, but something doesn't seem\nright... That smile was very strange. You start to think about a possible\nreason. Maybe Limak cheated you? Or is he a fair grizzly bear? Given n, b, q\nand hints, check whether Limak can be fair, i.e. there exists at least one set\nsatisfying the given conditions. If it's possible then print \u201dfair\".\nOtherwise, print \u201dunfair\". Input The first line contains three integers n, b\nand q (5 \u2264 n \u2264 b \u2264 10^4, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^4, n divisible by 5) \u2014 the size of the\nset, the upper limit for numbers in the set and the number of hints. The next\nq lines describe the hints. The i-th of them contains two integers upToi and\nquantityi (1 \u2264 upToi \u2264 b, 0 \u2264 quantityi \u2264 n). Output Print \u201dfair\" if there\nexists at least one set that has all the required properties and matches all\nthe given hints. Otherwise, print \u201dunfair\". Examples Input 10 20 1 10 10\nOutput fair Input 10 20 3 15 10 5 0 10 5 Output fair Input 10 20 2 15 3 20 10\nOutput unfair Note In the first example there is only one set satisfying all\nconditions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. In the second example also there\nis only one set satisfying all conditions: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,\n15. Easy to see that there is no set satisfying all conditions from the third\nexample. So Limak lied to you :-(\n\n",
