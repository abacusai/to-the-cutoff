        "description": "Mocha likes arrays, and Serval gave her an array consisting of positive\nintegers as a gift. Mocha thinks that for an array of positive integers\n\n    a\n, it is good iff the greatest common divisor of all the elements in\n\n    a\n is no more than its length. And for an array of at least \n    2\n\npositive integers, it is beautiful iff all of its prefixes whose length is no\nless than \n    2\n are good. For example: \n    [3,6]\n is not good, because\n\n    (3,6)=3\n is greater than its length \n    2\n. \n    [1,2,4]\n is both\ngood and beautiful, because all of its prefixes whose length is no less than\n\n    2\n, which are \n    [1,2]\n and \n    [1,2,4]\n, are both good. \n    [3,6,1]\n\nis good but not beautiful, because \n    [3,6]\n is not good. Now Mocha gives\nyou the gift array \n    a\n of \n    n\n positive integers, and she wants to know\nwhether array \n    a\n could become beautiful by reordering the elements in\n\n    a\n. It is allowed to keep the array \n    a\n unchanged. Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases\n\n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 500\n). The description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the length of array \n    a\n. The second line of\neach test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the elements of array\n\n    a\n. Output For each test case, print Yes if it is possible to reorder the\nelements in \n    a\n to make it beautiful, and print No if not. You can output\nYes and No in any case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be\nrecognized as a positive response). Example Input 6 2 3 6 3 1 2 4 3 3 6 1 3 15\n35 21 4 35 10 35 14 5 1261 227821 143 4171 1941 Output No Yes Yes No Yes Yes\nNote In the first test case, neither \n    [3,6]\n nor \n    [6,3]\n are\nbeautiful, so it's impossible to obtain a beautiful array by reordering the\nelements in \n    a\n. In the second test case, \n    [1,2,4]\n is already\nbeautiful. Keeping the array \n    a\n unchanged can obtain a beautiful array.\n\n",
