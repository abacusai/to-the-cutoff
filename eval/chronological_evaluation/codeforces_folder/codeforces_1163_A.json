        "description": "The three friends, Kuro, Shiro, and Katie, met up again! It's time for a\nparty... What the cats do when they unite? Right, they have a party. Since\nthey wanted to have as much fun as possible, they invited all their friends.\nNow \n    n\n cats are at the party, sitting in a circle and eating soup. The\nrules are simple: anyone having finished their soup leaves the circle. Katie\nsuddenly notices that whenever a cat leaves, the place where she was sitting\nbecomes an empty space, which means the circle is divided into smaller\ncontinuous groups of cats sitting next to each other. At the moment Katie\nobserves, there are \n    m\n cats who left the circle. This raises a question\nfor Katie: what is the maximum possible number of groups the circle is divided\ninto at the moment? Could you help her with this curiosity? You can see the\nexamples and their descriptions with pictures in the \"Note\" section. Input The\nonly line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    1000\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the initial number of cats at the party\nand the number of cats who left the circle at the moment Katie observes,\nrespectively. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of groups of\ncats at the moment Katie observes. Examples Input 7 4 Output 3 Input 6 2\nOutput 2 Input 3 0 Output 1 Input 2 2 Output 0 Note In the first example,\noriginally there are \n    7\n cats sitting as shown below, creating a single\ngroup: At the observed moment, \n    4\n cats have left the table. Suppose the\ncats \n    2\n, \n    3\n, \n    5\n and \n    7\n have left, then there are \n    3\n\ngroups remaining. It is possible to show that it is the maximum possible\nnumber of groups remaining. In the second example, there are \n    6\n cats\nsitting as shown below: At the observed moment, \n    2\n cats have left the\ntable. Suppose the cats numbered \n    3\n and \n    6\n left, then there will be\n\n    2\n groups remaining (\n    1, 2\n and \n    4, 5\n). It\nis impossible to have more than \n    2\n groups of cats remaining. In the third\nexample, no cats have left, so there is \n    1\n group consisting of all cats.\nIn the fourth example, all cats have left the circle, so there are \n    0\n\ngroups.\n\n",
