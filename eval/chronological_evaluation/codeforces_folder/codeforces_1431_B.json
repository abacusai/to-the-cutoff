        "description": "Polycarp has just finished writing down the lecture on elvish languages. The\nlanguage this week was \"VwV\" (pronounced as \"uwu\"). The writing system of this\nlanguage consists of only two lowercase Latin letters: 'v' and 'w'.\nUnfortunately, Polycarp has written all the lecture in cursive and without any\nspaces, so the notes look like a neverending sequence of squiggles. To be\nexact, Polycarp can't tell 'w' apart from 'vv' in his notes as both of them\nconsist of the same two squiggles. Luckily, his brother Monocarp has better\nwriting habits, so Polycarp managed to take his notes and now wants to make\nhis own notes more readable. To do that he can follow the notes of Monocarp\nand underline some letters in his own notes in such a way that there is no\nmore ambiguity. If he underlines a 'v', then it can't be mistaken for a part\nof some 'w', and if the underlines a 'w', then it can't be mistaken for two\nadjacent letters 'v'. What is the minimum number of letters Polycarp should\nunderline to make his notes unambiguous? Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of testcases.\nEach of the next \n    t\n lines contains a non-empty string in VwV language,\nwhich consists only of lowercase Latin letters 'v' and 'w'. The length of the\nstring does not exceed \n    100\n. Output For each testcase print a single\ninteger: the minimum number of letters Polycarp should underline so that there\nis no ambiguity in his notes. Example Input 5 vv v w vwv vwvvwv Output 1 0 1 1\n3 Note In the first testcase it's enough to underline any of the two letters\n'v'. In the second testcase the letter 'v' is not ambiguous by itself already,\nso you don't have to underline anything. In the third testcase you have to\nunderline 'w', so that you don't mix it up with two letters 'v'. In the fourth\ntestcase you can underline 'w' to avoid all the ambiguity. In the fifth\ntestcase you can underline both letters 'w' and any of the two letters 'v'\nbetween them.\n\n",
