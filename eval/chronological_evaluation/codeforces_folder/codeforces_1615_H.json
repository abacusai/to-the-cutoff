        "description": "There are \n    n\n reindeer at the North Pole, all battling for the highest\nspot on the \"Top Reindeer\" leaderboard on the front page of CodeNorses (a\npopular competitive reindeer gaming website). Interestingly, the \"Top\nReindeer\" title is just a measure of upvotes and has nothing to do with their\nskill level in the reindeer games, but they still give it the utmost\nimportance. Currently, the \n    i\n-th reindeer has a score of \n    a_i\n. You\nwould like to influence the leaderboard with some operations. In an operation,\nyou can choose a reindeer, and either increase or decrease his score by\n\n    1\n unit. Negative scores are allowed. You have \n    m\n requirements for\nthe resulting scores. Each requirement is given by an ordered pair \n    (u,\n    v)\n, meaning that after all operations, the score of reindeer \n    u\n must\nbe less than or equal to the score of reindeer \n    v\n. Your task is to\nperform the minimum number of operations so that all requirements will be\nsatisfied. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n\n(\n    2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 1000\n; \n    1\n    \u2264 m\n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of reindeer\nand requirements, respectively. The second line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1,\n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264 10^9\n), where \n    a_i\n is the\ncurrent score of reindeer \n    i\n. The next \n    m\n lines describe the\nrequirements. The \n    i\n-th of these lines contains two integers \n    u_i\n\nand \n    v_i\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 u_i, v_i\n    \u2264 n\n; \n    u_i\n     v_i\n) \u2014 the two\nreindeer of the \n    i\n-th requirement. Output Print \n    n\n integers\n\n    b_1,\n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    -10^15\n    \u2264 b_i\n    \u2264 10^15\n), where\n\n    b_i\n is the score of the \n    i\n-th reindeer after all operations. If\nthere are multiple solutions achieving the minimum number of operations, you\nmay output any. We can prove that there is always an optimal solution such\nthat \n    |b_i|\n    \u2264 10^15\n for all \n    i\n.
