        "description": "Polycarp has spent the entire day preparing problems for you. Now he has to\nsleep for at least \n    a\n minutes to feel refreshed. Polycarp can only wake\nup by hearing the sound of his alarm. So he has just fallen asleep and his\nfirst alarm goes off in \n    b\n minutes. Every time Polycarp wakes up, he\ndecides if he wants to sleep for some more time or not. If he's slept for less\nthan \n    a\n minutes in total, then he sets his alarm to go off in \n    c\n\nminutes after it is reset and spends \n    d\n minutes to fall asleep again.\nOtherwise, he gets out of his bed and proceeds with the day. If the alarm goes\noff while Polycarp is falling asleep, then he resets his alarm to go off in\nanother \n    c\n minutes and tries to fall asleep for \n    d\n minutes again.\nYou just want to find out when will Polycarp get out of his bed or report that\nit will never happen. Please check out the notes for some explanations of the\nexample. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. The only line of each testcase contains\nfour integers \n    a, b, c, d\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b, c, d \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the\ntime Polycarp has to sleep for to feel refreshed, the time before the first\nalarm goes off, the time before every succeeding alarm goes off and the time\nPolycarp spends to fall asleep. Output For each test case print one integer.\nIf Polycarp never gets out of his bed then print -1. Otherwise, print the time\nit takes for Polycarp to get out of his bed.

He only rested for \n    3\n\nminutes out of \n    10\n minutes he needed. So after that he sets his alarm to\ngo off in \n    6\n minutes and spends \n    4\n minutes falling asleep. Thus, he\nrests for \n    2\n more minutes, totaling in \n    3+2=5\n minutes of sleep. Then\nhe repeats the procedure three more times and ends up with \n    11\n minutes of\nsleep. Finally, he gets out of his bed. He spent \n    3\n minutes before the\nfirst alarm and then reset his alarm four times. The answer is \n    3+4 \n    \u00b7\n    6 = 27\n. The second example is almost like the first one but Polycarp needs\n\n    11\n minutes of sleep instead of \n    10\n. However, that changes nothing\nbecause he gets \n    11\n minutes with these alarm parameters anyway. In the\nthird testcase Polycarp wakes up rested enough after the first alarm. Thus,\nthe answer is \n    b=9\n. In the fourth testcase Polycarp wakes up after\n\n    5\n minutes. Unfortunately, he keeps resetting his alarm infinitely being\nunable to rest for even a single minute :(\n\n",
