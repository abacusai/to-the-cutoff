        "description": "There are \n    n\n people sitting in a circle, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n\nin the order in which they are seated. That is, for all \n    i\n from \n    1\n\nto \n    n-1\n, the people with id \n    i\n and \n    i+1\n are adjacent. People\nwith id \n    n\n and \n    1\n are adjacent as well. The person with id \n    1\n\ninitially has a ball. He picks a positive integer \n    k\n at most \n    n\n, and\npasses the ball to his \n    k\n-th neighbour in the direction of increasing\nids, that person passes the ball to his \n    k\n-th neighbour in the same\ndirection, and so on until the person with the id \n    1\n gets the ball back.\nWhen he gets it back, people do not pass the ball any more. For instance, if\n\n    n = 6\n and \n    k = 4\n, the ball is passed in order \n    [1, 5, 3, 1]\n.\nConsider the set of all people that touched the ball. The fun value of the\ngame is the sum of the ids of people that touched it. In the above example,\nthe fun value would be \n    1 + 5 + 3 = 9\n. Find and report the set of\npossible fun values for all choices of positive integer \n    k\n. It can be\nshown that under the constraints of the problem, the ball always gets back to\nthe \n    1\n-st player after finitely many steps, and there are no more than\n\n    10^5\n possible fun values for given \n    n\n. Input The only line consists\nof a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of\npeople playing with the ball. Output Suppose the set of all fun values is\n\n    f_1, f_2, \n    \u2026, f_m\n. Output a single line containing \n    m\n space\nseparated integers \n    f_1\n through \n    f_m\n in increasing order. Examples\nInput 6 Output 1 5 9 21 Input 16 Output 1 10 28 64 136 Note In the first\nsample, we've already shown that picking \n    k = 4\n yields fun value \n    9\n,\nas does \n    k = 2\n. Picking \n    k = 6\n results in fun value of \n    1\n. For\n\n    k = 3\n we get fun value \n    5\n and with \n    k = 1\n or \n    k = 5\n we\nget \n    21\n. In the second sample, the values \n    1\n, \n    10\n, \n    28\n,\n\n    64\n and \n    136\n are achieved for instance for \n    k = 16\n, \n    8\n,\n\n    4\n, \n    10\n and \n    11\n, respectively.\n\n",
