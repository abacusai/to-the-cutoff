        "description": "You are given an undirected graph consisting of \n    n\n vertices and \n    n\n\nedges, where \n    n\n is divisible by \n    6\n. Each edge has a weight, which is\na positive (greater than zero) integer. The graph has the following structure:\nit is split into \n    n/3\n triples of vertices, the first triple\nconsisting of vertices \n    1, 2, 3\n, the second triple consisting of vertices\n\n    4, 5, 6\n, and so on. Every pair of vertices from the same triple is\nconnected by an edge. There are no edges between vertices from different\ntriples. You have to paint the vertices of this graph into two colors, red and\nblue. Each vertex should have exactly one color, there should be exactly\n\n    n/2\n red vertices and \n    n/2\n blue vertices. The\ncoloring is called valid if it meets these constraints. The weight of the\ncoloring is the sum of weights of edges connecting two vertices with different\ncolors. Let \n    W\n be the maximum possible weight of a valid coloring.\nCalculate the number of valid colorings with weight \n    W\n, and print it\nmodulo \n    998244353\n. Input The first line contains one integer \n    n\n\n(\n    6 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    n\n is divisible by \n    6\n). The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    w_1, w_2, \n    \u2026, w_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    w_i \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the weights of the edges. Edge \n    1\n connects vertices\n\n    1\n and \n    2\n, edge \n    2\n connects vertices \n    1\n and \n    3\n, edge\n\n    3\n connects vertices \n    2\n and \n    3\n, edge \n    4\n connects vertices\n\n    4\n and \n    5\n, edge \n    5\n connects vertices \n    4\n and \n    6\n, edge\n\n    6\n connects vertices \n    5\n and \n    6\n, and so on. Output Print one\ninteger \u2014 the number of valid colorings with maximum possible weight, taken\nmodulo \n    998244353\n.
