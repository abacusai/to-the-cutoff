        "description": "Codeforces separates its users into \n    4\n divisions by their rating: For\nDivision 1: \n    1900 \n    \u2264\n    rating\n For Division 2: \n    1600 \n    \u2264\n    rating\n    \u2264 1899\n For Division 3: \n    1400 \n    \u2264\n    rating\n    \u2264 1599\n For Division 4: \n    rating\n    \u2264\n    1399\n Given a \n    rating\n, print in which division the\n\n    rating\n belongs. Input The first line of the input contains an\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. The\ndescription of each test consists of one line containing one integer\n\n    rating\n (\n    -5000 \n    \u2264\n    rating\n    \u2264 5000\n).\nOutput For each test case, output a single line containing the correct\ndivision in the format \"Division X\", where \n    X\n is an integer between\n\n    1\n and \n    4\n representing the division for the corresponding rating.\nExample Input 7 -789 1299 1300 1399 1400 1679 2300 Output Division 4 Division\n4 Division 4 Division 4 Division 3 Division 2 Division 1 Note For test cases\n\n    1-4\n, the corresponding ratings are \n    -789\n, \n    1299\n, \n    1300\n,\n\n    1399\n, so all of them are in division \n    4\n. For the fifth test case,\nthe corresponding rating is \n    1400\n, so it is in division \n    3\n. For the\nsixth test case, the corresponding rating is \n    1679\n, so it is in division\n\n    2\n. For the seventh test case, the corresponding rating is \n    2300\n, so\nit is in division \n    1\n.\n\n",
