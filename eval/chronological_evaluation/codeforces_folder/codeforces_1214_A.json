        "description": "Andrew was very excited to participate in Olympiad of Metropolises. Days flew\nby quickly, and Andrew is already at the airport, ready to go home. He has\n\n    n\n rubles left, and would like to exchange them to euro and dollar bills.\nAndrew can mix dollar bills and euro bills in whatever way he wants. The price\nof one dollar is \n    d\n rubles, and one euro costs \n    e\n rubles. Recall\nthat there exist the following dollar bills: \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    5\n,\n\n    10\n, \n    20\n, \n    50\n, \n    100\n, and the following euro bills \u2014\n\n    5\n, \n    10\n, \n    20\n, \n    50\n, \n    100\n, \n    200\n (note that, in\nthis problem we do not consider the \n    500\n euro bill, it is hard to find\nsuch bills in the currency exchange points). Andrew can buy any combination of\nbills, and his goal is to minimize the total number of rubles he will have\nafter the exchange. Help him \u2014 write a program that given integers \n    n\n,\n\n    e\n and \n    d\n, finds the minimum number of rubles Andrew can get after\nbuying dollar and euro bills. Input The first line of the input contains one\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^8\n) \u2014 the initial sum in rubles\nAndrew has. The second line of the input contains one integer \n    d\n (\n    30\n    \n    \u2264 d \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the price of one dollar in rubles. The third line of\nthe input contains integer \n    e\n (\n    30 \n    \u2264 e \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the price\nof one euro in rubles. Output Output one integer \u2014 the minimum number of\nrubles Andrew can have after buying dollar and euro bills optimally. Examples\nInput 100 60 70 Output 40 Input 410 55 70 Output 5 Input 600 60 70 Output 0\nNote In the first example, we can buy just \n    1\n dollar because there is no\n\n    1\n euro bill. In the second example, optimal exchange is to buy \n    5\n\neuro and \n    1\n dollar. In the third example, optimal exchange is to buy\n\n    10\n dollars in one bill.\n\n",
