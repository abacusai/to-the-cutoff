        "description": "King Kog got annoyed of the usual laxity of his knights \u2014 they can break into\nhis hall without prior notice! Thus, the King decided to build a reception\nwith a queue where each knight chooses in advance the time when he will come\nand how long the visit will take. The knights are served in the order of the\nrecorded time, but each knight has to wait until the visits of all the knights\nbefore him are finished. Princess Keabeanie wants to see her father. However,\nshe does not want to interrupt the knights so she joins the queue.\nUnfortunately, the knights change their minds very often \u2014 they can join the\nqueue or cancel their visits. Please help the princess to understand how long\nshe will have to wait until she sees her father if she enters the queue at the\nspecified moments of time given the records at the reception. Input The first\nline of the input contains a single integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 3\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of events. An event can be of three types: join,\ncancel, or query. Join \"+ \n    t\n \n    d\n\" (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t, d \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014\na new knight joins the queue, where \n    t\n is the time when the knight will\ncome and \n    d\n is the duration of the visit. Cancel \"- \n    i\n\" (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    i \n    \u2264 q\n) \u2014 the knight cancels the visit, where \n    i\n is the number\n(counted starting from one) of the corresponding join event in the list of all\nevents. Query \"? \n    t\n\" (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 Keabeanie asks how\nlong she will wait if she comes at the time \n    t\n. It is guaranteed that\nafter each event there are no two knights with the same entrance time in the\nqueue. Cancel events refer to the previous joins that were not cancelled yet.\nKeabeanie can come at the same time as some knight, but Keabeanie is very\npolite and she will wait for the knight to pass. Output For each query write a\nseparate line with the amount of time Keabeanie will have to wait. Example\nInput 19 ? 3  2 2 ? 3 ? 4  5 2 ? 5 ? 6  1 2 ? 2 ? 3 ? 4 ? 5 ? 6 ? 7 ? 9\n\u00ad 8 ? 2 ? 3 ? 6 Output 0 1 0 2 1 3 2 1 2 1 0 0 2 1 1\n\n",
