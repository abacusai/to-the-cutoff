        "description": "This is an easy version of the problem. The difference between the easy and\nhard versions is that in this version, you can output any permutation with the\nsmallest weight. You are given a permutation \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n of\nintegers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Let's define the weight of the permutation\n\n    q_1, q_2, \n    \u2026, q_n\n of integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n as\n\n    \n\n    |q_1 - p_q_2| + |q_2 - p_q_3| + \n    \u2026 + |q_n-1 - p_q_n|\n    + |q_n - p_q_1|\n\n    \n You want your permutation to be as lightweight as\npossible. Find any permutation \n    q\n with the smallest possible weight.\nInput The first line of the input contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test\ncases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the size of the permutation. The second\nline of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n, all \n    p_i\n are distinct) \u2014 the elements of the\npermutation. The sum of \n    n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed \n    400\n.\nOutput For each test case, output \n    n\n integers \n    q_1, q_2, \n    \u2026,\n    q_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q_i \n    \u2264 n\n, all \n    q_i\n are distinct) \u2014 one of the\npermutations with the smallest weight. Example Input 3 2 2 1 4 2 3 1 4 5 5 4 3\n2 1 Output 1 2 1 3 4 2 1 4 2 3 5 Note In the first test case, there are two\npermutations of length \n    2\n: \n    (1, 2)\n and \n    (2, 1)\n. Permutation\n\n    (1, 2)\n has weight \n    |1 - p_2| + |2 - p_1| = 0\n, and permutation\n\n    (2, 1)\n has the same weight: \n    |2 - p_1| + |1 - p_2| = 0\n. You can\noutput any of these permutations in this version. In the second test case, the\nweight of the permutation \n    (1, 3, 4, 2)\n is \n    |1 - p_3| + |3 - p_4| + |4\n    - p_2| + |2 - p_1| = |1 - 1| + |3 - 4| + |4 - 3| + |2 - 2| = 2\n. There are\nno permutations with smaller weights. In the third test case, the weight of\nthe permutation \n    (1, 4, 2, 3, 5)\n is \n    |1 - p_4| + |4 - p_2| + |2 - p_3|\n    + |3 - p_5| + |5 - p_1| = |1 - 2| + |4 - 4| + |2 - 3| + |3 - 1| + |5 - 5| =\n    4\n. There are no permutations with smaller weights.\n\n",
