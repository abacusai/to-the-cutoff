        "description": "There are \n    n\n football teams in the world. The Main Football Organization\n(MFO) wants to host at most \n    m\n games. MFO wants the \n    i\n-th game to be\nplayed between the teams \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n in one of the \n    k\n\nstadiums. Let \n    s_ij\n be the numbers of games the \n    i\n-th team played\nin the \n    j\n-th stadium. MFO does not want a team to have much more games in\none stadium than in the others. Therefore, for each team \n    i\n, the absolute\ndifference between the maximum and minimum among \n    s_i1, s_i2, \n    \u2026,\n    s_ik\n should not exceed \n    2\n. Each team has \n    w_i\n \u2014 the amount of\nmoney MFO will earn for each game of the \n    i\n-th team. If the \n    i\n-th\nteam plays \n    l\n games, MFO will earn \n    w_i \n    \u00b7 l\n. MFO needs to find\nwhat games in what stadiums they need to host in order to earn as much money\nas possible, not violating the rule they set. However, this problem is too\ncomplicated for MFO. Therefore, they are asking you to help them. Input The\nfirst line contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, \n    k\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 100\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 1\n     000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264\n    1\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of teams, the number of games, and the number of\nstadiums. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    w_1, w_2, \n    \u2026,\n    w_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 w_i \n    \u2264 1\n     000\n) \u2014 the amount of money MFO will\nearn for each game of the \n    i\n-th game. Each of the following \n    m\n lines\ncontains two integers \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264\n    n\n, \n    a_i \n    \u2260 b_i\n) \u2014 the teams that can play the \n    i\n-th game. It\nis guaranteed that each pair of teams can play at most one game. Output For\neach game in the same order, print \n    t_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t_i \n    \u2264 k\n) \u2014\nthe number of the stadium, in which \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n will play the\ngame. If the \n    i\n-th game should not be played, \n    t_i\n should be equal\nto \n    0\n. If there are multiple answers, print any.
