        "description": "BCPC stands for Byteforces Collegiate Programming Contest, and is the most\nfamous competition in Byteforces. BCPC is a team competition. Each team is\ncomposed by a coach and three contestants. Blenda is the coach of the Bit\nState University(BSU), and she is very strict selecting the members of her\nteam. In BSU there are n students numbered from 1 to n. Since all BSU students\nare infinitely smart, the only important parameters for Blenda are their\nreading and writing speed. After a careful measuring, Blenda have found that\nthe i-th student have a reading speed equal to ri (words per minute), and a\nwriting speed of wi (symbols per minute). Since BSU students are very smart,\nthe measured speeds are sometimes very big and Blenda have decided to subtract\nsome constant value c from all the values of reading speed and some value d\nfrom all the values of writing speed. Therefore she considers ri' = ri - c and\nwi' = wi - d. The student i is said to overwhelm the student j if and only if\nri'\u00b7wj' > rj'\u00b7wi'. Blenda doesn\u2019t like fights in teams, so she thinks that a\nteam consisting of three distinct students i, j and k is good if i overwhelms\nj, j overwhelms k, and k overwhelms i. Yes, the relation of overwhelming is\nnot transitive as it often happens in real life. Since Blenda is busy\npreparing a training camp in Codeforces, you are given a task to calculate the\nnumber of different good teams in BSU. Two teams are considered to be\ndifferent if there is at least one student that is present in one team but is\nnot present in the other. In other words, two teams are different if the sets\nof students that form these teams are different. Input In the first line of\nthe input three integers n, c and d (3 \u2264 n \u2264 345678, 1 \u2264 c, d \u2264 10^9) are\nwritten. They denote the number of students Blenda can use to form teams, the\nvalue subtracted from all reading speeds and the value subtracted from all\nwriting speeds respectively. Each of the next n lines contains two integers ri\nand wi (0 < ri, wi \u2264 10^9, |ri - c| + |wi - d| > 0). There are no two\nstudents, such that both their reading and writing speeds coincide, i.e. for\nevery i \u2260 j condition |ri - rj| + |wi - wj| > 0 holds. Output Print the number\nof different teams in BSU, that are good according to Blenda's definition.\nExamples Input 5 2 2 1 1 4 1 2 3 3 2 3 4 Output 4 Input 7 6 6 3 2 1 7 5 7 3 7\n6 4 8 9 8 5 Output 11 Note In the first sample the following teams are good:\n(i = 1, j = 2, k = 3), (i = 2, j = 5, k = 1), (i = 1, j = 4, k = 3), (i = 5, j\n= 1, k = 4). Note, that for example the team (i = 3, j = 1, k = 2) is also\ngood, but is considered to be the same as the team (i = 1, j = 2, k = 3).\n\n",
