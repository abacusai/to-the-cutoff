        "description": "Pak Chanek is participating in a lemper cooking competition. In the\ncompetition, Pak Chanek has to cook lempers with \n    N\n stoves that are\narranged sequentially from stove \n    1\n to stove \n    N\n. Initially, stove\n\n    i\n has a temperature of \n    A_i\n degrees. A stove can have a negative\ntemperature. Pak Chanek realises that, in order for his lempers to be cooked,\nhe needs to keep the temperature of each stove at a non-negative value. To\nmake it happen, Pak Chanek can do zero or more operations. In one operation,\nPak Chanek chooses one stove \n    i\n with \n    2 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 N-1\n, then:\nchanges the temperature of stove \n    i-1\n into \n    A_i-1 := A_i-1 +\n    A_i\n, changes the temperature of stove \n    i+1\n into \n    A_i+1 :=\n    A_i+1 + A_i\n, and changes the temperature of stove \n    i\n into \n    A_i\n    := -A_i\n. Pak Chanek wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs\nto do such that the temperatures of all stoves are at non-negative values.\nHelp Pak Chanek by telling him the minimum number of operations needed or by\nreporting if it is not possible to do. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    N\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of stoves. The\nsecond line contains \n    N\n integers \n    A_1, A_2, \n    \u2026, A_N\n (\n    -10^9\n    \n    \u2264 A_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the initial temperatures of the stoves. Output\nOutput an integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to make\nthe temperatures of all stoves at non-negative values or output \n    -1\n if it\nis not possible. Examples Input 7 2 -1 -1 5 2 -2 9 Output 4 Input 5 -1 -2 -3\n-4 -5 Output -1 Note For the first example, a sequence of operations that can\nbe done is as follows: Pak Chanek does an operation to stove \n    3\n, \n    A =\n    [2, -2, 1, 4, 2, -2, 9]\n. Pak Chanek does an operation to stove \n    2\n,\n\n    A = [0, 2, -1, 4, 2, -2, 9]\n. Pak Chanek does an operation to stove\n\n    3\n, \n    A = [0, 1, 1, 3, 2, -2, 9]\n. Pak Chanek does an operation to\nstove \n    6\n, \n    A = [0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 2, 7]\n. There is no other sequence of\noperations such that the number of operations needed is fewer than \n    4\n.\n\n",
