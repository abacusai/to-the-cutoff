        "description": "You have an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n. For every positive integer\n\n    x\n you are going to perform the following operation during the \n    x\n-th\nsecond: Select some distinct indices \n    i_1, i_2, \n    \u2026, i_k\n which\nare between \n    1\n and \n    n\n inclusive, and add \n    2^x-1\n to each\ncorresponding position of \n    a\n. Formally, \n    a_i_j := a_i_j +\n    2^x-1\n for \n    j = 1, 2, \n    \u2026, k\n. Note that you are allowed to not\nselect any indices at all. You have to make \n    a\n nondecreasing as fast as\npossible. Find the smallest number \n    T\n such that you can make the array\nnondecreasing after at most \n    T\n seconds. Array \n    a\n is nondecreasing if\nand only if \n    a_1\n    \u2264 a_2\n    \u2264\n    \u2026\n    \u2264 a_n\n. You have to\nanswer \n    t\n independent test cases. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\nfirst line of each test case contains single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of array \n    a\n. It is guaranteed that the sum\nof values of \n    n\n over all test cases in the input does not exceed\n\n    10^5\n. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    -10^9\n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264 10^9\n).\nOutput For each test case, print the minimum number of seconds in which you\ncan make \n    a\n nondecreasing. Example Input 3 4 1 7 6 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 2 0 -4\nOutput 2 0 3 Note In the first test case, if you select indices \n    3, 4\n at\nthe \n    1\n-st second and \n    4\n at the \n    2\n-nd second, then \n    a\n will\nbecome \n    [1, 7, 7, 8]\n. There are some other possible ways to make \n    a\n\nnondecreasing in \n    2\n seconds, but you can't do it faster. In the second\ntest case, \n    a\n is already nondecreasing, so answer is \n    0\n. In the\nthird test case, if you do nothing at first \n    2\n seconds and select index\n\n    2\n at the \n    3\n-rd second, \n    a\n will become \n    [0, 0]\n.\n\n",
