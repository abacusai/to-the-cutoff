        "description": "Gildong is now developing a puzzle game. The puzzle consists of \n    n\n\nplatforms numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. The player plays the game as a\ncharacter that can stand on each platform and the goal of the game is to move\nthe character from the \n    1\n-st platform to the \n    n\n-th platform. The\n\n    i\n-th platform is labeled with an integer \n    a_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    n-i\n). When the character is standing on the \n    i\n-th platform, the player\ncan move the character to any of the \n    j\n-th platforms where \n    i+1 \n    \u2264 j\n    \n    \u2264 i+a_i\n. If the character is on the \n    i\n-th platform where\n\n    a_i=0\n and \n    i \n     n\n, the player loses the game. Since Gildong\nthinks the current game is not hard enough, he wants to make it even harder.\nHe wants to change some (possibly zero) labels to \n    0\n so that there\nremains exactly one way to win. He wants to modify the game as little as\npossible, so he's asking you to find the minimum number of platforms that\nshould have their labels changed. Two ways are different if and only if there\nexists a platform the character gets to in one way but not in the other way.\nInput Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the\nnumber of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 500\n). Each test case\ncontains two lines. The first line of each test case consists of an integer\n\n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3000\n) \u2014 the number of platforms of the game.\nThe second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers. The \n    i\n-th\ninteger is \n    a_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n-i\n) \u2014 the integer of the\n\n    i\n-th platform. It is guaranteed that: For each test case, there is at\nleast one way to win initially. The sum of \n    n\n in all test cases doesn't\nexceed \n    3000\n. Output For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the minimum\nnumber of different labels that should be changed to \n    0\n so that there\nremains exactly one way to win. Example Input 3 4 1 1 1 0 5 4 3 2 1 0 9 4 1 4\n2 1 0 2 1 0 Output 0 3 2 Note In the first case, the player can only move to\nthe next platform until they get to the \n    4\n-th platform. Since there is\nalready only one way to win, the answer is zero. In the second case, Gildong\ncan change \n    a_2\n, \n    a_3\n, and \n    a_4\n to \n    0\n so that the game\nbecomes \n    4\n \n    0\n \n    0\n \n    0\n \n    0\n. Now the only way the player\ncan win is to move directly from the \n    1\n-st platform to the \n    5\n-th\nplatform. In the third case, Gildong can change \n    a_2\n and \n    a_8\n to\n\n    0\n, then the only way to win is to move in the following way: \n    1\n \u2013\n\n    3\n \u2013 \n    7\n \u2013 \n    9\n.\n\n",
