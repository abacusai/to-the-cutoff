        "name": "Clique Problem",
        "description": "The clique problem is one of the most well-known NP-complete problems. Under\nsome simplification it can be formulated as follows. Consider an undirected\ngraph G. It is required to find a subset of vertices C of the maximum size\nsuch that any two of them are connected by an edge in graph G. Sounds simple,\ndoesn't it? Nobody yet knows an algorithm that finds a solution to this\nproblem in polynomial time of the size of the graph. However, as with many\nother NP-complete problems, the clique problem is easier if you consider a\nspecific type of a graph. Consider n distinct points on a line. Let the i-th\npoint have the coordinate xi and weight wi. Let's form graph G, whose vertices\nare these points and edges connect exactly the pairs of points (i, j), such\nthat the distance between them is not less than the sum of their weights, or\nmore formally: |xi - xj| \u2265 wi + wj. Find the size of the maximum clique in\nsuch graph. Input The first line contains the integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000) \u2014\nthe number of points. Each of the next n lines contains two numbers xi, wi (0\n\u2264 xi \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 wi \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the coordinate and the weight of a point. All xi\nare different. Output Print a single number \u2014 the number of vertexes in the\nmaximum clique of the given graph. Examples Input 4 2 3 3 1 6 1 0 2 Output 3\nNote If you happen to know how to solve this problem without using the\nspecific properties of the graph formulated in the problem statement, then you\nare able to get a prize of one million dollars! The picture for the sample\ntest.\n\n",
