        "description": "Rumors say that one of Kamal-ol-molk's paintings has been altered. A\nrectangular brush has been moved right and down on the painting. Consider the\npainting as a n \u00d7 m rectangular grid. At the beginning an x \u00d7 y rectangular\nbrush is placed somewhere in the frame, with edges parallel to the frame, (1 \u2264\nx \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 m). Then the brush is moved several times. Each time the brush\nis moved one unit right or down. The brush has been strictly inside the frame\nduring the painting. The brush alters every cell it has covered at some\nmoment. You have found one of the old Kamal-ol-molk's paintings. You want to\nknow if it's possible that it has been altered in described manner. If yes,\nyou also want to know minimum possible area of the brush. Input The first line\nof input contains two integers n and m, (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000), denoting the height\nand width of the painting. The next n lines contain the painting. Each line\nhas m characters. Character 'X' denotes an altered cell, otherwise it's showed\nby '.'. There will be at least one altered cell in the painting. Output Print\nthe minimum area of the brush in a line, if the painting is possibly altered,\notherwise print - 1. Examples Input 4 4 XX.. XX.. XXXX XXXX Output 4 Input 4 4\n.... .XXX .XXX .... Output 2 Input 4 5 XXXX. XXXX. .XX.. .XX.. Output -1\n\n",
