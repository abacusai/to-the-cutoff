        "description": "Facetook is a well known social network website, and it will launch a new\nfeature called Facetook Priority Wall. This feature will sort all posts from\nyour friends according to the priority factor (it will be described). This\npriority factor will be affected by three types of actions: 1\"\u0307X posted on\nY's wall\" (15 points), 2. \"X commented on Y's post\" (10 points), 3. \"X likes\nY's post\" (5 points). X and Y will be two distinct names. And each action will\nincrease the priority factor between X and Y (and vice versa) by the above\nvalue of points (the priority factor between X and Y is the same as the\npriority factor between Y and X). You will be given n actions with the above\nformat (without the action number and the number of points), and you have to\nprint all the distinct names in these actions sorted according to the priority\nfactor with you. Input The first line contains your name. The second line\ncontains an integer n, which is the number of actions (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). Then n\nlines follow, it is guaranteed that each one contains exactly 1 action in the\nformat given above. There is exactly one space between each two words in a\nline, and there are no extra spaces. All the letters are lowercase. All names\nin the input will consist of at least 1 letter and at most 10 small Latin\nletters. Output Print m lines, where m is the number of distinct names in the\ninput (excluding yourself). Each line should contain just 1 name. The names\nshould be sorted according to the priority factor with you in the descending\norder (the highest priority factor should come first). If two or more names\nhave the same priority factor, print them in the alphabetical\n(lexicographical) order. Note, that you should output all the names that are\npresent in the input data (excluding yourself), even if that person has a zero\npriority factor. The lexicographical comparison is performed by the standard\n\"<\" operator in modern programming languages. The line a is lexicographically\nsmaller than the line b, if either a is the prefix of b, or if exists such an\ni (1 \u2264 i \u2264 min(|a|, |b|)), that ai < bi, and for any j (1 \u2264 j < i) aj = bj,\nwhere |a| and |b| stand for the lengths of strings a and b correspondently.\nExamples Input ahmed 3 ahmed posted on fatma's wall fatma commented on ahmed's\npost mona likes ahmed's post Output fatma mona Input aba 1 likes likes\nposted's post Output likes posted\n\n",
