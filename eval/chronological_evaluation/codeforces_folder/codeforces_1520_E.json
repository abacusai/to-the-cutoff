        "description": "You are playing the game \"Arranging The Sheep\". The goal of this game is to\nmake the sheep line up. The level in the game is described by a string of\nlength \n    n\n, consisting of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*'\n(sheep). In one move, you can move any sheep one square to the left or one\nsquare to the right, if the corresponding square exists and is empty. The game\nends as soon as the sheep are lined up, that is, there should be no empty\ncells between any sheep. For example, if \n    n=6\n and the level is described\nby the string \"**.*..\", then the following game scenario is possible: the\nsheep at the \n    4\n position moves to the right, the state of the level:\n\"**..*.\"; the sheep at the \n    2\n position moves to the right, the state of\nthe level: \"*.*.*.\"; the sheep at the \n    1\n position moves to the right, the\nstate of the level: \".**.*.\"; the sheep at the \n    3\n position moves to the\nright, the state of the level: \".*.**.\"; the sheep at the \n    2\n position\nmoves to the right, the state of the level: \"..***.\"; the sheep are lined up\nand the game ends. For a given level, determine the minimum number of moves\nyou need to make to complete the level. Input The first line contains one\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). Then \n    t\n test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^6\n). The second line of each test case contains a string of length\n\n    n\n, consisting of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*' (sheep) \u2014 the\ndescription of the level. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    10^6\n. Output For each test case output the\nminimum number of moves you need to make to complete the level. Example Input\n5 6 **.*.. 5 ***** 3 .*. 3 ... 10 *.*...*.** Output 1 0 0 0 9\n\n",
