        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n integers, and \n    q\n\nqueries to it. \n    i\n-th query is denoted by two integers \n    l_i\n and\n\n    r_i\n. For each query, you have to find any integer that occurs exactly\nonce in the subarray of \n    a\n from index \n    l_i\n to index \n    r_i\n (a\nsubarray is a contiguous subsegment of an array). For example, if \n    a = [1,\n    1, 2, 3, 2, 4]\n, then for query \n    (l_i = 2, r_i = 6)\n the subarray we are\ninterested in is \n    [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]\n, and possible answers are \n    1\n,\n\n    3\n and \n    4\n; for query \n    (l_i = 1, r_i = 2)\n the subarray we are\ninterested in is \n    [1, 1]\n, and there is no such element that occurs\nexactly once. Can you answer all of the queries? Input The first line contains\none integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The second line\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 5\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The third line contains one integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q\n    \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). Then \n    q\n lines follow, \n    i\n-th line\ncontaining two integers \n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n representing \n    i\n-th query\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 n\n). Output Answer the queries as follows:\nIf there is no integer such that it occurs in the subarray from index\n\n    l_i\n to index \n    r_i\n exactly once, print \n    0\n. Otherwise print any\nsuch integer. Example Input 6 1 1 2 3 2 4 2 2 6 1 2 Output 4 0\n\n",
