        "description": "Given an array \n    a\n of \n    n\n elements, print any value that appears at\nleast three times or print -1 if there is no such value. Input The first line\ncontains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b710^5\n) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line of\neach test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the\nsum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output\nFor each test case, print any value that appears at least three times or print\n-1 if there is no such value. Example Input 7 1 1 3 2 2 2 7 2 2 3 3 4 2 2 8 1\n4 3 4 3 2 4 1 9 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 5 1 5 2 4 3 4 4 4 4 4 Output -1 2 2 4 3 -1 4\nNote In the first test case there is just a single element, so it can't occur\nat least three times and the answer is -1. In the second test case, all three\nelements of the array are equal to \n    2\n, so \n    2\n occurs three times, and\nso the answer is \n    2\n. For the third test case, \n    2\n occurs four times,\nso the answer is \n    2\n. For the fourth test case, \n    4\n occurs three\ntimes, so the answer is \n    4\n. For the fifth test case, \n    1\n, \n    2\n and\n\n    3\n all occur at least three times, so they are all valid outputs. For the\nsixth test case, all elements are distinct, so none of them occurs at least\nthree times and the answer is -1.\n\n",
