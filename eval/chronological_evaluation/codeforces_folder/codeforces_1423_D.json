        "name": "Does anyone else hate the wind?",
        "description": "Mark and his crew are sailing across the sea of Aeolus (in Greek mythology\nAeolus was the keeper of the winds). They have the map which represents the\n\n    N\nx\n    M\n matrix with land and sea fields and they want to get to the\nport (the port is considered as sea field). They are in a hurry because the\nwind there is very strong and changeable and they have the food for only\n\n    K\n days on the sea (that is the maximum that they can carry on the ship).\nJohn, the guy from Mark's crew, knows how to predict the direction of the wind\non daily basis for \n    W\n days which is enough time for them to reach the\nport or to run out of the food. Mark can move the ship in four directions\n(north, east, south, west) by one field for one day, but he can also stay in\nthe same place. Wind can blow in four directions (north, east, south, west) or\njust not blow that day. The wind is so strong at the sea of Aeolus that it\nmoves the ship for one whole field in the direction which it blows at. The\nship's resulting movement is the sum of the ship's action and wind from that\nday. Mark must be careful in order to keep the ship on the sea, the resulting\nmovement must end on the sea field and there must be a 4-connected path\nthrough the sea from the starting field. A 4-connected path is a path where\nyou can go from one cell to another only if they share a side. For example in\nthe following image, the ship can't move to the port as there is no\n4-connected path through the sea. In the next image, the ship can move to the\nport as there is a 4-connected path through the sea as shown with the red\narrow. Furthermore, the ship can move to the port in one move if one of the\nfollowing happens. Wind is blowing east and Mark moves the ship north, or wind\nis blowing north and Mark moves the ship east. In either of these scenarios\nthe ship will end up in the port in one move. Mark must also keep the ship on\nthe map because he doesn't know what is outside. Lucky for Mark and his crew,\nthere are \n    T\n fish shops at the sea where they can replenish their food\nsupplies to the maximum, but each shop is working on only one day. That means\nthat Mark and his crew must be at the shop's position on the exact working day\nin order to replenish their food supplies. Help Mark to find the minimum of\ndays that he and his crew need to reach the port or print \n    -1\n if that is\nimpossible with the food supplies that they have. Input First line contains\ntwo integer numbers \n    N\n and \n    M\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 N, M \n    \u2264 200\n) -\nrepresenting the number of rows and number of columns of the map. Second line\ncontains three integers, \n    K\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 K \n    \u2264 200\n) which is the\nnumber of days with the available food supplies, \n    T\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264\n    20\n) which is the number of fields with additional food supplies and \n    W\n\n(\n    0 \n    \u2264 W \n    \u2264 10^6\n) which is the number of days with wind\ninformation. Next is the \n    N\nx\n    M\n char matrix filled with the values of\n'L', 'S', 'P' or 'M'. 'L' is for the land and 'S' is for the sea parts. 'P' is\nfor the port field and 'M' is the starting field for the ship. Next line\ncontains \n    W\n chars with the wind direction information for every day. The\npossible inputs are 'N' - north, 'S' - south, 'E' - east, 'W' - west and 'C' -\nno wind. If Mark's crew can reach the port, it is guaranteed that they will\nnot need more than \n    W\n days to reach it. In the end there are \n    T\n\nlines with the food supplies positions. Each line contains three integers,\n\n    Y_i\n and \n    X_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 Y_i < N, 0 \n    \u2264 X_i < M\n)\nrepresenting the coordinates (Y is row number and X is column number) of the\nfood supply and \n    F_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 F_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n) representing the\nnumber of days from the starting day on which the food supply is available.\nOutput One integer number representing the minimal days to reach the port or\n\n    -1\n if that is impossible.
