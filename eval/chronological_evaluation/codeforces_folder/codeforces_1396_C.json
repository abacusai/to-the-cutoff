        "description": "Ziota found a video game called \"Monster Invaders\". Similar to every other\nshooting RPG game, \"Monster Invaders\" involves killing monsters and bosses\nwith guns. For the sake of simplicity, we only consider two different types of\nmonsters and three different types of guns. Namely, the two types of monsters\nare: a normal monster with \n    1\n hp. a boss with \n    2\n hp. And the three\ntypes of guns are: Pistol, deals \n    1\n hp in damage to one monster,\n\n    r_1\n reloading time Laser gun, deals \n    1\n hp in damage to all the\nmonsters in the current level (including the boss), \n    r_2\n reloading time\nAWP, instantly kills any monster, \n    r_3\n reloading time The guns are\ninitially not loaded, and the Ziota can only reload 1 gun at a time. The\nlevels of the game can be considered as an array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n, in which the \n    i\n-th stage has \n    a_i\n normal monsters and 1\nboss. Due to the nature of the game, Ziota cannot use the Pistol (the first\ntype of gun) or AWP (the third type of gun) to shoot the boss before killing\nall of the \n    a_i\n normal monsters. If Ziota damages the boss but does not\nkill it immediately, he is forced to move out of the current level to an\narbitrary adjacent level (adjacent levels of level \n    i\n \n    (1 < i < n)\n\nare levels \n    i - 1\n and \n    i + 1\n, the only adjacent level of level\n\n    1\n is level \n    2\n, the only adjacent level of level \n    n\n is level\n\n    n - 1\n). Ziota can also choose to move to an adjacent level at any time.\nEach move between adjacent levels are managed by portals with \n    d\n\nteleportation time. In order not to disrupt the space-time continuum within\nthe game, it is strictly forbidden to reload or shoot monsters during\nteleportation. Ziota starts the game at level 1. The objective of the game is\nrather simple, to kill all the bosses in all the levels. He is curious about\nthe minimum time to finish the game (assuming it takes no time to shoot the\nmonsters with a loaded gun and Ziota has infinite ammo on all the three guns).\nPlease help him find this value. Input The first line of the input contains\nfive integers separated by single spaces: \n    n\n \n    (2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6)\n\n\u2014 the number of stages, \n    r_1, r_2, r_3\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 r_1 \n    \u2264 r_2 \n    \u2264\n    r_3 \n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 the reload time of the three guns respectively, \n    d\n\n\n    (1 \n    \u2264 d \n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 the time of moving between adjacent levels. The\nsecond line of the input contains \n    n\n integers separated by single spaces\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^6, 1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    n)\n. Output Print one integer, the minimum time to finish the game. Examples\nInput 4 1 3 4 3 3 2 5 1 Output 34 Input 4 2 4 4 1 4 5 1 2 Output 31 Note In\nthe first test case, the optimal strategy is: Use the pistol to kill three\nnormal monsters and AWP to kill the boss (Total time \n    1\n    \u00b73+4=7\n) Move\nto stage two (Total time \n    7+3=10\n) Use the pistol twice and AWP to kill\nthe boss (Total time \n    10+1\n    \u00b72+4=16\n) Move to stage three (Total time\n\n    16+3=19\n) Use the laser gun and forced to move to either stage four or\ntwo, here we move to stage four (Total time \n    19+3+3=25\n) Use the pistol\nonce, use AWP to kill the boss (Total time \n    25+1\n    \u00b71+4=30\n) Move back\nto stage three (Total time \n    30+3=33\n) Kill the boss at stage three with\nthe pistol (Total time \n    33+1=34\n) Note that here, we do not finish at\nlevel \n    n\n, but when all the bosses are killed.\n\n",
