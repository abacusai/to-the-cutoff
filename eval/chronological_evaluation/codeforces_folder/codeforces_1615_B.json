        "description": "You are given an array consisting of all integers from \n    [l, r]\n inclusive.\nFor example, if \n    l = 2\n and \n    r = 5\n, the array would be \n    [2, 3, 4,\n    5]\n. What's the minimum number of elements you can delete to make the\nbitwise AND of the array non-zero? A bitwise AND is a binary operation that\ntakes two equal-length binary representations and performs the AND operation\non each pair of the corresponding bits. Input The first line contains one\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThen \n    t\n cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two\nintegers \n    l\n and \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n)\n\u2014 the description of the array. Output For each test case, output a single\ninteger \u2014 the answer to the problem. Example Input 5 1 2 2 8 4 5 1 5 100000\n200000 Output 1 3 0 2 31072 Note In the first test case, the array is \n    [1,\n    2]\n. Currently, the bitwise AND is \n    0\n, as \n    1\n     \n    &\n     2 = 0\n.\nHowever, after deleting \n    1\n (or \n    2\n), the array becomes \n    [2]\n (or\n\n    [1]\n), and the bitwise AND becomes \n    2\n (or \n    1\n). This can be\nproven to be the optimal, so the answer is \n    1\n. In the second test case,\nthe array is \n    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n. Currently, the bitwise AND is\n\n    0\n. However, after deleting \n    4\n, \n    5\n, and \n    8\n, the array\nbecomes \n    [2, 3, 6, 7]\n, and the bitwise AND becomes \n    2\n. This can be\nproven to be the optimal, so the answer is \n    3\n. Note that there may be\nother ways to delete \n    3\n elements.\n\n",
