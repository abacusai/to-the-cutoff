        "description": "There is a given string S consisting of N symbols. Your task is to find the\nnumber of ordered pairs of integers i and j such that 11\u0307 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N 2\u1e60[i] = S[j], that is the i-th symbol of string S is equal to the j-th. Input\nThe single input line contains S, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and\ndigits. It is guaranteed that string S in not empty and its length does not\nexceed 10^5. Output Print a single number which represents the number of pairs\ni and j with the needed property. Pairs (x, y) and (y, x) should be considered\ndifferent, i.e. the ordered pairs count. Examples Input great10 Output 7 Input\naaaaaaaaaa Output 100\n\n",
