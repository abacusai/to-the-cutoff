        "description": "Burenka and Tonya are playing an old Buryat game with a chip on a board of\n\n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n cells. At the beginning of the game, the chip is located in\nthe lower left corner of the board. In one move, the player can move the chip\nto the right or up by any odd number of cells (but you cannot move the chip\nboth to the right and up in one move). The one who cannot make a move loses.\nBurenka makes the first move, the players take turns. Burenka really wants to\nwin the game, but she is too lazy to come up with a strategy, so you are\ninvited to solve the difficult task of finding it. Name the winner of the game\n(it is believed that Burenka and Tonya are masters of playing with chips, so\nthey always move in the optimal way). Chip's starting cell is green, the only\ncell from which chip can't move is red. if the chip is in the yellow cell,\nthen blue cells are all options to move the chip in one move. Input The first\nline contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases. The following is a description of the input data sets. The only\nline of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    n, m \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the dimensions of the game board. Output For each test\ncase print a single line \u2014 the name of the winner of the game (\"Burenka\" or\n\"Tonya\"). Example Input 6 1 1 1 4 5 6 2 2 6 3 999999999 1000000000 Output\nTonya Burenka Burenka Tonya Burenka Burenka Note In the first case, Burenka\nhas no move, so Tonya wins. In the second case, Burenka can move \n    3\n cells\nto the right, after which Tony will not be able to make a move, which means\nthat Burenka wins. In the third case, Burenka can move \n    5\n squares to the\nright. Then we can say that we have a game on a board of \n    1 \n    \u00d7 5\n\ncells, and Tonya is the first player. In such game the second player wins, so\nin the original one Burenka will win.\n\n",
