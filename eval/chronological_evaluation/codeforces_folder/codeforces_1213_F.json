        "description": "Authors have come up with the string \n    s\n consisting of \n    n\n lowercase\nLatin letters. You are given two permutations of its indices (not necessary\nequal) \n    p\n and \n    q\n (both of length \n    n\n). Recall that the\npermutation is the array of length \n    n\n which contains each integer from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n exactly once. For all \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n-1\n the\nfollowing properties hold: \n    s[p_i] \n    \u2264 s[p_i + 1]\n and \n    s[q_i] \n    \u2264\n    s[q_i + 1]\n. It means that if you will write down all characters of\n\n    s\n in order of permutation indices, the resulting string will be sorted\nin the non-decreasing order. Your task is to restore any such string \n    s\n\nof length \n    n\n consisting of at least \n    k\n distinct lowercase Latin\nletters which suits the given permutations. If there are multiple answers, you\ncan print any of them. Input The first line of the input contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5, 1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 26\n)\n\u2014 the length of the string and the number of distinct characters required. The\nsecond line of the input contains \n    n\n integers \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026,\n    p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n, all \n    p_i\n are distinct integers from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n) \u2014 the permutation \n    p\n. The third line of the input\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    q_1, q_2, \n    \u2026, q_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q_i \n    \u2264\n    n\n, all \n    q_i\n are distinct integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n) \u2014 the\npermutation \n    q\n. Output If it is impossible to find the suitable string,\nprint \"NO\" on the first line. Otherwise print \"YES\" on the first line and\nstring \n    s\n on the second line. It should consist of \n    n\n lowercase\nLatin letters, contain at least \n    k\n distinct characters and suit the given\npermutations. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.\nExample Input 3 2 1 2 3 1 3 2 Output YES abb\n\n",
