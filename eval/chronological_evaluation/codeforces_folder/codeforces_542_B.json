        "description": "A duck hunter is doing his favorite thing, hunting. He lives in a two\ndimensional world and is located at point (0, 0). As he doesn't like walking\nfor his prey, he prefers to shoot only vertically up (because in this case,\nthe ducks fall straight into his hands). The hunter doesn't reload the gun\nimmediately \u2014 r or more seconds must pass between the shots. When the hunter\nshoots up, the bullet immediately hits all the ducks who are directly above\nthe hunter. In a two dimensional world each duck is a horizontal segment that\nmoves horizontally in the negative direction of the Ox axis at the speed 1\nlength unit per second. For each duck we know the values hi and ti \u2014 the\nx-coordinates of its head (the left end of the segment) and its tail (the\nright end of the segment) at time 0. The height where the duck is flying isn't\nimportant as the gun shoots vertically up to the infinite height and hits all\nthe ducks on its way. The figure to the first sample. What maximum number of\nducks can the hunter shoot? The duck is considered shot by the hunter if at\nthe moment of the shot at least one of its point intersects the Oy axis. After\nthe hunter shoots the duck, it falls and it can't be shot anymore. The hunter\ncannot make shots before the moment of time 0. Input The first line of the\ninput contains integers n, r (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, 1 \u2264 r \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of\nducks and the minimum time in seconds between the shots. Then n lines follow,\neach of them contains two integers hi, ti ( - 10^9 \u2264 hi < ti \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the\nx-coordinate of the head and tail of the i-th duck at the moment 0. Output\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of ducks that can be shot by the\nhunter. Examples Input 3 3 -3 0 1 3 -1 2 Output 3 Input 4 5 -1 1 2 4 5 9 6 8\nOutput 3 Note In the first sample the hunter must shoot at time 0, this shot\nkills ducks 1 and 3. Then the hunter needs to reload the gun and shoot again\nat time 3. His second shot hits the tail of duck 2. In the second sample the\nhunter can make shots at times 0 and 6 to hit three ducks.\n\n",
