        "description": "Oleg came to see the maze of mirrors. The maze is a \n    n\n by \n    n\n room in\nwhich each cell is either empty or contains a mirror connecting opposite\ncorners of this cell. Mirrors in this maze reflect light in a perfect way,\nwhich causes the interesting visual effects and contributes to the loss of\norientation in the maze. Oleg is a person of curious nature, so he decided to\ninstall \n    n\n lasers facing internal of the maze on the south wall of the\nmaze. On the north wall of the maze, Oleg installed \n    n\n receivers, also\nfacing internal of the maze. Let's number lasers and receivers from west to\neast with distinct integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Each laser sends a beam\nof some specific kind and receiver with number \n    a_i\n should receive the\nbeam sent from laser number \n    i\n. Since two lasers' beams can't come to the\nsame receiver, these numbers form a permutation \u2014 each of the receiver numbers\noccurs exactly once. You came to the maze together with Oleg. Help him to\nplace the mirrors in the initially empty maze so that the maximum number of\nlasers' beams will come to the receivers they should. There are no mirrors\noutside the maze, so if the laser beam leaves the maze, it will not be able to\ngo back. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the size of the maze. The second line contains a permutation\nof \n    n\n integers \n    a_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n), where \n    a_i\n\ndefines the number of the receiver, to which the beam from \n    i\n-th laser\nshould come. Output In the first line print the maximum possible number of\nlaser beams, which can come to the receivers they should. In the next \n    n\n\nlines of length \n    n\n print the arrangement of mirrors, causing such number\nof laser beams to come where they should. If the corresponding cell is empty,\nprint \".\", otherwise print \"/\" or \"\n,\u0308 depending on the orientation of the\nmirror. In your output north should be above, south should be below, and west\nand east should be on left and on the right respectively. It is allowed for\nlaser beams to come not to the receivers they correspond to, but they are not\ncounted in the answer. If there are multiple arrangements of mirrors leading\nto the optimal answer \u2014 print any of them. Example Input 4 4 1 3 2 Output 3\n.\n\n.. \n\n\n\n.. /../ ...\n Note The picture illustrates the arrangements\nof the mirrors in the first example.\n\n",
