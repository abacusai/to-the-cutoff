        "description": "Jeff has become friends with Furik. Now these two are going to play one quite\namusing game. At the beginning of the game Jeff takes a piece of paper and\nwrites down a permutation consisting of n numbers: p1, p2, ..., pn. Then the\nguys take turns to make moves, Jeff moves first. During his move, Jeff chooses\ntwo adjacent permutation elements and then the boy swaps them. During his\nmove, Furic tosses a coin and if the coin shows \"heads\" he chooses a random\npair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which an inequality pi\n> pi + 1 holds, and swaps them. But if the coin shows \"tails\", Furik chooses a\nrandom pair of adjacent elements with indexes i and i + 1, for which the\ninequality pi < pi + 1 holds, and swaps them. If the coin shows \"heads\" or\n\"tails\" and Furik has multiple ways of adjacent pairs to take, then he\nuniformly takes one of the pairs. If Furik doesn't have any pair to take, he\ntosses a coin one more time. The game ends when the permutation is sorted in\nthe increasing order. Jeff wants the game to finish as quickly as possible\n(that is, he wants both players to make as few moves as possible). Help Jeff\nfind the minimum mathematical expectation of the number of moves in the game\nif he moves optimally well. You can consider that the coin shows the heads (or\ntails) with the probability of 50 percent. Input The first line contains\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3000). The next line contains n distinct integers p1, p2,\n..., pn (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 n) \u2014 the permutation p. The numbers are separated by spaces.\nOutput In a single line print a single real value \u2014 the answer to the problem.\nThe answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error\ndoesn't exceed 10^-6. Examples Input 2 1 2 Output 0.000000 Input 5 3 5 2 4 1\nOutput 13.000000 Note In the first test the sequence is already sorted, so the\nanswer is 0.\n\n",
