        "name": "Two Rabbits",
        "description": "Being tired of participating in too many Codeforces rounds, Gildong decided to\ntake some rest in a park. He sat down on a bench, and soon he found two\nrabbits hopping around. One of the rabbits was taller than the other. He\nnoticed that the two rabbits were hopping towards each other. The positions of\nthe two rabbits can be represented as integer coordinates on a horizontal\nline. The taller rabbit is currently on position \n    x\n, and the shorter\nrabbit is currently on position \n    y\n (\n    x \n     y\n). Every second, each\nrabbit hops to another position. The taller rabbit hops to the positive\ndirection by \n    a\n, and the shorter rabbit hops to the negative direction by\n\n    b\n. For example, let's say \n    x=0\n, \n    y=10\n, \n    a=2\n, and\n\n    b=3\n. At the \n    1\n-st second, each rabbit will be at position \n    2\n\nand \n    7\n. At the \n    2\n-nd second, both rabbits will be at position\n\n    4\n. Gildong is now wondering: Will the two rabbits be at the same\nposition at the same moment? If so, how long will it take? Let's find a moment\nin time (in seconds) after which the rabbits will be at the same point. Input\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number\nof test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n). Each test case contains\nexactly one line. The line consists of four integers \n    x\n, \n    y\n,\n\n    a\n, \n    b\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x \n     y \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 a,b \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) \u2014 the current position of the taller rabbit, the current position of\nthe shorter rabbit, the hopping distance of the taller rabbit, and the hopping\ndistance of the shorter rabbit, respectively. Output For each test case, print\nthe single integer: number of seconds the two rabbits will take to be at the\nsame position. If the two rabbits will never be at the same position\nsimultaneously, print \n    -1\n. Example Input 5 0 10 2 3 0 10 3 3 900000000\n1000000000 1 9999999 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 1 Output 2 -1 10 -1 1 Note The first case\nis explained in the description. In the second case, each rabbit will be at\nposition \n    3\n and \n    7\n respectively at the \n    1\n-st second. But in the\n\n    2\n-nd second they will be at \n    6\n and \n    4\n respectively, and we can\nsee that they will never be at the same position since the distance between\nthe two rabbits will only increase afterward.\n\n",
