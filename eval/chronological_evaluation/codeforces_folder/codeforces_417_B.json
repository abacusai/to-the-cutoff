        "description": "During the \"Russian Code Cup\" programming competition, the testing system\nstores all sent solutions for each participant. We know that many participants\nuse random numbers in their programs and are often sent several solutions with\nthe same source code to check. Each participant is identified by some unique\npositive integer k, and each sent solution A is characterized by two numbers:\nx \u2014 the number of different solutions that are sent before the first solution\nidentical to A, and k \u2014 the number of the participant, who is the author of\nthe solution. Consequently, all identical solutions have the same x. It is\nknown that the data in the testing system are stored in the chronological\norder, that is, if the testing system has a solution with number x (x > 0) of\nthe participant with number k, then the testing system has a solution with\nnumber x - 1 of the same participant stored somewhere before. During the\ncompetition the checking system crashed, but then the data of the submissions\nof all participants have been restored. Now the jury wants to verify that the\nrecovered data is in chronological order. Help the jury to do so. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of\nsolutions. Each of the following n lines contains two integers separated by\nspace x and k (0 \u2264 x \u2264 10^5; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of previous unique\nsolutions and the identifier of the participant. Output A single line of the\noutput should contain \u00abYES\u00bb if the data is in chronological order, and \u00abNO\u00bb\notherwise. Examples Input 2 0 1 1 1 Output YES Input 4 0 1 1 2 1 1 0 2 Output\nNO Input 4 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 2 Output YES\n\n",
