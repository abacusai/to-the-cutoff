        "name": "Kana and Dragon Quest game",
        "description": "Kana was just an ordinary high school girl before a talent scout discovered\nher. Then, she became an idol. But different from the stereotype, she is also\na gameholic. One day Kana gets interested in a new adventure game called\nDragon Quest. In this game, her quest is to beat a dragon. The dragon has a\nhit point of \n    x\n initially. When its hit point goes to \n    0\n or under\n\n    0\n, it will be defeated. In order to defeat the dragon, Kana can cast the\ntwo following types of spells. Void Absorption Assume that the dragon's\ncurrent hit point is \n    h\n, after casting this spell its hit point will\nbecome \n    \u230a\n    h/2\n    \n    \u230b + 10\n. Here\n\n    \u230a\n    h/2\n    \n    \u230b\n denotes \n    h\n divided\nby two, rounded down. Lightning Strike This spell will decrease the dragon's\nhit point by \n    10\n. Assume that the dragon's current hit point is \n    h\n,\nafter casting this spell its hit point will be lowered to \n    h-10\n. Due to\nsome reasons Kana can only cast no more than \n    n\n Void Absorptions and\n\n    m\n Lightning Strikes. She can cast the spells in any order and doesn't\nhave to cast all the spells. Kana isn't good at math, so you are going to help\nher to find out whether it is possible to defeat the dragon. Input The first\nline contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. The next \n    t\n lines describe test cases. For each\ntest case the only line contains three integers \n    x\n, \n    n\n, \n    m\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    0\n    \u2264 n,m\n    \u226430\n) \u2014 the dragon's intitial\nhit point, the maximum number of Void Absorptions and Lightning Strikes Kana\ncan cast respectively. Output If it is possible to defeat the dragon, print\n\"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes). You can print\neach letter in any case (upper or lower). Example Input 7 100 3 4 189 3 4 64 2\n3 63 2 3 30 27 7 10 9 1 69117 21 2 Output YES NO NO YES YES YES YES Note One\npossible casting sequence of the first test case is shown below: Void\nAbsorption \n    \u230a\n    100/2\n    \n    \u230b + 10=60\n.\nLightning Strike \n    60-10=50\n. Void Absorption \n    \u230a\n    50/2\n    \n    \u230b + 10=35\n. Void Absorption\n\n    \u230a\n    35/2\n    \n    \u230b + 10=27\n. Lightning\nStrike \n    27-10=17\n. Lightning Strike \n    17-10=7\n. Lightning Strike\n\n    7-10=-3\n.\n\n",
