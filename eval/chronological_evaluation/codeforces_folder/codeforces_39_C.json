        "name": "Moon Craters",
        "description": "There are lots of theories concerning the origin of moon craters. Most\nscientists stick to the meteorite theory, which says that the craters were\nformed as a result of celestial bodies colliding with the Moon. The other\nversion is that the craters were parts of volcanoes. An extraterrestrial\nintelligence research specialist professor Okulov (the namesake of the Okulov,\nthe author of famous textbooks on programming) put forward an alternate\nhypothesis. Guess what kind of a hypothesis it was \u2013\u2013 sure, the one including\nextraterrestrial mind involvement. Now the professor is looking for proofs of\nhis hypothesis. Professor has data from the moon robot that moves linearly in\none direction along the Moon surface. The moon craters are circular in form\nwith integer-valued radii. The moon robot records only the craters whose\ncenters lay on his path and sends to the Earth the information on the distance\nfrom the centers of the craters to the initial point of its path and on the\nradii of the craters. According to the theory of professor Okulov two craters\nmade by an extraterrestrial intelligence for the aims yet unknown either are\nfully enclosed one in the other or do not intersect at all. Internal or\nexternal tangency is acceptable. However the experimental data from the moon\nrobot do not confirm this theory! Nevertheless, professor Okulov is hopeful.\nHe perfectly understands that to create any logical theory one has to ignore\nsome data that are wrong due to faulty measuring (or skillful disguise by the\nextraterrestrial intelligence that will be sooner or later found by professor\nOkulov!) That\u2019s why Okulov wants to choose among the available crater\ndescriptions the largest set that would satisfy his theory. Input The first\nline has an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of discovered craters. The\nnext n lines contain crater descriptions in the \"ci ri\" format, where ci is\nthe coordinate of the center of the crater on the moon robot\u2019s path, ri is the\nradius of the crater. All the numbers ci and ri are positive integers not\nexceeding 10^9. No two craters coincide. Output In the first line output the\nnumber of craters in the required largest set. In the next line output space-\nseparated numbers of craters that this set consists of. The craters are\nnumbered from 1 to n in the order in which they were given in the input data.\nThe numbers may be output in any order. If the result is not unique, output\nany. Examples Input 4 1 1 2 2 4 1 5 1 Output 3 1 2 4\n\n",
