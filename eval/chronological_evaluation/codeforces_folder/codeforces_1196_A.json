        "name": "Three Piles of Candies",
        "description": "Alice and Bob have received three big piles of candies as a gift. Now they\nwant to divide these candies as fair as possible. To do this, Alice takes one\npile of candies, then Bob takes one of the other two piles. The last pile is\nsplit between Alice and Bob as they want: for example, it is possible that\nAlice takes the whole pile, and Bob gets nothing from it. After taking the\ncandies from the piles, if Alice has more candies than Bob, she discards some\ncandies so that the number of candies she has is equal to the number of\ncandies Bob has. Of course, Bob does the same if he has more candies. Alice\nand Bob want to have as many candies as possible, and they plan the process of\ndividing candies accordingly. Please calculate the maximum number of candies\nAlice can have after this division process (of course, Bob will have the same\nnumber of candies). You have to answer \n    q\n independent queries. Let's see\nthe following example: \n    [1, 3, 4]\n. Then Alice can choose the third pile,\nBob can take the second pile, and then the only candy from the first pile goes\nto Bob \u2014 then Alice has \n    4\n candies, and Bob has \n    4\n candies. Another\nexample is \n    [1, 10, 100]\n. Then Alice can choose the second pile, Bob can\nchoose the first pile, and candies from the third pile can be divided in such\na way that Bob takes \n    54\n candies, and Alice takes \n    46\n candies. Now\nBob has \n    55\n candies, and Alice has \n    56\n candies, so she has to\ndiscard one candy \u2014 and after that, she has \n    55\n candies too. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains one integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of queries. Then \n    q\n queries follow. The only line\nof the query contains three integers \n    a, b\n and \n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b,\n    c \n    \u2264 10^16\n) \u2014 the number of candies in the first, second and third\npiles correspondingly. Output Print \n    q\n lines. The \n    i\n-th line should\ncontain the answer for the \n    i\n-th query \u2014 the maximum number of candies\nAlice can have after the division, if both Alice and Bob act optimally (of\ncourse, Bob will have the same number of candies). Example Input 4 1 3 4 1 10\n100 10000000000000000 10000000000000000 10000000000000000 23 34 45 Output 4 55\n15000000000000000 51\n\n",
