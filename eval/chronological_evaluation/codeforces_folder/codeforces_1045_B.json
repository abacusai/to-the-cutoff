        "description": "Everybody seems to think that the Martians are green, but it turns out they\nare metallic pink and fat. Ajs has two bags of distinct nonnegative integers.\nThe bags are disjoint, and the union of the sets of numbers in the bags is\n\n    0,1,\u2026,M-1\n, for some positive integer \n    M\n. Ajs draws a\nnumber from the first bag and a number from the second bag, and then sums them\nmodulo \n    M\n. What are the residues modulo \n    M\n that Ajs cannot obtain\nwith this action? Input The first line contains two positive integer \n    N\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 200\n     000\n) and \n    M\n (\n    N+1 \n    \u2264 M \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n), denoting the number of the elements in the first bag and the\nmodulus, respectively. The second line contains \n    N\n nonnegative integers\n\n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_N\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_1<a_2< \n    \u2026< a_N<M\n), the\ncontents of the first bag. Output In the first line, output the cardinality\n\n    K\n of the set of residues modulo \n    M\n which Ajs cannot obtain. In the\nsecond line of the output, print \n    K\n space-separated integers greater or\nequal than zero and less than \n    M\n, which represent the residues Ajs cannot\nobtain. The outputs should be sorted in increasing order of magnitude. If\n\n    K\n=0, do not output the second line. Examples Input 2 5 3 4 Output 1 2\nInput 4 1000000000 5 25 125 625 Output 0 Input 2 4 1 3 Output 2 0 2 Note In\nthe first sample, the first bag and the second bag contain \n    3,4\n\nand \n    0,1,2\n, respectively. Ajs can obtain every residue modulo\n\n    5\n except the residue \n    2\n: \n    4+1 \n    \u2261 0, \n      4+2 \n    \u2261 1,\n    \n      3+0 \n    \u2261 3, \n      3+1 \n    \u2261 4\n modulo \n    5\n. One can check\nthat there is no choice of elements from the first and the second bag which\nsum to \n    2\n modulo \n    5\n. In the second sample, the contents of the first\nbag are \n    5,25,125,625\n, while the second bag contains all other\nnonnegative integers with at most \n    9\n decimal digits. Every residue modulo\n\n    1\n     000\n     000\n     000\n can be obtained as a sum of an element in the\nfirst bag and an element in the second bag.\n\n",
