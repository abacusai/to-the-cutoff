        "description": "There are \n    n\n cities in Berland and some pairs of them are connected by\ntwo-way roads. It is guaranteed that you can pass from any city to any other,\nmoving along the roads. Cities are numerated from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Two\nfairs are currently taking place in Berland \u2014 they are held in two different\ncities \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    a \n     b\n). Find\nthe number of pairs of cities \n    x\n and \n    y\n (\n    x \n     a, x \n     b, y\n    \n     a, y \n     b\n) such that if you go from \n    x\n to \n    y\n you will\nhave to go through both fairs (the order of visits doesn't matter). Formally,\nyou need to find the number of pairs of cities \n    x,y\n such that any path\nfrom \n    x\n to \n    y\n goes through \n    a\n and \n    b\n (in any order). Print\nthe required number of pairs. The order of two cities in a pair does not\nmatter, that is, the pairs \n    (x,y)\n and \n    (y,x)\n must be taken into\naccount only once. Input The first line of the input contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 4\n    \u00b710^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the\ninput. Next, \n    t\n test cases are specified. The first line of each test\ncase contains four integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    4 \n    \u2264\n    n \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b710^5\n, \n    n - 1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 5\n    \u00b710^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    a,b \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    a \n     b\n) \u2014 numbers of cities and roads in Berland and\nnumbers of two cities where fairs are held, respectively. The following\n\n    m\n lines contain descriptions of roads between cities. Each of road\ndescription contains a pair of integers \n    u_i, v_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i\n    \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    u_i \n     v_i\n) \u2014 numbers of cities connected by the road.\nEach road is bi-directional and connects two different cities. It is\nguaranteed that from any city you can pass to any other by roads. There can be\nmore than one road between a pair of cities. The sum of the values of \n    n\n\nfor all sets of input data in the test does not exceed \n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. The\nsum of the values of \n    m\n for all sets of input data in the test does not\nexceed \n    5\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output Print \n    t\n integers \u2014 the answers to the\ngiven test cases in the order they are written in the input.
