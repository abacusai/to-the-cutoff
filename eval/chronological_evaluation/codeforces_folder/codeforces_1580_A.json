        "description": "CQXYM found a rectangle \n    A\n of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n. There are \n    n\n\nrows and \n    m\n columns of blocks. Each block of the rectangle is an obsidian\nblock or empty. CQXYM can change an obsidian block to an empty block or an\nempty block to an obsidian block in one operation. A rectangle \n    M\n size of\n\n    a \n    \u00d7 b\n is called a portal if and only if it satisfies the\nfollowing conditions: \n    a \n    \u2265 5,b \n    \u2265 4\n. For all \n    1 < x < a\n,\nblocks \n    M_x,1\n and \n    M_x,b\n are obsidian blocks. For all \n    1 < x <\n    b\n, blocks \n    M_1,x\n and \n    M_a,x\n are obsidian blocks. For all\n\n    1<x<a,1<y<b\n, block \n    M_x,y\n is an empty block. \n    M_1, 1, M_1,\n    b, M_a, 1, M_a, b\n can be any type. Note that the there must be \n    a\n\nrows and \n    b\n columns, not \n    b\n rows and \n    a\n columns.Note that\ncorners can be any type CQXYM wants to know the minimum number of operations\nhe needs to make at least one sub-rectangle a portal. Input The first line\ncontains an integer \n    t\n (\n    t \n    \u2265 1\n), which is the number of test\ncases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    5 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 400\n, \n    4 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 400\n). Then \n    n\n\nlines follow, each line contains \n    m\n characters \n    0\n or \n    1\n. If the\n\n    j\n-th character of \n    i\n-th line is \n    0\n, block \n    A_i,j\n is an\nempty block. Otherwise, block \n    A_i,j\n is an obsidian block. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    400\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    m\n over all test cases does\nnot exceed \n    400\n. Output Output \n    t\n answers, and each answer in a\nline. Examples Input 1 5 4 1000 0000 0110 0000 0001 Output 12 Input 1 9 9\n001010001 101110100 000010011 100000001 101010101 110001111 000001111\n111100000 000110000 Output 5 Note In the first test case, the final portal is\nlike this: 1110 1001 1001 1001 0111\n\n",
