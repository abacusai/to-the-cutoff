        "description": "The official capital and the cultural capital of Berland are connected by a\nsingle road running through n regions. Each region has a unique climate, so\nthe i-th (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) region has a stable temperature of ti degrees in summer.\nThis summer a group of m schoolchildren wants to get from the official capital\nto the cultural capital to visit museums and sights. The trip organizers\ntransport the children between the cities in buses, but sometimes it is very\nhot. Specifically, if the bus is driving through the i-th region and has k\nschoolchildren, then the temperature inside the bus is ti + k degrees. Of\ncourse, nobody likes it when the bus is hot. So, when the bus drives through\nthe i-th region, if it has more than Ti degrees inside, each of the\nschoolchild in the bus demands compensation for the uncomfortable conditions.\nThe compensation is as large as xi rubles and it is charged in each region\nwhere the temperature in the bus exceeds the limit. To save money, the\norganizers of the trip may arbitrarily add or remove extra buses in the\nbeginning of the trip, and between regions (of course, they need at least one\nbus to pass any region). The organizers can also arbitrarily sort the children\ninto buses, however, each of buses in the i-th region will cost the organizers\ncosti rubles. Please note that sorting children into buses takes no money.\nYour task is to find the minimum number of rubles, which the organizers will\nhave to spend to transport all schoolchildren. Input The first input line\ncontains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of\nregions on the way and the number of schoolchildren in the group,\ncorrespondingly. Next n lines contain four integers each: the i-th line\ncontains ti, Ti, xi and costi (1 \u2264 ti, Ti, xi, costi \u2264 10^6). The numbers in\nthe lines are separated by single spaces. Output Print the only integer \u2014 the\nminimum number of roubles the organizers will have to spend to transport all\nschoolchildren. Please, do not use the \nintegers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the \nspecifier. Examples Input 2 10 30 35 1 100 20 35 10 10 Output 120 Input 3 100\n10 30 1000 1 5 10 1000 3 10 40 1000 100000 Output 200065 Note In the first\nsample the organizers will use only one bus to travel through the first\nregion. However, the temperature in the bus will equal 30 + 10 = 40 degrees\nand each of 10 schoolchildren will ask for compensation. Only one bus will\ntransport the group through the second region too, but the temperature inside\nwon't exceed the limit. Overall, the organizers will spend 100 + 10 + 10 = 120\nrubles.\n\n",
