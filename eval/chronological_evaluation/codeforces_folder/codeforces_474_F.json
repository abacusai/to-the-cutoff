        "description": "Mole is hungry again. He found one ant colony, consisting of n ants, ordered\nin a row. Each ant i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a strength si. In order to make his\ndinner more interesting, Mole organizes a version of \u00abHunger Games\u00bb for the\nants. He chooses two numbers l and r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n) and each pair of ants\nwith indices between l and r (inclusively) will fight. When two ants i and j\nfight, ant i gets one battle point only if si divides sj (also, ant j gets one\nbattle point only if sj divides si). After all fights have been finished, Mole\nmakes the ranking. An ant i, with vi battle points obtained, is going to be\nfreed only if vi = r - l, or in other words only if it took a point in every\nfight it participated. After that, Mole eats the rest of the ants. Note that\nthere can be many ants freed or even none. In order to choose the best\nsequence, Mole gives you t segments [li, ri] and asks for each of them how\nmany ants is he going to eat if those ants fight. Input The first line\ncontains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), the size of the ant colony. The second\nline contains n integers s1, s2, ..., sn (1 \u2264 si \u2264 10^9), the strengths of the\nants. The third line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^5), the number of test\ncases. Each of the next t lines contains two integers li and ri (1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264\nn), describing one query. Output Print to the standard output t lines. The\ni-th line contains number of ants that Mole eats from the segment [li, ri].\nExamples Input 5 1 3 2 4 2 4 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 Output 4 4 1 1 Note In the first\ntest battle points for each ant are v = [4, 0, 2, 0, 2], so ant number 1 is\nfreed. Mole eats the ants 2, 3, 4, 5. In the second test case battle points\nare v = [0, 2, 0, 2], so no ant is freed and all of them are eaten by Mole. In\nthe third test case battle points are v = [2, 0, 2], so ants number 3 and 5\nare freed. Mole eats only the ant 4. In the fourth test case battle points are\nv = [0, 1], so ant number 5 is freed. Mole eats the ant 4.\n\n",
