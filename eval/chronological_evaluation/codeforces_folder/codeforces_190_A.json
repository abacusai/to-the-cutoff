        "name": "Vasya and the Bus",
        "description": "One day Vasya heard a story: \"In the city of High Bertown a bus number 62 left\nfrom the bus station. It had n grown-ups and m kids...\" The latter events\nhappen to be of no importance to us. Vasya is an accountant and he loves\ncounting money. So he wondered what maximum and minimum sum of money these\npassengers could have paid for the ride. The bus fare equals one berland ruble\nin High Bertown. However, not everything is that easy \u2014 no more than one child\ncan ride for free with each grown-up passenger. That means that a grown-up\npassenger who rides with his k (k > 0) children, pays overall k rubles: a\nticket for himself and (k - 1) tickets for his children. Also, a grown-up can\nride without children, in this case he only pays one ruble. We know that in\nHigh Bertown children can't ride in a bus unaccompanied by grown-ups. Help\nVasya count the minimum and the maximum sum in Berland rubles, that all\npassengers of this bus could have paid in total. Input The input file consists\nof a single line containing two space-separated numbers n and m (0 \u2264 n, m \u2264\n10^5) \u2014 the number of the grown-ups and the number of the children in the bus,\ncorrespondingly. Output If n grown-ups and m children could have ridden in the\nbus, then print on a single line two space-separated integers \u2014 the minimum\nand the maximum possible total bus fare, correspondingly. Otherwise, print\n\"Impossible\" (without the quotes). Examples Input 1 2 Output 2 2 Input 0 5\nOutput Impossible Input 2 2 Output 2 3 Note In the first sample a grown-up\nrides with two children and pays two rubles. In the second sample there are\nonly children in the bus, so the situation is impossible. In the third sample\nthere are two cases: Each of the two grown-ups rides with one children and\npays one ruble for the tickets. In this case the passengers pay two rubles in\ntotal. One of the grown-ups ride with two children's and pays two rubles, the\nanother one rides alone and pays one ruble for himself. So, they pay three\nrubles in total.\n\n",
