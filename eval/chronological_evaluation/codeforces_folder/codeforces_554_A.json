        "description": "Kyoya Ootori is selling photobooks of the Ouran High School Host Club. He has\n26 photos, labeled \"a\" to \"z\", and he has compiled them into a photo booklet\nwith some photos in some order (possibly with some photos being duplicated). A\nphoto booklet can be described as a string of lowercase letters, consisting of\nthe photos in the booklet in order. He now wants to sell some \"special\nedition\" photobooks, each with one extra photo inserted anywhere in the book.\nHe wants to make as many distinct photobooks as possible, so he can make more\nmoney. He asks Haruhi, how many distinct photobooks can he make by inserting\none extra photo into the photobook he already has? Please help Haruhi solve\nthis problem. Input The first line of input will be a single string s (1 \u2264 |s|\n\u2264 20). String s consists only of lowercase English letters. Output Output a\nsingle integer equal to the number of distinct photobooks Kyoya Ootori can\nmake. Examples Input a Output 51 Input hi Output 76 Note In the first case, we\ncan make 'ab','ac',...,'az','ba','ca',...,'za', and 'aa', producing a total of\n51 distinct photo booklets.\n\n",
