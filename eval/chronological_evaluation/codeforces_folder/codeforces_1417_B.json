        "description": "RedDreamer has an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n non-negative integers,\nand an unlucky integer \n    T\n. Let's denote the misfortune of array \n    b\n\nhaving length \n    m\n as \n    f(b)\n \u2014 the number of pairs of integers \n    (i,\n    j)\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 i < j \n    \u2264 m\n and \n    b_i + b_j = T\n.\nRedDreamer has to paint each element of \n    a\n into one of two colors, white\nand black (for each element, the color is chosen independently), and then\ncreate two arrays \n    c\n and \n    d\n so that all white elements belong to\n\n    c\n, and all black elements belong to \n    d\n (it is possible that one of\nthese two arrays becomes empty). RedDreamer wants to paint the elements in\nsuch a way that \n    f(c) + f(d)\n is minimum possible. For example: if \n    n =\n    6\n, \n    T = 7\n and \n    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n, it is possible to paint\nthe \n    1\n-st, the \n    4\n-th and the \n    5\n-th elements white, and all\nother elements black. So \n    c = [1, 4, 5]\n, \n    d = [2, 3, 6]\n, and \n    f(c)\n    + f(d) = 0 + 0 = 0\n; if \n    n = 3\n, \n    T = 6\n and \n    a = [3, 3, 3]\n, it\nis possible to paint the \n    1\n-st element white, and all other elements\nblack. So \n    c = [3]\n, \n    d = [3, 3]\n, and \n    f(c) + f(d) = 0 + 1 = 1\n.\nHelp RedDreamer to paint the array optimally! Input The first line contains\none integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThen \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) \u2014 the number of elements in the array and the unlucky integer,\nrespectively. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n,\n..., \n    a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the elements of the array. The\nsum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each\ntest case print \n    n\n integers: \n    p_1\n, \n    p_2\n, ..., \n    p_n\n (each\n\n    p_i\n is either \n    0\n or \n    1\n) denoting the colors. If \n    p_i\n is\n\n    0\n, then \n    a_i\n is white and belongs to the array \n    c\n, otherwise\nit is black and belongs to the array \n    d\n. If there are multiple answers\nthat minimize the value of \n    f(c) + f(d)\n, print any of them. Example Input\n2 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 6 3 3 3 Output 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0\n\n",
