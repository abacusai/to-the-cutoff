        "description": "A competitive eater, Alice is scheduling some practices for an eating contest\non a magical calendar. The calendar is unusual because a week contains not\nnecessarily \n    7\n days! In detail, she can choose any integer \n    k\n which\nsatisfies \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 r\n, and set \n    k\n days as the number of\ndays in a week. Alice is going to paint some \n    n\n consecutive days on this\ncalendar. On this calendar, dates are written from the left cell to the right\ncell in a week. If a date reaches the last day of a week, the next day's cell\nis the leftmost cell in the next (under) row. She wants to make all of the\npainted cells to be connected by side. It means, that for any two painted\ncells there should exist at least one sequence of painted cells, started in\none of these cells, and ended in another, such that any two consecutive cells\nin this sequence are connected by side. Alice is considering the shape of the\npainted cells. Two shapes are the same if there exists a way to make them\nexactly overlapped using only parallel moves, parallel to the calendar's\nsides. For example, in the picture, a week has \n    4\n days and Alice paints\n\n    5\n consecutive days. [1] and [2] are different shapes, but [1] and [3]\nare equal shapes. Alice wants to know how many possible shapes exists if she\nset how many days a week has and choose consecutive \n    n\n days and paints\nthem in calendar started in one of the days of the week. As was said before,\nshe considers only shapes, there all cells are connected by side. Input The\ninput consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Next\n\n    t\n lines contain descriptions of test cases. For each test case, the only\nline contains two integers \n    n\n, \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9, 1 \n    \u2264\n    r \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Output For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the\nanswer to the problem. Please note, that the answer for some test cases won't\nfit into \n    32\n-bit integer type, so you should use at least \n    64\n-bit\ninteger type in your programming language. Example Input 5 3 4 3 2 3 1 13 7\n1010000 9999999 Output 4 3 1 28 510049495001 Note In the first test case,\nAlice can set \n    1,2,3\n or \n    4\n days as the number of days in a week.\nThere are \n    6\n possible paintings shown in the picture, but there are only\n\n    4\n different shapes. So, the answer is \n    4\n. Notice that the last\nexample in the picture is an invalid painting because all cells are not\nconnected by sides. In the last test case, be careful with the overflow issue,\ndescribed in the output format.\n\n",
