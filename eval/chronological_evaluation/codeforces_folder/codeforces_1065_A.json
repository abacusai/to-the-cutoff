This special offer can be used any number of times. Vasya currently has\n\n    s\n roubles, and he wants to get as many chocolate bars for free. Each\nchocolate bar costs \n    c\n roubles. Help Vasya to calculate the maximum\npossible number of chocolate bars he can get! Input The first line contains\none integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of testcases.\nEach of the next \n    t\n lines contains four integers \n    s, a, b, c\u00a0(1 \n    \u2264\n    s, a, b, c \n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 the number of roubles Vasya has, the number of\nchocolate bars you have to buy to use the special offer, the number of bars\nyou get for free, and the cost of one bar, respectively. Output Print \n    t\n\nlines. \n    i\n-th line should contain the maximum possible number of chocolate\nbars Vasya can get in \n    i\n-th test. Example Input 2 10 3 1 1 1000000000 1\n1000000000 1 Output 13 1000000001000000000 Note In the first test of the\nexample Vasya can buy \n    9\n bars, get \n    3\n for free, buy another bar, and\nso he will get \n    13\n bars. In the second test Vasya buys \n    1000000000\n\nbars and gets \n    1000000000000000000\n for free. So he has\n\n    1000000001000000000\n bars.\n\n",
