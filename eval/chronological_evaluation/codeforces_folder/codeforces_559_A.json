        "description": "Gerald got a very curious hexagon for his birthday. The boy found out that all\nthe angles of the hexagon are equal to . Then he measured the length of its\nsides, and found that each of them is equal to an integer number of\ncentimeters. There the properties of the hexagon ended and Gerald decided to\ndraw on it. He painted a few lines, parallel to the sides of the hexagon. The\nlines split the hexagon into regular triangles with sides of 1 centimeter. Now\nGerald wonders how many triangles he has got. But there were so many of them\nthat Gerald lost the track of his counting. Help the boy count the triangles.\nInput The first and the single line of the input contains 6 space-separated\nintegers a1, a2, a3, a4, a5 and a6 (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 1000) \u2014 the lengths of the sides\nof the hexagons in centimeters in the clockwise order. It is guaranteed that\nthe hexagon with the indicated properties and the exactly such sides exists.\nOutput Print a single integer \u2014 the number of triangles with the sides of one\n1 centimeter, into which the hexagon is split. Examples Input 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput 6 Input 1 2 1 2 1 2 Output 13 Note This is what Gerald's hexagon looks\nlike in the first sample: And that's what it looks like in the second sample:\n\n",
