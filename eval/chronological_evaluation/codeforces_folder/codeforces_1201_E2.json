        "description": "This is an interactive problem. Alice and Bob are playing a game on the\nchessboard of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n where \n    n\n and \n    m\n are even. The\nrows are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n and the columns are numbered from\n\n    1\n to \n    m\n. There are two knights on the chessboard. A white one\ninitially is on the position \n    (x_1, y_1)\n, while the black one is on the\nposition \n    (x_2, y_2)\n. Alice will choose one of the knights to play with,\nand Bob will use the other one. The Alice and Bob will play in turns and\nwhoever controls the white knight starts the game. During a turn, the player\nmust move their knight adhering the chess rules. That is, if the knight is\ncurrently on the position \n    (x, y)\n, it can be moved to any of those\npositions (as long as they are inside the chessboard): \n    (x+1, y+2)\n,\n\n    (x+1, y-2)\n, \n    (x-1, y+2)\n, \n    (x-1, y-2)\n,\n    (x+2, y+1)\n,\n\n    (x+2, y-1)\n, \n    (x-2, y+1)\n, \n    (x-2, y-1)\n. We all know that knights\nare strongest in the middle of the board. Both knight have a single position\nthey want to reach: the owner of the white knight wins if it captures the\nblack knight or if the white knight is at \n    (n/2, m/2)\n and this position\nis not under attack of the black knight at this moment; The owner of the black\nknight wins if it captures the white knight or if the black knight is at\n\n    (n/2+1, m/2)\n and this position is not under attack of the white knight\nat this moment. Formally, the player who captures the other knight wins. The\nplayer who is at its target square (\n    (n/2, m/2)\n for white, \n    (n/2+1,\n    m/2)\n for black) and this position is not under opponent's attack, also\nwins. A position is under attack of a knight if it can move into this\nposition. Capturing a knight means that a player moves their knight to the\ncell where the opponent's knight is. If Alice made \n    350\n moves and nobody\nwon, the game is a draw. Alice is unsure in her chess skills, so she asks you\nfor a help. Choose a knight and win the game for her. It can be shown, that\nAlice always has a winning strategy. Interaction The interaction starts with\ntwo integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    6 \n    \u2264 n,m \n    \u2264 1000\n, \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n are even) \u2014 the dimensions of the chessboard. The second line contains\nfour integers \n    x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_1, x_2 \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 y_1, y_2 \n    \u2264 m\n) \u2014 the positions of the white and the black knight.\nIt is guaranteed that the two knights have different starting positions. It is\nalso guaranteed that none of the knights are in their own target square in the\nbeginning of the game (however, they can be on the opponent's target\nposition). Your program should reply with either \"WHITE\" or \"BLACK\", depending\non the knight you want to play with. In case you select the white knight, you\nstart the game. During every your turn, you need to print two integers:\n\n    x\n and \n    y\n, the position to move the knight. If you won the game by\nthis turn, you must terminate your program immediately. After every turn of\nthe opponent, you will receive two integers: \n    x\n and \n    y\n, the position\nwhere Bob moved his knight. If your last move was illegal or you lost the game\nafter jury's turn, or you made \n    350\n moves, and haven't won, you will\nreceive \"-1 -1\". In such cases, you should terminate your program and then you\nwill get a Wrong Answer verdict. After printing anything, do not forget to\noutput the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you might get Idleness\nlimit exceeded. To do this, use: fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\nSystem.out.flush() in Java; flush(output) in Pascal; stdout.flush() in Python;\nsee documentation for other languages.Hacks are disabled for this problem.\nJury's program is adaptive: the moves of jury may depend on the moves made by\nyour program. Examples Input 8 8 2 3 1 8 Output WHITE 4 4 Input 6 6 4 4 2 2 6\n3 Output BLACK 4 3 Note In the first example, the white knight can reach it's\ntarget square in one move. In the second example black knight wins, no matter\nwhat white knight moves.\n\n",
