        "name": "Waste Sorting",
        "description": "The progress is not standing still in Berland. Recently all garbage containers\nin Bertown, the capital of Berland, were replaced by differentiated recycling\nbins, each accepting some category of waste. While this will definitely\nimprove the ecological situation, for some citizens it's difficult to get used\nto the habit of sorting waste. Monocarp is one of those citizens who tries to\nget used to waste sorting. Today he has to take out the trash from his house.\nThere are three containers near the Monocarp's house, the first one accepts\npaper waste, the second one accepts plastic waste, and the third one \u2014 all\nother types of waste. It is possible to fit \n    c_1\n items into the first\ncontainer, \n    c_2\n items into the second container and \n    c_3\n items into\nthe third container. Monocarp has a lot of items to throw into containers.\nSome are made of paper, so Monocarp has to put them into the first container\n(he has \n    a_1\n such items), some are made of plastic, so he has to put them\ninto the second container (he has \n    a_2\n such items), and some are neither\npaper nor plastic \u2014 so Monocarp has to put them into the third container (he\nhas \n    a_3\n such items). Unfortunately, there are also two categories of\nitems that Monocarp is unsure of: he has \n    a_4\n items which are partially\nmade of paper, so he will put each of these items either into the first\ncontainer or into the third container. Similarly, he has \n    a_5\n items\npartially made of plastic, so he has to put each of them either into the\nsecond container or into the third container. Obviously, this choice is made\nseparately for each item \u2014 for example, Monocarp can throw several partially-\nplastic items into the second container, and all other partially-plastic items\n\u2014 into the third one. Now Monocarp wonders: is it possible to put each item\ninto some container so that the first container will hold no more than\n\n    c_1\n items, the second one \u2014 no more than \n    c_2\n items, and the third\none \u2014 no more than \n    c_3\n items? Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case\ncontains three integers \n    c_1\n, \n    c_2\n, \n    c_3\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 c_1, c_2,\n    c_3 \n    \u2264 10^8\n) \u2014 the capacities of the containers. The second line of each\ntest case contains five integers \n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n, \n    a_3\n, \n    a_4\n,\n\n    a_5\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^8\n), where \n    a_i\n is the number of\nitems of the \n    i\n-th category Monocarp has to throw out (\n    i = 1\n is\npaper waste, \n    i = 2\n is plastic waste, \n    i = 3\n is general waste, \n    i\n    = 4\n is partially-paper waste, \n    i = 5\n is partially-plastic waste).\nOutput For each test case, print either YES if it is possible to fit all items\ninto containers, or NO otherwise. You may print each letter in any case (for\nexample, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will all be recognized as positive answer).\nExample Input 7 1 2 3 1 2 3 0 0 2 2 3 1 2 3 1 0 2 2 3 1 2 3 0 1 1 2 5 1 2 3 1\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0 0 0 0 13 37 42 0 0 0 40 47 Output YES YES NO YES\nYES NO YES Note Explanations for the example test cases: Monocarp can put\n\n    1\n item of paper waste into the first container, \n    2\n items of plastic\nwaste into the second container, and \n    3\n items of general waste into the\nthird container; Monocarp can put \n    1\n item of paper waste and \n    1\n item\nof partially-paper waste into the first container, \n    2\n items of plastic\nwaste into the second container, and \n    3\n items of general waste into the\nthird container; there is no answer since either the second container should\ncontain \n    3\n items, or the third container should contain \n    4\n items;\nMonocarp can put \n    1\n item of paper waste into the first container, \n    2\n\nitems of plastic waste into the second container, and \n    3\n items of general\nwaste, \n    1\n item of partially-paper waste and \n    1\n item of partially-\nplastic waste into the third container; there is no waste at all, so all\ncontainers can be left empty; there's no answer since it's impossible to put a\npaper item into the third container; Monocarp can put \n    10\n items of\npartially-paper waste into the first container, \n    37\n items of partially-\nplastic waste into the second container, and \n    30\n items of partially-paper\nwaste and \n    10\n items of partially-plastic waste into the third container.\n\n",
