        "description": "Colossal! \u2014 exclaimed Hawk-nose. \u2014 A programmer! That's exactly what we are\nlooking for. Arkadi and Boris Strugatsky. Monday starts on Saturday Reading\nthe book \"Equations of Mathematical Magic\" Roman Oira-Oira and Cristobal Junta\nfound an interesting equation: \n    a - (a \n    \u2295 x) - x = 0\n for some given\n\n    a\n, where \n    \u2295\n stands for a bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of two\nintegers (this operation is denoted as ^ or xor in many modern programming\nlanguages). Oira-Oira quickly found some \n    x\n, which is the solution of the\nequation, but Cristobal Junta decided that Oira-Oira's result is not\ninteresting enough, so he asked his colleague how many non-negative solutions\nof this equation exist. This task turned out to be too difficult for Oira-\nOira, so he asks you to help. Input Each test contains several possible values\nof \n    a\n and your task is to find the number of equation's solution for each\nof them. The first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of these values. The following \n    t\n lines contain the\nvalues of parameter \n    a\n, each value is an integer from \n    0\n to\n\n    2^30 - 1\n inclusive. Output For each value of \n    a\n print exactly one\ninteger \u2014 the number of non-negative solutions of the equation for the given\nvalue of the parameter. Print answers in the same order as values of \n    a\n\nappear in the input. One can show that the number of solutions is always\nfinite. Example Input 3 0 2 1073741823 Output 1 2 1073741824 Note Let's define\nthe bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operation. Given two integers \n    x\n and\n\n    y\n, consider their binary representations (possibly with leading zeroes):\n\n    x_k \n    \u2026 x_2 x_1 x_0\n and \n    y_k \n    \u2026 y_2 y_1 y_0\n. Here,\n\n    x_i\n is the \n    i\n-th bit of the number \n    x\n and \n    y_i\n is the\n\n    i\n-th bit of the number \n    y\n. Let \n    r = x \n    \u2295 y\n be the result\nof the XOR operation of \n    x\n and \n    y\n. Then \n    r\n is defined as \n    r_k\n    \n    \u2026 r_2 r_1 r_0\n where: \n    \n\n    r_i = \n    \n    \n    \n     1, \u00a0\n    if\u00a0 x_i \n     y_i \n    \n    \n     0, \u00a0\n    if\u00a0 x_i = y_i\n    \n    \n    . \n        \n    \n        For the first value of the parameter, only\n    x = 0\n        is a solution of the equation. For the second value of the\n        parameter, solutions are\n    x = 0\n        and\n    x = 2\n        .\n",
