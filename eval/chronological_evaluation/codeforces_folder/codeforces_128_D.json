        "description": "One day Anna got the following task at school: to arrange several numbers in a\ncircle so that any two neighboring numbers differs exactly by 1. Anna was\ngiven several numbers and arranged them in a circle to fulfill the task. Then\nshe wanted to check if she had arranged the numbers correctly, but at this\npoint her younger sister Maria came and shuffled all numbers. Anna got sick\nwith anger but what's done is done and the results of her work had been\ndestroyed. But please tell Anna: could she have hypothetically completed the\ntask using all those given numbers? Input The first line contains an integer n\n\u2014 how many numbers Anna had (3 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The next line contains those\nnumbers, separated by a space. All numbers are integers and belong to the\nrange from 1 to 10^9. Output Print the single line \"YES\" (without the quotes),\nif Anna could have completed the task correctly using all those numbers (using\nall of them is necessary). If Anna couldn't have fulfilled the task, no matter\nhow hard she would try, print \"NO\" (without the quotes). Examples Input 4 1 2\n3 2 Output YES Input 6 1 1 2 2 2 3 Output YES Input 6 2 4 1 1 2 2 Output NO\n\n",
