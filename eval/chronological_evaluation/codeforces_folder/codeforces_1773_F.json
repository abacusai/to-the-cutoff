        "description": "Scientists are researching an impact of football match results on the mood of\nfootball fans. They have a hypothesis that there is a correlation between the\nnumber of draws and fans' desire to watch football matches in the future. In\nfootball, two teams play a match. The teams score goals throughout a match. A\nscore \"\n    x\n:\n    y\n\" means that the team we observe scored \n    x\n goals\nand conceded \n    y\n goals. If \n    x = y\n, then the match ends in a draw. If\n\n    x > y\n, then the observed team wins, and if \n    x < y\n, then it loses.\nTo find out if there is a correlation, the scientists gathered information\nabout the results of teams in lower leagues. The information they found is the\nnumber of matches played by the team (\n    n\n), the number of goals scored in\nthese matches (\n    a\n), and the number of goals conceded in these matches\n(\n    b\n). You are given this information for a single team. You are asked to\ncalculate the minimum number of draws that could have happened during the\nteam's matches and provide a list of match scores with the minimum number of\ndraws. Input The first line contains an integer \n    n\n \u2014 the number of\nmatches played by the team (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n). The second line\ncontains an integer \n    a\n \u2014 the total number of goals scored by the team in\nall \n    n\n matches (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a \n    \u2264 1000\n). The third line contains an\ninteger \n    b\n \u2014 the total number of goals conceded by the team in all\n\n    n\n matches (\n    0 \n    \u2264 b \n    \u2264 1000\n). Output In the first line, print\na single integer \n    d\n \u2014 the minimum number of draws. In the following\n\n    n\n lines, print a list of match scores, each line in the format\n\"\n    x\n:\n    y\n\", where \n    x\n is the number of goals scored in the match,\nand \n    y\n \u2013 the number of goals conceded, so that exactly \n    d\n of these\nmatches have ended in a draw. In case multiple such lists of match scores\nexist, print any of them.
