        "description": "There is an infinite set generated as follows: \n    1\n is in this set. If\n\n    x\n is in this set, \n    x \n    \u00b7 a\n and \n    x+b\n both are in this set.\nFor example, when \n    a=3\n and \n    b=6\n, the five smallest elements of the\nset are: \n    1\n, \n    3\n (\n    1\n is in this set, so \n    1\n    \u00b7 a=3\n is in\nthis set), \n    7\n (\n    1\n is in this set, so \n    1+b=7\n is in this set),\n\n    9\n (\n    3\n is in this set, so \n    3\n    \u00b7 a=9\n is in this set),\n\n    13\n (\n    7\n is in this set, so \n    7+b=13\n is in this set). Given\npositive integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    n\n, determine if \n    n\n is in this\nset. Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains\nan integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe description of the test cases follows. The only line describing each test\ncase contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    a\n, \n    b\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n,a,b\n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) separated by a single space. Output For each test case, print \"Yes\"\nif \n    n\n is in this set, and \"No\" otherwise. You can print each letter in\nany case. Example Input 5 24 3 5 10 3 6 2345 1 4 19260817 394 485 19260817 233\n264 Output Yes No Yes No Yes Note In the first test case, \n    24\n is\ngenerated as follows: \n    1\n is in this set, so \n    3\n and \n    6\n are in\nthis set; \n    3\n is in this set, so \n    9\n and \n    8\n are in this set;\n\n    8\n is in this set, so \n    24\n and \n    13\n are in this set. Thus we can\nsee \n    24\n is in this set. The five smallest elements of the set in the\nsecond test case is described in statements. We can see that \n    10\n isn't\namong them.\n\n",
