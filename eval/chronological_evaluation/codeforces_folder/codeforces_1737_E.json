        "description": "Ela likes to go hiking a lot. She loves nature and exploring the various\ncreatures it offers. One day, she saw a strange type of ant, with a\ncannibalistic feature. More specifically, an ant would eat any ants that it\nsees which is smaller than it.Curious about this feature from a new creature,\nEla ain't furious. She conducts a long, non-dubious, sentimental experiment.\nShe puts \n    n\n cannibalistic ants in a line on a long wooden stick.\nInitially, the ants have the same weight of \n    1\n. The distance between any\ntwo consecutive ants is the same. The distance between the first ant in the\nline to the left end and the last ant in the line to the right end is also the\nsame as the distance between the ants. Each ant starts moving towards the\nleft-end or the right-end randomly and equiprobably, at the same constant pace\nthroughout the experiment. Two ants will crash if they are standing next to\neach other in the line and moving in opposite directions, and ants will change\ndirection immediately when they reach the end of the stick. Ela can't\ndetermine the moving direction of each ant, but she understands very well\ntheir behavior when crashes happen. If a crash happens between two ants of\ndifferent weights, the heavier one will eat the lighter one, and gain the\nweight of the lighter one. After that, the heavier and will continue walking\nin the same direction. In other words, if the heavier one has weight \n    x\n\nand walking to the right, the lighter one has weight \n    y\n and walking to\nthe left (\n    x > y\n), then after the crash, the lighter one will diminish,\nand the heavier one will have weight \n    x + y\n and continue walking to the\nright. If a crash happens between two ants with the same weight, the one\nwalking to the left end of the stick will eat the one walking to the right,\nand then continue walking in the same direction. In other words, if one ant of\nweight \n    x\n walking to the left, crashes with another ant of weight \n    x\n\nwalking to the right, the one walking to the right will disappear, and the one\nwalking to the left will have to weight \n    2x\n and continue walking to the\nleft. Please, check the example in the \"Note\" section, which will demonstrate\nthe ants' behavior as above. We can prove that after a definite amount of\ntime, there will be only one last ant standing. Initially, each ant can\nrandomly and equiprobably move to the left or the right, which generates\n\n    2^n\n different cases of initial movements for the whole pack. For each\nposition in the line, calculate the probability that the ant begins in that\nposition and survives. Output it modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Formally, let \n    M =\n    10^9 + 7\n. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an\nirreducible fraction \n    p/q\n, where \n    p\n and \n    q\n are\nintegers and \n    q \n    \u2261 0 \n    M\n. Output the integer equal to\n\n    p \n    \u00b7 q^-1\n     M\n. In other words, output such an integer\n\n    x\n that \n    0 \n    \u2264 x < M\n and \n    x \n    \u00b7 q \n    \u2261 p \n    M\n.\nInput Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the\nnumber of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n). The description of\nthe test cases follows. The only line of each test contains an integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number of ants in the experiment. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n in all tests will not exceed \n    10^6\n.\nOutput For each test, print \n    n\n lines. \n    i\n-th line contains a single\nnumber that denotes the survival probability of the \n    i\n-th ant in the line\nmodulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Example Input 3 4 5 2 Output 0 250000002 250000002\n500000004 0 250000002 250000002 250000002 250000002 0 1 Note Here is the\nexample of \n    6\n ants moving on the branch. An ant's movement will be\ndenoted by either a character \n    L\n or \n    R\n. Initially, the pack of ants\non the branch will move as \n    RLRRLR\n. Here's how the behavior of the pack\ndemonstrated: Initially, the ants are positioned as above. After a while, the\nant with index \n    2\n (walking to the left) will crash with the ant with\nindex \n    1\n (walking to the right). The two ants have the same weight,\ntherefore, ant \n    2\n will eat ant \n    1\n and gain its weight to \n    2\n.\nThe same thing happens with ant \n    5\n and ant \n    4\n. The ant \n    6\n will\nwalk to the end of the stick, therefore changing its direction. After that,\nthe ant with index \n    5\n will crash with the ant with index \n    3\n. Since\nant \n    5\n is more heavy (weight=\n    2\n) than ant \n    3\n (weight=\n    1\n),\nant \n    5\n will eat ant \n    3\n and gain its weight to \n    3\n. Ant \n    2\n\nwill walk to the end of the stick, therefore changing its direction. After\nthat, the ant with index \n    5\n will crash with the ant with index \n    2\n.\nSince ant \n    5\n is more heavy (weight=\n    3\n) than ant \n    2\n\n(weight=\n    2\n), ant \n    5\n will eat ant \n    2\n and gain its weight to\n\n    5\n. Lastly, after ant \n    5\n walk to the end of the branch and changes\nits direction, ant \n    5\n will eat ant \n    6\n and be the last ant standing.\n\n",
