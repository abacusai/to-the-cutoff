        "name": "Alena's Schedule",
        "description": "Alena has successfully passed the entrance exams to the university and is now\nlooking forward to start studying. One two-hour lesson at the Russian\nuniversity is traditionally called a pair, it lasts for two academic hours (an\nacademic hour is equal to 45 minutes). The University works in such a way that\nevery day it holds exactly n lessons. Depending on the schedule of a\nparticular group of students, on a given day, some pairs may actually contain\nclasses, but some may be empty (such pairs are called breaks). The official\nwebsite of the university has already published the schedule for tomorrow for\nAlena's group. Thus, for each of the n pairs she knows if there will be a\nclass at that time or not. Alena's House is far from the university, so if\nthere are breaks, she doesn't always go home. Alena has time to go home only\nif the break consists of at least two free pairs in a row, otherwise she waits\nfor the next pair at the university. Of course, Alena does not want to be\nsleepy during pairs, so she will sleep as long as possible, and will only come\nto the first pair that is presented in her schedule. Similarly, if there are\nno more pairs, then Alena immediately goes home. Alena appreciates the time\nspent at home, so she always goes home when it is possible, and returns to the\nuniversity only at the beginning of the next pair. Help Alena determine for\nhow many pairs she will stay at the university. Note that during some pairs\nAlena may be at the university waiting for the upcoming pair. Input The first\nline of the input contains a positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of\nlessons at the university. The second line contains n numbers ai (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 1).\nNumber ai equals 0, if Alena doesn't have the i-th pairs, otherwise it is\nequal to 1. Numbers a1, a2, ..., an are separated by spaces. Output Print a\nsingle number \u2014 the number of pairs during which Alena stays at the\nuniversity. Examples Input 5 0 1 0 1 1 Output 4 Input 7 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 Output 4\nInput 1 0 Output 0 Note In the first sample Alena stays at the university from\nthe second to the fifth pair, inclusive, during the third pair she will be it\nthe university waiting for the next pair. In the last sample Alena doesn't\nhave a single pair, so she spends all the time at home.\n\n",
