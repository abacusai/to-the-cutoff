        "description": "You are given a tree with \n    n\n nodes. As a reminder, a tree is a connected\nundirected graph without cycles. Let \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n be a\nsequence of integers. Perform the following operation exactly \n    n\n times:\nSelect an unerased node \n    u\n. Assign \n    a_u :=\n number of unerased nodes\nadjacent to \n    u\n. Then, erase the node \n    u\n along with all edges that\nhave it as an endpoint. For each integer \n    k\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, find\nthe number, modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n, of different sequences \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n that satisfy the following conditions: it is possible to\nobtain \n    a\n by performing the aforementioned operations exactly \n    n\n\ntimes in some order. \n    gcd(a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n) = k\n.\nHere, \n    gcd\n means the greatest common divisor of the\nelements in \n    a\n. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line\nof each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n). Each of the next \n    n - 1\n lines contains two integers \n    u\n and\n\n    v\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u, v \n    \u2264 n\n) indicating there is an edge between\nvertices \n    u\n and \n    v\n. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a\ntree. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases doesn't\nexceed \n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print \n    n\n integers\nin a single line, where for each \n    k\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, the\n\n    k\n-th integer denotes the answer when \n    gcd\n equals\nto \n    k\n. Example Input 2 3 2 1 1 3 2 1 2 Output 3 1 0 2 0 Note In the first\ntest case, If we delete the nodes in order \n    1 \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192\n    3\n or \n    1 \n    \u2192 3 \n    \u2192 2\n, then the obtained sequence\nwill be \n    a = [2, 0, 0]\n which has \n    gcd\n equals to\n\n    2\n. If we delete the nodes in order \n    2 \n    \u2192 1 \n    \u2192\n    3\n, then the obtained sequence will be \n    a = [1, 1, 0]\n which has\n\n    gcd\n equals to \n    1\n. If we delete the nodes in order\n\n    3 \n    \u2192 1 \n    \u2192 2\n, then the obtained sequence will be\n\n    a = [1, 0, 1]\n which has \n    gcd\n equals to \n    1\n. If\nwe delete the nodes in order \n    2 \n    \u2192 3 \n    \u2192 1\n or \n    3\n    \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 1\n, then the obtained sequence will be \n    a =\n    [0, 1, 1]\n which has \n    gcd\n equals to \n    1\n. Note that\nhere we are counting the number of different sequences, not the number of\ndifferent orders of deleting nodes.\n\n",
