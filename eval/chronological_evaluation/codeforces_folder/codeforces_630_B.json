        "description": "The city administration of IT City decided to fix up a symbol of scientific\nand technical progress in the city's main square, namely an indicator board\nthat shows the effect of Moore's law in real time. Moore's law is the\nobservation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit\ndoubles approximately every 24 months. The implication of Moore's law is that\ncomputer performance as function of time increases exponentially as well. You\nare to prepare information that will change every second to display on the\nindicator board. Let's assume that every second the number of transistors\nincreases exactly 1.000000011 times. Input The only line of the input contains\na pair of integers n (1000 \u2264 n \u2264 10 000) and t (0 \u2264 t \u2264 2 000 000 000) \u2014 the\nnumber of transistors in the initial time and the number of seconds passed\nsince the initial time. Output Output one number \u2014 the estimate of the number\nof transistors in a dence integrated circuit in t seconds since the initial\ntime. The relative error of your answer should not be greater than 10^-6.\nExamples Input 1000 1000000 Output 1011.060722383550382782399454922040\n\n",
