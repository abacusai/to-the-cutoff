        "description": "Consider an array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n consisting of numbers \n    1\n\nand \n    -1\n. Define \n    A\n-characteristic of this array as a number of pairs\nof indices \n    1 \n    \u2264 i < j \n    \u2264 n\n, such that \n    a_i \n    \u00b7 a_j = 1\n.\nFind any array \n    a\n with given length \n    n\n with \n    A\n-characteristic\nequal to the given value \n    k\n. Input Each test contains multiple test\ncases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 100\n). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of\neach test case contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    100\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264\n    (n-1) n/2\n) \u2014 the length of required\narray and required \n    A\n-characteristic. Output For each test case, if there\nis no array \n    a\n with given \n    A\n-characteristic \n    k\n, print NO.\nOtherwise, print YES and \n    n\n numbers \n    1\n and \n    -1\n, which form the\nrequired array \n    a\n. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nExample Input 7 2 0 2 1 3 1 3 2 3 3 5 4 5 5 Output YES 1 -1 YES 1 1 YES 1 -1 1\nNO YES 1 1 1 YES -1 1 -1 1 1 NO Note In the first test case, there is only one\npair of different elements in the array, and their product is \n    a_1 \n    \u00b7\n    a_2 = -1 \n    \u2260 1\n, hence its \n    A\n-characteristic is \n    0\n. In the\nsecond test case, there is only one pair of different elements in the array,\nand their product is \n    a_1 \n    \u00b7 a_2 = 1\n, hence its\n\n    A\n-characteristic is \n    1\n. In the third test case, there are three\npairs of different elements in the array, and their product are: \n    a_1\n    \n    \u00b7 a_2 = -1\n, \n    a_1 \n    \u00b7 a_3 = 1\n, \n    a_2 \n    \u00b7 a_3 = -1\n,\nhence its \n    A\n-characteristic is \n    1\n. In the fourth test case, we can\nshow, that there is no array with length \n    3\n, which \n    A\n-characteristic\nis \n    2\n.\n\n",
