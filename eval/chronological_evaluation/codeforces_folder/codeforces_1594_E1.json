        "name": "Rubik's Cube Coloring (easy version)",
        "description": "It is the easy version of the problem. The difference is that in this version,\nthere are no nodes with already chosen colors. Theofanis is starving, and he\nwants to eat his favorite food, sheftalia. However, he should first finish his\nhomework. Can you help him with this problem? You have a perfect binary tree\nof \n    2^k - 1\n nodes \u2014 a binary tree where all vertices \n    i\n from \n    1\n\nto \n    2^k - 1 - 1\n have exactly two children: vertices \n    2i\n and \n    2i\n    + 1\n. Vertices from \n    2^k - 1\n to \n    2^k - 1\n don't have any\nchildren. You want to color its vertices with the \n    6\n Rubik's cube colors\n(White, Green, Red, Blue, Orange and Yellow). Let's call a coloring good when\nall edges connect nodes with colors that are neighboring sides in the Rubik's\ncube. A picture of Rubik's cube and its 2D map. More formally: a white node\ncan not be neighboring with white and yellow nodes; a yellow node can not be\nneighboring with white and yellow nodes; a green node can not be neighboring\nwith green and blue nodes; a blue node can not be neighboring with green and\nblue nodes; a red node can not be neighboring with red and orange nodes; an\norange node can not be neighboring with red and orange nodes; You want to\ncalculate the number of the good colorings of the binary tree. Two colorings\nare considered different if at least one node is colored with a different\ncolor. The answer may be too large, so output the answer modulo \n    10^9+7\n.\nInput The first and only line contains the integers \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k\n    \n    \u2264 60\n) \u2014 the number of levels in the perfect binary tree you need to\ncolor. Output Print one integer \u2014 the number of the different colorings modulo\n\n    10^9+7\n. Examples Input 3 Output 24576 Input 14 Output 934234 Note In the\npicture below, you can see one of the correct colorings of the first example.\n\n",
