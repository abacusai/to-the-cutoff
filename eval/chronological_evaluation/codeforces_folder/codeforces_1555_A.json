        "description": "PizzaForces is Petya's favorite pizzeria. PizzaForces makes and sells pizzas\nof three sizes: small pizzas consist of \n    6\n slices, medium ones consist of\n\n    8\n slices, and large pizzas consist of \n    10\n slices each. Baking them\ntakes \n    15\n, \n    20\n and \n    25\n minutes, respectively. Petya's birthday\nis today, and \n    n\n of his friends will come, so he decided to make an order\nfrom his favorite pizzeria. Petya wants to order so much pizza that each of\nhis friends gets at least one slice of pizza. The cooking time of the order is\nthe total baking time of all the pizzas in the order. Your task is to\ndetermine the minimum number of minutes that is needed to make pizzas\ncontaining at least \n    n\n slices in total. For example: if \n    12\n friends\ncome to Petya's birthday, he has to order pizzas containing at least \n    12\n\nslices in total. He can order two small pizzas, containing exactly \n    12\n\nslices, and the time to bake them is \n    30\n minutes; if \n    15\n friends\ncome to Petya's birthday, he has to order pizzas containing at least \n    15\n\nslices in total. He can order a small pizza and a large pizza, containing\n\n    16\n slices, and the time to bake them is \n    40\n minutes; if \n    300\n\nfriends come to Petya's birthday, he has to order pizzas containing at least\n\n    300\n slices in total. He can order \n    15\n small pizzas, \n    10\n medium\npizzas and \n    13\n large pizzas, in total they contain \n    15 \n    \u00b7 6 + 10\n    \n    \u00b7 8 + 13 \n    \u00b7 10 = 300\n slices, and the total time to bake them is\n\n    15 \n    \u00b7 15 + 10 \n    \u00b7 20 + 13 \n    \u00b7 25 = 750\n minutes; if only one\nfriend comes to Petya's birthday, he can order a small pizza, and the time to\nbake it is \n    15\n minutes. Input The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. Each testcase\nconsists of a single line that contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^16\n) \u2014 the number of Petya's friends. Output For each testcase,\nprint one integer \u2014 the minimum number of minutes that is needed to bake\npizzas containing at least \n    n\n slices in total. Example Input 6 12 15 300\n1 9999999999999999 3 Output 30 40 750 15 25000000000000000 15\n\n",
