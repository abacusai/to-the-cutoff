        "description": "You are given an array of exactly \n    n\n numbers \n    [1,2,3,\n    \u2026,n]\n\nalong with integers \n    k\n and \n    x\n. Partition the array in exactly\n\n    k\n non-empty disjoint subsequences such that the bitwise XOR of all\nnumbers in each subsequence is \n    x\n, and each number is in exactly one\nsubsequence. Notice that there are no constraints on the length of each\nsubsequence. A sequence \n    a\n is a subsequence of a sequence \n    b\n if\n\n    a\n can be obtained from \n    b\n by the deletion of several (possibly,\nzero or all) elements. For example, for \n    n = 15\n, \n    k = 6\n, \n    x =\n    7\n, the following scheme is valid: \n    [6,10,11]\n, \n    6 \n    \u2295 10\n    \n    \u2295 11 = 7\n, \n    [5,12,14]\n, \n    5 \n    \u2295 12 \n    \u2295 14 = 7\n,\n\n    [3,9,13]\n, \n    3 \n    \u2295 9 \n    \u2295 13 = 7\n, \n    [1,2,4]\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2295 2 \n    \u2295 4 = 7\n, \n    [8,15]\n, \n    8 \n    \u2295 15 = 7\n,\n\n    [7]\n, \n    7 = 7\n, where \n    \u2295\n represents the bitwise XOR\noperation.The following scheme is invalid, since \n    8\n, \n    15\n do not\nappear: \n    [6,10,11]\n, \n    6 \n    \u2295 10 \n    \u2295 11 = 7\n, \n    [5,12,14]\n,\n\n    5 \n    \u2295 12 \n    \u2295 14 = 7\n, \n    [3,9,13]\n, \n    3 \n    \u2295 9 \n    \u2295\n    13 = 7\n, \n    [1,2,4]\n, \n    1 \n    \u2295 2 \n    \u2295 4 = 7\n, \n    [7]\n, \n    7 =\n    7\n. The following scheme is invalid, since \n    3\n appears twice, and\n\n    1\n, \n    2\n do not appear: \n    [6,10,11]\n, \n    6 \n    \u2295 10 \n    \u2295 11\n    = 7\n, \n    [5,12,14]\n, \n    5 \n    \u2295 12 \n    \u2295 14 = 7\n, \n    [3,9,13]\n,\n\n    3 \n    \u2295 9 \n    \u2295 13 = 7\n, \n    [3,4]\n, \n    3 \n    \u2295 4 = 7\n,\n\n    [8,15]\n, \n    8 \n    \u2295 15 = 7\n, \n    [7]\n, \n    7 = 7\n. Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first and the only line\nof each test case contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    k\n, \n    x\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    1\n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the\nlength of the array, the number of subsequences and the required XOR. It's\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n.\nOutput For each test case, if it is possible to partition the sequence, print\n\"YES\" in the first line. In the \n    i\n-th of the following \n    k\n lines\nfirst print the length \n    s_i\n of the \n    i\n-th subsequence, then print\n\n    s_i\n integers, representing the elements in the \n    i\n-th subsequence.\nIf there are multiple answers, print any. Note that you can print a\nsubsequence in any order. If it is not possible to partition the sequence,\nprint \"NO\". Example Input 7 15 6 7 11 4 5 5 3 2 4 1 4 6 1 7 11 5 5 11 6 5\nOutput YES 3 6 10 11 3 5 12 14 3 3 9 13 3 1 2 4 2 8 15 1 7 YES 2 1 4 2 2 7 2 3\n6 5 5 8 9 10 11 NO YES 4 1 2 3 4 YES 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 NO NO Note In the first\ntest case, we construct the following \n    6\n subsequences: \n    [6,10,11]\n,\n\n    6 \n    \u2295 10 \n    \u2295 11 = 7\n, \n    [5,12,14]\n, \n    5 \n    \u2295 12\n    \n    \u2295 14 = 7\n, \n    [3,9,13]\n, \n    3 \n    \u2295 9 \n    \u2295 13 = 7\n,\n\n    [1,2,4]\n, \n    1 \n    \u2295 2 \n    \u2295 4 = 7\n, \n    [8,15]\n, \n    8 \n    \u2295\n    15 = 7\n, \n    [7]\n, \n    7 = 7\n. In the second test case, we construct the\nfollowing \n    4\n subsequences: \n    [1,4]\n, \n    1 \n    \u2295 4 = 5\n,\n\n    [2,7]\n, \n    2 \n    \u2295 7 = 5\n, \n    [3,6]\n, \n    3 \n    \u2295 6 = 5\n,\n\n    [5,8,9,10,11]\n, \n    5 \n    \u2295 8 \n    \u2295 9 \n    \u2295 10 \n    \u2295 11 =\n    5\n. The following solution is considered correct in this test case as well:\n\n    [1,4]\n, \n    1 \n    \u2295 4 = 5\n, \n    [2,7]\n, \n    2 \n    \u2295 7 = 5\n,\n\n    [5]\n, \n    5 = 5\n, \n    [3,6,8,9,10,11]\n, \n    3 \n    \u2295 6 \n    \u2295 8\n    \n    \u2295 9 \n    \u2295 10 \n    \u2295 11 = 5\n.\n\n",
