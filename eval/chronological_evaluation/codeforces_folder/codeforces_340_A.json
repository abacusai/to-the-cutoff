        "description": "Iahub and his friend Floyd have started painting a wall. Iahub is painting the\nwall red and Floyd is painting it pink. You can consider the wall being made\nof a very large number of bricks, numbered 1, 2, 3 and so on. Iahub has the\nfollowing scheme of painting: he skips x - 1 consecutive bricks, then he\npaints the x-th one. That is, he'll paint bricks x, 2\u00b7x, 3\u00b7x and so on red.\nSimilarly, Floyd skips y - 1 consecutive bricks, then he paints the y-th one.\nHence he'll paint bricks y, 2\u00b7y, 3\u00b7y and so on pink. After painting the wall\nall day, the boys observed that some bricks are painted both red and pink.\nIahub has a lucky number a and Floyd has a lucky number b. Boys wonder how\nmany bricks numbered no less than a and no greater than b are painted both red\nand pink. This is exactly your task: compute and print the answer to the\nquestion. Input The input will have a single line containing four integers in\nthis order: x, y, a, b. (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 2\u00b710^9, a \u2264 b). Output\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the number of bricks numbered no less than a and no\ngreater than b that are painted both red and pink. Examples Input 2 3 6 18\nOutput 3 Note Let's look at the bricks from a to b (a = 6, b = 18). The bricks\ncolored in red are numbered 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18. The bricks colored in\npink are numbered 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. The bricks colored in both red and pink\nare numbered with 6, 12 and 18.\n\n",
