        "description": "This is the easy version of this problem. The difference between easy and hard\nversions is only the constraints on \n    a_i\n and on \n    n\n. You can make\nhacks only if both versions of the problem are solved. Burenka is the crown\nprincess of Buryatia, and soon she will become the \n    n\n-th queen of the\ncountry. There is an ancient tradition in Buryatia \u2014 before the coronation,\nthe ruler must show their strength to the inhabitants. To determine the\nstrength of the \n    n\n-th ruler, the inhabitants of the country give them an\narray of \n    a\n of exactly \n    n\n numbers, after which the ruler must turn\nall the elements of the array into zeros in the shortest time. The ruler can\ndo the following two-step operation any number of times: select two indices\n\n    l\n and \n    r\n, so that \n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n and a non-\nnegative integer \n    x\n, then for all \n    l \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 r\n assign \n    a_i\n    := a_i \n    \u2295 x\n, where \n    \u2295\n denotes the bitwise XOR operation.\nIt takes \n    \u2308\n    r-l+1/2\n    \n    \u2309\n seconds to\ndo this operation, where \n    \u2308 y \n    \u2309\n denotes \n    y\n rounded up\nto the nearest integer. Help Burenka calculate how much time she will need.\nInput The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    500\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    n \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the size of the array. The second line of each test case\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    5000\n) \u2014 elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n in\nall tests does not exceed \n    5000\n. Output For each test case, output a\nsingle number \u2014 the minimum time that Burenka will need. Example Input 7 4 5 5\n5 5 3 1 3 2 2 0 0 3 2 5 7 6 1 2 3 3 2 1 10 27 27 34 32 2 31 23 56 52 4 5 1822\n1799 57 23 55 Output 2 2 0 2 4 7 4 Note In the first test case, Burenka can\nchoose segment \n    l = 1\n, \n    r = 4\n, and \n    x=5\n. so it will fill the\narray with zeros in \n    2\n seconds. In the second test case, Burenka first\nselects segment \n    l = 1\n, \n    r = 2\n, and \n    x = 1\n, after which \n    a =\n    [0, 2, 2]\n, and then the segment \n    l = 2\n, \n    r = 3\n, and \n    x=2\n,\nwhich fills the array with zeros. In total, Burenka will spend \n    2\n\nseconds.\n\n",
