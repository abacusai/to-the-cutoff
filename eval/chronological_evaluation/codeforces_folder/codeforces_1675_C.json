        "description": "Polycarp bought a new expensive painting and decided to show it to his \n    n\n\nfriends. He hung it in his room. \n    n\n of his friends entered and exited\nthere one by one. At one moment there was no more than one person in the room.\nIn other words, the first friend entered and left first, then the second, and\nso on. It is known that at the beginning (before visiting friends) a picture\nhung in the room. At the end (after the \n    n\n-th friend) it turned out that\nit disappeared. At what exact moment it disappeared \u2014 there is no information.\nPolycarp asked his friends one by one. He asked each one if there was a\npicture when he entered the room. Each friend answered one of three: no\n(response encoded with 0); yes (response encoded as 1); can't remember\n(response is encoded with ?). Everyone except the thief either doesn't\nremember or told the truth. The thief can say anything (any of the three\noptions). Polycarp cannot understand who the thief is. He asks you to find out\nthe number of those who can be considered a thief according to the answers.\nInput The first number \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases in the test. The following is a description of test cases. The\nfirst line of each test case contains one string \n    s\n (length does not\nexceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 a description of the friends' answers, where\n\n    s_i\n indicates the answer of the \n    i\n-th friend. Each character in the\nstring is either 0 or 1 or ?. The given regularity is described in the actual\nsituation. In particular, on the basis of answers, at least one friend can be\nsuspected of stealing a painting. It is guaranteed that the sum of string\nlengths over the entire input data set does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n.\nOutput Output one positive (strictly more zero) number \u2013 the number of people\nwho could steal the picture based on the data shown. Example Input 8 0 1\n1110000 ????? 1?1??0?0 0?0??? ??11 ??0?? Output 1 1 2 5 4 1 1 3 Note In the\nfirst case, the answer is \n    1\n since we had exactly \n    1\n friend. The\nsecond case is similar to the first. In the third case, the suspects are the\nthird and fourth friends (we count from one). It can be shown that no one else\ncould be the thief. In the fourth case, we know absolutely nothing, so we\nsuspect everyone.\n\n",
