        "description": "The round carousel consists of \n    n\n figures of animals. Figures are\nnumbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n in order of the carousel moving. Thus, after\nthe \n    n\n-th figure the figure with the number \n    1\n follows. Each figure\nhas its own type \u2014 the type of the animal corresponding to this figure (the\nhorse, the tiger and so on). The type of animal of the \n    i\n-th figure\nequals \n    t_i\n. The example of the carousel for \n    n=9\n and \n    t=[5, 5, 1,\n    15, 1, 5, 5, 1, 1]\n. You want to color each figure in one of the colors. You\nthink that it's boring if the carousel contains two different figures (with\nthe distinct types of animals) going one right after another and colored in\nthe same color. Your task is to color the figures in such a way that the\nnumber of distinct colors used is the minimum possible and there are no\nfigures of the different types going one right after another and colored in\nthe same color. If you use exactly \n    k\n distinct colors, then the colors of\nfigures should be denoted with integers from \n    1\n to \n    k\n. Input The\ninput contains one or more test cases. The first line contains one integer\n\n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\nThen \n    q\n test cases follow. One test case is given on two lines. The first\nline of the test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of figures in the carousel. Figures are numbered\nfrom \n    1\n to \n    n\n in order of carousel moving. Assume that after the\n\n    n\n-th figure the figure \n    1\n goes. The second line of the test case\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    t_1, t_2, \n    \u2026, t_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t_i \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n), where \n    t_i\n is the type of the animal of the \n    i\n-th\nfigure. The sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output Print \n    q\n answers, for each test case print two\nlines. In the first line print one integer \n    k\n \u2014 the minimum possible\nnumber of distinct colors of figures. In the second line print \n    n\n\nintegers \n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 k\n), where\n\n    c_i\n is the color of the \n    i\n-th figure. If there are several answers,\nyou can print any. Example Input 4 5 1 2 1 2 2 6 1 2 2 1 2 2 5 1 2 1 2 3 3 10\n10 10 Output 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 3 1 1 1 1 1\n\n",
