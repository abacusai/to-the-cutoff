        "description": "Leha decided to move to a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis, because he was tired by\nliving in Bankopolis. Upon arrival he immediately began to expand his network\nof hacked computers. During the week Leha managed to get access to n computers\nthroughout the town. Incidentally all the computers, which were hacked by\nLeha, lie on the same straight line, due to the reason that there is the only\none straight street in Vi\u010dkopolis. Let's denote the coordinate system on this\nstreet. Besides let's number all the hacked computers with integers from 1 to\nn. So the i-th hacked computer is located at the point xi. Moreover the\ncoordinates of all computers are distinct. Leha is determined to have a little\nrest after a hard week. Therefore he is going to invite his friend Noora to a\nrestaurant. However the girl agrees to go on a date with the only one\ncondition: Leha have to solve a simple task. Leha should calculate a sum of\nF(a) for all a, where a is a non-empty subset of the set, that consists of all\nhacked computers. Formally, let's denote A the set of all integers from 1 to\nn. Noora asks the hacker to find value of the expression . Here F(a) is\ncalculated as the maximum among the distances between all pairs of computers\nfrom the set a. Formally, . Since the required sum can be quite large Noora\nasks to find it modulo 10^9 + 7. Though, Leha is too tired. Consequently he is\nnot able to solve this task. Help the hacker to attend a date. Input The first\nline contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5) denoting the number of hacked\ncomputers. The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ..., xn (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 10^9)\ndenoting the coordinates of hacked computers. It is guaranteed that all xi are\ndistinct. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the required sum modulo 10^9 + 7.\nExamples Input 2 4 7 Output 3 Input 3 4 3 1 Output 9 Note There are three non-\nempty subsets in the first sample test:, and . The first and the second subset\nincrease the sum by 0 and the third subset increases the sum by 7 - 4 = 3. In\ntotal the answer is 0 + 0 + 3 = 3. There are seven non-empty subsets in the\nsecond sample test. Among them only the following subsets increase the answer:\n, , , . In total the sum is (4 - 3) + (4 - 1) + (3 - 1) + (4 - 1) = 9.\n\n",
