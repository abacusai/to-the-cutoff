        "description": "You talked to Polycarp and asked him a question. You know that when he wants\nto answer \"yes\", he repeats Yes many times in a row. Because of the noise, you\nonly heard part of the answer \u2014 some substring of it. That is, if he answered\nYesYes, then you could hear esY, YesYes, sYes, e, but you couldn't Yess, YES\nor se. Determine if it is true that the given string \n    s\n is a substring of\nYesYesYes... (Yes repeated many times in a row). Input The first line of input\ndata contains the singular \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases in the test. Each test case is described by a single string of\nLatin letters \n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 |s| \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the part of Polycarp's\nanswer that you heard, where \n    |s|\n \u2014 is the length of the string \n    s\n.\nOutput Output \n    t\n lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding\ntest case. As an answer, output \"YES\" if the specified string \n    s\n is a\nsubstring of the string YesYesYes...Yes (the number of words Yes is\narbitrary), and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for\nexample, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be recognized as a\npositive answer). Example Input 12 YES esYes codeforces es se YesY\nesYesYesYesYesYesYe seY Yess sY o Yes Output NO YES NO YES NO YES YES NO NO\nYES NO YES\n\n",
