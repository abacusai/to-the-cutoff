        "description": "You are given four integers \n    n\n, \n    c_0\n, \n    c_1\n and \n    h\n and a\nbinary string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n. A binary string is a string\nconsisting of characters \n    0\n and \n    1\n. You can change any character of\nthe string \n    s\n (the string should be still binary after the change). You\nshould pay \n    h\n coins for each change. After some changes (possibly zero)\nyou want to buy the string. To buy the string you should buy all its\ncharacters. To buy the character \n    0\n you should pay \n    c_0\n coins, to\nbuy the character \n    1\n you should pay \n    c_1\n coins. Find the minimum\nnumber of coins needed to buy the string. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Next \n    2t\n lines contain descriptions of test cases. The first line\nof the description of each test case contains four integers \n    n\n,\n\n    c_0\n, \n    c_1\n, \n    h\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, c_0, c_1, h \n    \u2264\n    1000\n). The second line of the description of each test case contains the\nbinary string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n. Output For each test case print a\nsingle integer \u2014 the minimum number of coins needed to buy the string. Example\nInput 6 3 1 1 1 100 5 10 100 1 01010 5 10 1 1 11111 5 1 10 1 11111 12 2 1 10\n101110110101 2 100 1 10 00 Output 3 52 5 10 16 22 Note In the first test case,\nyou can buy all characters and pay \n    3\n coins, because both characters\n\n    0\n and \n    1\n costs \n    1\n coin. In the second test case, you can\nfirstly change \n    2\n-nd and \n    4\n-th symbols of the string from \n    1\n to\n\n    0\n and pay \n    2\n coins for that. Your string will be \n    00000\n. After\nthat, you can buy the string and pay \n    5 \n    \u00b7 10 = 50\n coins for that.\nThe total number of coins paid will be \n    2 + 50 = 52\n.\n\n",
