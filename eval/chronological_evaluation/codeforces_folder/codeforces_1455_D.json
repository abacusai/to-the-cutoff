        "description": "You are given a sequence \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n, and an integer \n    x\n. Your task is to make the sequence\n\n    a\n sorted (it is considered sorted if the condition \n    a_1 \n    \u2264 a_2\n    \n    \u2264 a_3 \n    \u2264\n    \u2026\n    \u2264 a_n\n holds). To make the sequence sorted, you\nmay perform the following operation any number of times you want (possibly\nzero): choose an integer \n    i\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n and \n    a_i\n    > x\n, and swap the values of \n    a_i\n and \n    x\n. For example, if \n    a =\n    [0, 2, 3, 5, 4]\n, \n    x = 1\n, the following sequence of operations is\npossible: choose \n    i = 2\n (it is possible since \n    a_2 > x\n), then \n    a =\n    [0, 1, 3, 5, 4]\n, \n    x = 2\n; choose \n    i = 3\n (it is possible since\n\n    a_3 > x\n), then \n    a = [0, 1, 2, 5, 4]\n, \n    x = 3\n; choose \n    i =\n    4\n (it is possible since \n    a_4 > x\n), then \n    a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n,\n\n    x = 5\n. Calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform so\nthat \n    a\n becomes sorted, or report that it is impossible. Input The first\nline contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 500\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 500\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264\n    500\n) \u2014 the number of elements in the sequence and the initial value of\n\n    x\n. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n, ...,\n\n    a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 500\n). The sum of values of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases in the input does not exceed \n    500\n. Output For each test case,\nprint one integer \u2014 the minimum number of operations you have to perform to\nmake \n    a\n sorted, or \n    -1\n, if it is impossible.
