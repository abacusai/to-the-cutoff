        "description": "You found a painting on a canvas of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n. The canvas can be\nrepresented as a grid with \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n columns. Each cell has\nsome color. Cell \n    (i, j)\n has color \n    c_i,j\n. Near the painting you\nalso found a brush in the shape of a \n    2 \n    \u00d7 2\n square, so the canvas\nwas surely painted in the following way: initially, no cell was painted. Then,\nthe following painting operation has been performed some number of times:\nChoose two integers \n    i\n and \n    j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i < n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 j <\n    m\n) and some color \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 nm\n). Paint cells \n    (i,\n    j)\n, \n    (i + 1, j)\n, \n    (i, j + 1)\n, \n    (i + 1, j + 1)\n in color\n\n    k\n. All cells must be painted at least once. A cell can be painted\nmultiple times. In this case, its final color will be the last one. Find any\nsequence of at most \n    nm\n operations that could have led to the painting\nyou found or state that it's impossible. Input The first line of input\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014\nthe dimensions of the canvas. On the \n    i\n-th of the next \n    n\n lines of\ninput, there will be \n    m\n integers. The \n    j\n-th of them is \n    a_i,j\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i,j\n    \u2264 nm\n) \u2014 the color of cell \n    (i, j)\n. Output If\nthere is no solution, print a single integer \n    -1\n. Otherwise, on the first\nline, print one integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 nm\n) \u2014 the number of\noperations. Next, print the operations in order. On the \n    k\n-th of the next\n\n    q\n lines, print three integers \n    i\n, \n    j\n, \n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i <\n    n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 j < m\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 c \n    \u2264 nm\n) \u2014 the description of the\n\n    k\n-th operation. If there are multiple solutions, print any. Examples\nInput 4 4 5 5 3 3 1 1 5 3 2 2 5 4 2 2 4 4 Output 6 1 3 3 3 3 4 2 2 5 1 1 5 2 1\n1 3 1 2 Input 3 4 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 1 2 2 1 1 Output -1 Note In the first test\ncase, the solution is not unique. Here's one of them: In the second test case,\nthere is no way one could obtain the given painting, thus the answer is\n\n    -1\n.\n\n",
