        "description": "Madoka finally found the administrator password for her computer. Her father\nis a well-known popularizer of mathematics, so the password is the answer to\nthe following problem. Find the maximum decimal number without zeroes and with\nno equal digits in a row, such that the sum of its digits is \n    n\n. Madoka\nis too tired of math to solve it herself, so help her to solve this problem!\nInput Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nDescription of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case\ncontains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the required sum of\nthe digits. Output For each test case print the maximum number you can obtain.\nExample Input 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 1 2 21 121 212 Note The only numbers with the\nsum of digits equal to \n    2\n without zeros are \n    2\n and \n    11\n. But the\nlast one has two ones in a row, so it's not valid. That's why the answer is\n\n    2\n. The only numbers with the sum of digits equal to \n    3\n without\nzeros are \n    111\n, \n    12\n, \n    21\n, and \n    3\n. The first one has\n\n    2\n ones in a row, so it's not valid. So the maximum valid number is\n\n    21\n. The only numbers with the sum of digits equals to \n    4\n without\nzeros are \n    1111\n, \n    211\n, \n    121\n, \n    112\n, \n    13\n, \n    31\n,\n\n    22\n, and \n    4\n. Numbers \n    1111\n, \n    211\n, \n    112\n, \n    22\n\naren't valid, because they have some identical digits in a row. So the maximum\nvalid number is \n    121\n.\n\n",
