        "description": "You are given two sets of integers: \n    A\n and \n    B\n. You need to output\nthe sum of elements in the set \n    C = \n    \n    x | x = a \n    \u2295 b, a \n    \u2208 A, b\n    \n    \u2208 B\n modulo \n    998244353\n, where \n    \u2295\n denotes the\nbitwise XOR operation. Each number should be counted only once. For example,\nif \n    A = \n    \n    2, 3\n and \n    B = \n    \n    2, 3\n you should count\ninteger \n    1\n only once, despite the fact that you can get it as \n    3\n    \n    \u2295 2\n and as \n    2 \n    \u2295 3\n. So the answer for this case is equal\nto \n    1 + 0 = 1\n. Let's call a segment \n    [l; r]\n a set of integers\n\n    l, l+1, \n    \u2026, r\n. The set \n    A\n is given as a union of\n\n    n_A\n segments, the set \n    B\n is given as a union of \n    n_B\n segments.\nInput The first line contains a single integer \n    n_A\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n_A \n    \u2264\n    100\n). The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    n_A\n lines contains two integers\n\n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 10^18\n),\ndescribing a segment of values of set \n    A\n. The next line contains a single\ninteger \n    n_B\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n_B \n    \u2264 100\n). The \n    i\n-th of the next\n\n    n_B\n lines contains two integers \n    l_j\n and \n    r_j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_j\n    \n    \u2264 r_j \n    \u2264 10^18\n), describing a segment of values of set \n    B\n.\nNote that segments in both sets may intersect. Output Print one integer \u2014 the\nsum of all elements in set \n    C = \n    \n    x | x = a \n    \u2295 b, a \n    \u2208 A, b\n    \n    \u2208 B\n modulo \n    998244353\n. Examples Input 2 3 5 5 8 3 1 2 1 9 2 9\nOutput 112 Input 1 1 9 2 2 4 2 10 Output 120 Note In the second example, we\ncan discover that the set \n    C = \n    \n    0,1,\n    \u2026,15\n, which means that\nall numbers between \n    0\n and \n    15\n can be represented as \n    a \n    \u2295\n    b\n.\n\n",
