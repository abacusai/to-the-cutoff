        "description": "Dr. Bruce Banner hates his enemies (like others don't). As we all know, he can\nbarely talk when he turns into the incredible Hulk. That's why he asked you to\nhelp him to express his feelings. Hulk likes the Inception so much, and like\nthat his feelings are complicated. They have n layers. The first layer is\nhate, second one is love, third one is hate and so on... For example if n = 1,\nthen his feeling is \"I hate it\" or if n = 2 it's \"I hate that I love it\", and\nif n = 3 it's \"I hate that I love that I hate it\" and so on. Please help Dr.\nBanner. Input The only line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n100) \u2014 the number of layers of love and hate. Output Print Dr.Banner's feeling\nin one line. Examples Input 1 Output I hate it Input 2 Output I hate that I\nlove it Input 3 Output I hate that I love that I hate it\n\n",
