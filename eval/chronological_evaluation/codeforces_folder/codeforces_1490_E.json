        "description": "A championship is held in Berland, in which \n    n\n players participate. The\nplayer with the number \n    i\n has \n    a_i\n (\n    a_i \n    \u2265 1\n) tokens. The\nchampionship consists of \n    n-1\n games, which are played according to the\nfollowing rules: in each game, two random players with non-zero tokens are\nselected; the player with more tokens is considered the winner of the game (in\ncase of a tie, the winner is chosen randomly); the winning player takes all of\nthe loser's tokens; The last player with non-zero tokens is the winner of the\nchampionship. All random decisions that are made during the championship are\nmade equally probable and independently. For example, if \n    n=4\n, \n    a = [1,\n    2, 4, 3]\n, then one of the options for the game (there could be other\noptions) is: during the first game, the first and fourth players were\nselected. The fourth player has more tokens, so he takes the first player's\ntokens. Now \n    a = [0, 2, 4, 4]\n; during the second game, the fourth and\nthird players were selected. They have the same number of tokens, but in a\nrandom way, the third player is the winner. Now \n    a = [0, 2, 8, 0]\n; during\nthe third game, the second and third players were selected. The third player\nhas more tokens, so he takes the second player's tokens. Now \n    a = [0, 0, 10,\n    0]\n; the third player is declared the winner of the championship.\nChampionship winners will receive personalized prizes. Therefore, the judges\nwant to know in advance which players have a chance of winning, i.e have a\nnon-zero probability of winning the championship. You have been asked to find\nall such players. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases\nfollow. The first line of each test case consists of one positive integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of players in the\nchampionship. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n positive\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of tokens the players have. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n\nover all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test\ncase, print the number of players who have a nonzero probability of winning\nthe championship. On the next line print the numbers of these players in\nincreasing order. Players are numbered starting from one in the order in which\nthey appear in the input. Example Input 2 4 1 2 4 3 5 1 1 1 1 1 Output 3 2 3 4\n5 1 2 3 4 5\n\n",
