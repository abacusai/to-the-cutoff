        "description": "The derby between Milan and Inter is happening soon, and you have been chosen\nas the assistant referee for the match, also known as linesman. Your task is\nto move along the touch-line, namely the side of the field, always looking\nvery carefully at the match to check for offside positions and other offences.\nFootball is an extremely serious matter in Italy, and thus it is fundamental\nthat you keep very close track of the ball for as much time as possible. This\nmeans that you want to maximise the number of kicks which you monitor closely.\nYou are able to monitor closely a kick if, when it happens, you are in the\nposition along the touch-line with minimum distance from the place where the\nkick happens. Fortunately, expert analysts have been able to accurately\npredict all the kicks which will occur during the game. That is, you have been\ngiven two lists of integers, \n    t_1, \n    \u2026, t_n\n and \n    a_1, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n, indicating that \n    t_i\n seconds after the beginning of the match the\nball will be kicked and you can monitor closely such kick if you are at the\nposition \n    a_i\n along the touch-line. At the beginning of the game you\nstart at position \n    0\n and the maximum speed at which you can walk along\nthe touch-line is \n    v\n units per second (i.e., you can change your position\nby at most \n    v\n each second). What is the maximum number of kicks that you\ncan monitor closely? Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    v\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 v \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014\nthe number of kicks that will take place and your maximum speed. The second\nline contains \n    n\n integers \n    t_1, \n    \u2026, t_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) \u2014 the times of the kicks in the match. The sequence of times is\nguaranteed to be strictly increasing, i.e., \n    t_1 < t_2 < \n    \u22ef < t_n\n.\nThe third line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    -10^9\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the positions along the touch-line where you have\nto be to monitor closely each kick. Output Print the maximum number of kicks\nthat you can monitor closely. Examples Input 3 2 5 10 15 7 17 29 Output 2\nInput 5 1 5 7 8 11 13 3 3 -2 -2 4 Output 3 Input 1 2 3 7 Output 0 Note In the\nfirst sample, it is possible to move to the right at maximum speed for the\nfirst \n    3.5\n seconds and stay at position \n    7\n until the first kick\nhappens, and then immediately move right also at maximum speed to watch the\nsecond kick at position \n    17\n. There is no way to monitor closely the third\nkick after the second kick, so at most \n    2\n kicks can be seen.\n\n",
