        "description": "Asterix, Obelix and their temporary buddies Suffix and Prefix has finally\nfound the Harmony temple. However, its doors were firmly locked and even\nObelix had no luck opening them. A little later they found a string s, carved\non a rock below the temple's gates. Asterix supposed that that's the password\nthat opens the temple and read the string aloud. However, nothing happened.\nThen Asterix supposed that a password is some substring t of the string s.\nPrefix supposed that the substring t is the beginning of the string s; Suffix\nsupposed that the substring t should be the end of the string s; and Obelix\nsupposed that t should be located somewhere inside the string s, that is, t is\nneither its beginning, nor its end. Asterix chose the substring t so as to\nplease all his companions. Besides, from all acceptable variants Asterix chose\nthe longest one (as Asterix loves long strings). When Asterix read the\nsubstring t aloud, the temple doors opened. You know the string s. Find the\nsubstring t or determine that such substring does not exist and all that's\nbeen written above is just a nice legend. Input You are given the string s\nwhose length can vary from 1 to 10^6 (inclusive), consisting of small Latin\nletters. Output Print the string t. If a suitable t string does not exist,\nthen print \"Just a legend\" without the quotes. Examples Input fixprefixsuffix\nOutput fix Input abcdabc Output Just a legend\n\n",
