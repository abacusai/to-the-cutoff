        "description": "Vasya has been playing Plane of Tanks with his friends the whole year. Now it\nis time to divide the participants into several categories depending on their\nresults. A player is given a non-negative integer number of points in each\nround of the Plane of Tanks. Vasya wrote results for each round of the last\nyear. He has n records in total. In order to determine a player's category\nconsider the best result obtained by the player and the best results of other\nplayers. The player belongs to category: \"noob\" \u2014 if more than 50\nhave better results; \"random\" \u2014 if his result is not worse than the result\nthat 50\n\"average\" \u2014 if his result is not worse than the result that 80\nhave, but more than 10\nresult is not worse than the result that 90\nof players have better results; \"pro\" \u2014 if his result is not worse than the\nresult that 99\nhimself is taken into account. That means that if two players played the game\nand the first one gained 100 points and the second one 1000 points, then the\nfirst player's result is not worse than the result that 50\nand the second one is not worse than the result that 100\nVasya gave you the last year Plane of Tanks results. Help Vasya determine each\nplayer's category. Input The first line contains the only integer number n (1\n\u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 a number of records with the players' results. Each of the next\nn lines contains a player's name and the amount of points, obtained by the\nplayer for the round, separated with a space. The name contains not less than\n1 and no more than 10 characters. The name consists of lowercase Latin letters\nonly. It is guaranteed that any two different players have different names.\nThe amount of points, obtained by the player for the round, is a non-negative\ninteger number and does not exceed 1000. Output Print on the first line the\nnumber m \u2014 the number of players, who participated in one round at least. Each\none of the next m lines should contain a player name and a category he belongs\nto, separated with space. Category can be one of the following: \"noob\",\n\"random\", \"average\", \"hardcore\" or \"pro\" (without quotes). The name of each\nplayer should be printed only once. Player names with respective categories\ncan be printed in an arbitrary order. Examples Input 5 vasya 100 vasya 200\nartem 100 kolya 200 igor 250 Output 4 artem noob igor pro kolya random vasya\nrandom Input 3 vasya 200 kolya 1000 vasya 1000 Output 2 kolya pro vasya pro\nNote In the first example the best result, obtained by artem is not worse than\nthe result that 25\ncategory \"noob\". vasya and kolya have best results not worse than the results\nthat 75\n\"random\". igor has best result not worse than the result that 100\nhave (all other players and himself), so he belongs to category \"pro\". In the\nsecond example both players have the same amount of points, so they have\nresults not worse than 100\n\n",
