        "description": "You are given an integer \n    n\n and an array \n    a\n of length \n    n-1\n\nwhose elements are either \n    0\n or \n    1\n. Let us define the value of a\npermutation\n    ^\n    \u2020\n \n    p\n of length \n    m-1\n (\n    m \n    \u2264 n\n) by\nthe following process. Let \n    G\n be a graph of \n    m\n vertices labeled from\n\n    1\n to \n    m\n that does not contain any edges. For each \n    i\n from\n\n    1\n to \n    m-1\n, perform the following operations: define \n    u\n and\n\n    v\n as the (unique) vertices in the weakly connected\ncomponents\n    ^\n containing vertices \n    p_i\n and \n    p_i+1\n\nrespectively with only incoming edges\n    ^\n    \u2020\n    \u2020\n; in graph\n\n    G\n, add a directed edge from vertex \n    v\n to \n    u\n if\n\n    a_p_i=0\n, otherwise add a directed edge from vertex \n    u\n to \n    v\n\n(if \n    a_p_i=1\n). Note that after each step, it can be proven that each\nweakly connected component of \n    G\n has a unique vertex with only incoming\nedges.Then, the value of \n    p\n is the number of incoming edges of vertex\n\n    1\n of \n    G\n. For each \n    k\n from \n    1\n to \n    n-1\n, find the sum\nof values of all \n    k!\n permutations of length \n    k\n. Since this value can\nbe big, you are only required to compute this value under modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Operations when \n    n=3\n, \n    a=[0,1]\n and\n\n    p=[1,2]\n \n    ^\n    \u2020\n A permutation of length \n    n\n is an array\nconsisting of \n    n\n distinct integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n in arbitrary\norder. For example, \n    [2,3,1,5,4]\n is a permutation, but \n    [1,2,2]\n is\nnot a permutation (\n    2\n appears twice in the array), and \n    [1,3,4]\n is\nalso not a permutation (\n    n=3\n but there is \n    4\n in the array).\n\n    ^\n The weakly connected components of a directed graph is the\nsame as the components of the undirected version of the graph. Formally, for\ndirected graph \n    G\n, define a graph \n    H\n where for all edges \n    a \n    \u2192\n    b\n in \n    G\n, you add an undirected edge \n    a \n    \u2194 b\n in\n\n    H\n. Then the weakly connected components of \n    G\n are the components of\n\n    H\n. \n    ^\n    \u2020\n    \u2020\n Note that a vertex that has no edges is\nconsidered to have only incoming edges. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a\nsingle integer \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The second line\nof each test case contains \n    n-1\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n-1\n (\n    a_i\n is \n    0\n or \n    1\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case, output \n    n-1\n integers in a line, the \n    i\n-th integer\nshould represent the answer when \n    k=i\n, under modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Example Input 2 3 0 0 9 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 Output 1 3 1\n2 7 31 167 1002 7314 60612 Note Consider the first test case. When \n    k=1\n,\nthere is only \n    1\n permutation \n    p\n. When \n    p=[1]\n, we will add a\nsingle edge from vertex \n    2\n to \n    1\n. Vertex \n    1\n will have \n    1\n\nincoming edge. So the value of \n    [1]\n is \n    1\n. Therefore when \n    k=1\n,\nthe answer is \n    1\n. When \n    k=2\n, there are \n    2\n permutations \n    p\n.\nWhen \n    p=[1,2]\n, we will add an edge from vertex \n    2\n to \n    1\n and an\nedge from \n    3\n to \n    1\n. Vertex \n    1\n will have \n    2\n incoming edges.\nSo the value of \n    [1,2]\n is \n    2\n. When \n    p=[2,1]\n, we will add an\nedge from vertex \n    3\n to \n    2\n and an edge from \n    2\n to \n    1\n.\nVertex \n    1\n will have \n    1\n incoming edge. So the value of \n    [2,1]\n is\n\n    1\n. Therefore when \n    k=2\n, the answer is \n    2+1=3\n.\n\n",
