        "description": "We play a game with \n    n\n dots on a number line. The initial coordinate of\nthe \n    i\n-th dot is \n    x_i\n. These coordinates are distinct. Every dot\nstarts moving simultaneously with the same constant speed. Each dot moves in\nthe direction of the closest dot (different from itself) until it meets\nanother dot. In the case of a tie, it goes to the left. Two dots meet if they\nare in the same coordinate, after that, they stop moving. After enough time,\nevery dot stops moving. The result of a game is the number of distinct\ncoordinates where the dots stop. Because this game is too easy, calculate the\nsum of results when we play the game for every subset of the given \n    n\n\ndots that has at least two dots. As the result can be very large, print the\nsum modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Input The first line contains one integer \n    n\n\n(\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3000\n). The next line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_1 < x_2 < \n    \u2026 < x_n \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n), where \n    x_i\n represents the initial coordinate of \n    i\n-th dot.\nOutput Print the sum of results modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Examples Input 4 1 2 4 6\nOutput 11 Input 5 1 3 5 11 15 Output 30 Note In the first example, for a\nsubset of size \n    2\n, two dots move toward each other, so there is \n    1\n\ncoordinate where the dots stop. For a subset of size \n    3\n, the first dot\nand third dot move toward the second dot, so there is \n    1\n coordinate where\nthe dots stop no matter the direction where the second dot moves. For \n    [1,\n    2, 4, 6]\n, the first and second dots move toward each other. For the third\ndot, initially, the second dot and the fourth dot are the closest dots. Since\nit is a tie, the third dot moves left. The fourth dot also moves left. So\nthere is \n    1\n coordinate where the dots stop, which is \n    1.5\n. Because\nthere are \n    6\n subsets of size \n    2\n, \n    4\n subsets of size \n    3\n and\none subset of size \n    4\n, the answer is \n    6 \n    \u00b7 1 + 4 \n    \u00b7 1 + 1 =\n    11\n. In the second example, for a subset of size \n    5\n (when there are\ndots at \n    1\n, \n    3\n, \n    5\n, \n    11\n, \n    15\n), dots at \n    1\n and\n\n    11\n will move right and dots at \n    3\n, \n    5\n, \n    15\n will move\nleft. Dots at \n    1\n, \n    3\n, \n    5\n will eventually meet at \n    2\n, and\ndots at \n    11\n and \n    15\n will meet at \n    13\n, so there are \n    2\n\ncoordinates where the dots stop.\n\n",
