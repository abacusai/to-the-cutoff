        "name": "Parking Lot",
        "description": "To quickly hire highly skilled specialists one of the new IT City companies\nmade an unprecedented move. Every employee was granted a car, and an employee\ncan choose one of four different car makes. The parking lot before the office\nconsists of one line of (2n - 2) parking spaces. Unfortunately the total\nnumber of cars is greater than the parking lot capacity. Furthermore even\namount of cars of each make is greater than the amount of parking spaces!\nThat's why there are no free spaces on the parking lot ever. Looking on the\nstraight line of cars the company CEO thought that parking lot would be more\nbeautiful if it contained exactly n successive cars of the same make. Help the\nCEO determine the number of ways to fill the parking lot this way. Input The\nonly line of the input contains one integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 30) \u2014 the amount of\nsuccessive cars of the same make. Output Output one integer \u2014 the number of\nways to fill the parking lot by cars of four makes using the described way.\nExamples Input 3 Output 24 Note Let's denote car makes in the following way: A\n\u2014 Aston Martin, B \u2014 Bentley, M \u2014 Mercedes-Maybach, Z \u2014 Zaporozhets. For n = 3\nthere are the following appropriate ways to fill the parking lot: AAAB AAAM\nAAAZ ABBB AMMM AZZZ BBBA BBBM BBBZ BAAA BMMM BZZZ MMMA MMMB MMMZ MAAA MBBB\nMZZZ ZZZA ZZZB ZZZM ZAAA ZBBB ZMMM Originally it was planned to grant sport\ncars of Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati and Bugatti makes but this idea was\nrenounced because it is impossible to drive these cars having small road\nclearance on the worn-down roads of IT City.\n\n",
