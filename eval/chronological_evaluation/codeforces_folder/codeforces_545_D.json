        "description": "Little girl Susie went shopping with her mom and she wondered how to improve\nservice quality. There are n people in the queue. For each person we know time\nti needed to serve him. A person will be disappointed if the time he waits is\nmore than the time needed to serve him. The time a person waits is the total\ntime when all the people who stand in the queue in front of him are served.\nSusie thought that if we swap some people in the queue, then we can decrease\nthe number of people who are disappointed. Help Susie find out what is the\nmaximum number of not disappointed people can be achieved by swapping people\nin the queue. Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The next\nline contains n integers ti (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 10^9), separated by spaces. Output Print\na single number \u2014 the maximum number of not disappointed people in the queue.\nExamples Input 5 15 2 1 5 3 Output 4 Note Value 4 is achieved at such an\narrangement, for example: 1, 2, 3, 5, 15. Thus, you can make everything feel\nnot disappointed except for the person with time 5.\n\n",
