        "description": "One beautiful day Vasily the bear painted 2m circles of the same radius R on a\ncoordinate plane. Circles with numbers from 1 to m had centers at points (2R -\nR, 0), (4R - R, 0), ..., (2Rm - R, 0), respectively. Circles with numbers from\nm + 1 to 2m had centers at points (2R - R, 2R), (4R - R, 2R), ..., (2Rm - R,\n2R), respectively. Naturally, the bear painted the circles for a simple\nexperiment with a fly. The experiment continued for m^2 days. Each day of the\nexperiment got its own unique number from 0 to m^2 - 1, inclusive. On the day\nnumber i the following things happened: The fly arrived at the coordinate\nplane at the center of the circle with number ( is the result of dividing\nnumber x by number y, rounded down to an integer). The fly went along the\ncoordinate plane to the center of the circle number ( is the remainder after\ndividing number x by number y). The bear noticed that the fly went from the\ncenter of circle v to the center of circle u along the shortest path with all\npoints lying on the border or inside at least one of the 2m circles. After the\nfly reached the center of circle u, it flew away in an unknown direction. Help\nVasily, count the average distance the fly went along the coordinate plane\nduring each of these m^2 days. Input The first line contains two integers m, R\n(1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 R \u2264 10). Output In a single line print a single real number\n\u2014 the answer to the problem. The answer will be considered correct if its\nabsolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^-6. Examples Input 1 1 Output\n2.0000000000 Input 2 2 Output 5.4142135624 Note Figure to the second sample\n\n",
