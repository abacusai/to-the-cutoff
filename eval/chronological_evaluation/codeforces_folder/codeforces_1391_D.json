        "description": "A binary matrix is called good if every even length square sub-matrix has an\nodd number of ones. Given a binary matrix \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n rows\nand \n    m\n columns, determine the minimum number of cells you need to change\nto make it good, or report that there is no way to make it good at all. All\nthe terms above have their usual meanings \u2014 refer to the Notes section for\ntheir formal definitions. Input The first line of input contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^6\n and \n    n\n    \u00b7 m\n    \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number of rows and columns in \n    a\n, respectively. The\nfollowing \n    n\n lines each contain \n    m\n characters, each of which is one\nof 0 and 1. If the \n    j\n-th character on the \n    i\n-th line is 1, then\n\n    a_i,j = 1\n. Similarly, if the \n    j\n-th character on the \n    i\n-th\nline is 0, then \n    a_i,j = 0\n. Output Output the minimum number of cells\nyou need to change to make \n    a\n good, or output \n    -1\n if it's not\npossible at all. Examples Input 3 3 101 001 110 Output 2 Input 7 15\n000100001010010 100111010110001 101101111100100 010000111111010\n111010010100001 000011001111101 111111011010011 Output -1 Note In the first\ncase, changing \n    a_1,1\n to \n    0\n and \n    a_2,2\n to \n    1\n is\nenough. You can verify that there is no way to make the matrix in the second\ncase good. Some definitions \u2014 A binary matrix is one in which every element is\neither \n    1\n or \n    0\n. A sub-matrix is described by \n    4\n parameters \u2014\n\n    r_1\n, \n    r_2\n, \n    c_1\n, and \n    c_2\n; here, \n    1 \n    \u2264 r_1 \n    \u2264\n    r_2 \n    \u2264 n\n and \n    1 \n    \u2264 c_1 \n    \u2264 c_2 \n    \u2264 m\n. This sub-matrix\ncontains all elements \n    a_i,j\n that satisfy both \n    r_1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    r_2\n and \n    c_1 \n    \u2264 j \n    \u2264 c_2\n. A sub-matrix is, further, called an\neven length square if \n    r_2-r_1 = c_2-c_1\n and \n    r_2-r_1+1\n is divisible\nby \n    2\n.\n\n",
