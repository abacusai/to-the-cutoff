        "description": "Ildar took a band (a thin strip of cloth) and colored it. Formally, the band\nhas \n    n\n cells, each of them is colored into one of \n    26\n colors, so we\ncan denote each color with one of the lowercase letters of English alphabet.\nIldar decided to take some segment of the band \n    [l, r]\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l\n    \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n) he likes and cut it from the band. So he will create a new\nband that can be represented as a string \n    t = s_l s_l+1\n    \u2026 s_r\n.\nAfter that Ildar will play the following game: he cuts the band \n    t\n into\nsome new bands and counts the number of different bands among them. Formally,\nIldar chooses \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 |t|\n indexes \n    1 \n    \u2264 i_1 < i_2 <\n    \n    \u2026 < i_k = |t|\n and cuts \n    t\n to \n    k\n bands-strings \n    t_1 t_2\n    \n    \u2026 t_i_1, t_i_1 + 1\n    \u2026 t_i_2, \n    \u2026, t_i_k-1 + 1\n    \u2026 t_i_k\n and counts the number of different bands among them. He\nwants to know the minimal possible number of different bands he can get under\nthe constraint that at least one band repeats at least two times. The result\nof the game is this number. If it is impossible to cut \n    t\n in such a way,\nthe result of the game is -1. Unfortunately Ildar hasn't yet decided which\nsegment he likes, but he has \n    q\n segments-candidates \n    [l_1, r_1]\n,\n\n    [l_2, r_2]\n, ..., \n    [l_q, r_q]\n. Your task is to calculate the result\nof the game for each of them. Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 200\n     000\n) \u2014 the length of the band Ildar has.\nThe second line contains a string \n    s\n consisting of \n    n\n lowercase\nEnglish letters \u2014 the band Ildar has. The third line contains a single integer\n\n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 200\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of segments Ildar has\nchosen as candidates. Each of the next \n    q\n lines contains two integer\nintegers \n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 n\n)\ndenoting the ends of the \n    i\n-th segment. Output Output \n    q\n lines,\nwhere the \n    i\n-th of them should contain the result of the game on the\nsegment \n    [l_i, r_i]\n. Example Input 9 abcabcdce 7 1 6 4 7 5 9 6 9 1 9 3 6\n4 4 Output 1 -1 4 3 2 2 -1 Note Consider the first example. If Ildar chooses\nthe segment \n    [1, 6]\n, he cuts a string \n    t = abcabc\n. If he cuts\n\n    t\n into two bands \n    abc\n and \n    abc\n, the band \n    abc\n repeats two\ntimes and the number of different tapes is \n    1\n. So, the result of this\ngame is \n    1\n. If Ildar chooses the segment \n    [4, 7]\n, he cuts a string\n\n    t = abcd\n. It is impossible to cut this band in such a way that there is\nat least one band repeating at least two times. So, the result of this game is\n\n    -1\n. If Ildar chooses the segment \n    [3, 6]\n, he cuts a string \n    t =\n    cabc\n. If he cuts \n    t\n into three bands \n    c\n, \n    ab\n and \n    c\n,\nthe band \n    c\n repeats two times and the number of different bands is\n\n    2\n. So, the result of this game is \n    2\n.\n\n",
