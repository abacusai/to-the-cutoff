        "name": "Wooden Toy Festival",
        "description": "In a small town, there is a workshop specializing in woodwork. Since the town\nis small, only three carvers work there. Soon, a wooden toy festival is\nplanned in the town. The workshop employees want to prepare for it. They know\nthat \n    n\n people will come to the workshop with a request to make a wooden\ntoy. People are different and may want different toys. For simplicity, let's\ndenote the pattern of the toy that the \n    i\n-th person wants as \n    a_i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Each of the carvers can choose an integer\npattern \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^9\n) in advance, different carvers can\nchoose different patterns. \n    x\n is the integer. During the preparation for\nthe festival, the carvers will perfectly work out the technique of making the\ntoy of the chosen pattern, which will allow them to cut it out of wood\ninstantly. To make a toy of pattern \n    y\n for a carver who has chosen\npattern \n    x\n, it will take \n    |x - y|\n time, because the more the toy\nresembles the one he can make instantly, the faster the carver will cope with\nthe work. On the day of the festival, when the next person comes to the\nworkshop with a request to make a wooden toy, the carvers can choose who will\ntake on the job. At the same time, the carvers are very skilled people and can\nwork on orders for different people simultaneously. Since people don't like to\nwait, the carvers want to choose patterns for preparation in such a way that\nthe maximum waiting time over all people is as small as possible. Output the\nbest maximum waiting time that the carvers can achieve. Input The first line\nof the input contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases. The\nfirst line of a test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of people who will come to the workshop.\nThe second line of a test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, a_3,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the patterns of toys. The sum\nof all \n    n\n values over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n. Output Output \n    t\n numbers, each of which is the answer to the\ncorresponding test case \u2014 the best maximum waiting time that the carvers can\nachieve. Example Input 5 6 1 7 7 9 9 9 6 5 4 2 1 30 60 9 14 19 37 59 1 4 4 98\n73 1 2 6 3 10 1 17 15 11 Output 0 2 13 0 1 Note In the first example, the\ncarvers can choose patterns \n    1\n, \n    7\n, \n    9\n for preparation. In the\nsecond example, the carvers can choose patterns \n    3\n, \n    30\n, \n    60\n\nfor preparation. In the third example, the carvers can choose patterns\n\n    14\n, \n    50\n, \n    85\n for preparation.\n\n",
