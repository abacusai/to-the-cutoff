        "description": "Moamen has an array of \n    n\n distinct integers. He wants to sort that array\nin non-decreasing order by doing the following operations in order exactly\nonce: Split the array into exactly \n    k\n non-empty subarrays such that each\nelement belongs to exactly one subarray. Reorder these subarrays arbitrary.\nMerge the subarrays in their new order. A sequence \n    a\n is a subarray of a\nsequence \n    b\n if \n    a\n can be obtained from \n    b\n by deletion of\nseveral (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several\n(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Can you tell Moamen if there is\na way to sort the array in non-decreasing order using the operations written\nabove? Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 |a_i| \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is\nguaranteed that all numbers are distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    3\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For\neach test case, you should output a single string. If Moamen can sort the\narray in non-decreasing order, output \"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise,\noutput \"NO\" (without quotes). You can print each letter of \"YES\" and \"NO\" in\nany case (upper or lower). Example Input 3 5 4 6 3 4 2 1 4 2 1 -4 0 -2 5 1 1 2\n3 4 5 Output Yes No Yes Note In the first test case, \n    a = [6, 3, 4, 2,\n    1]\n, and \n    k = 4\n, so we can do the operations as follows: Split \n    a\n\ninto \n    [6], [3, 4], [2], [1]\n. Reorder them: \n    [1], [2],\n    [3,4], [6]\n. Merge them: \n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]\n, so now the array is\nsorted. In the second test case, there is no way to sort the array by\nsplitting it into only \n    2\n subarrays. As an example, if we split it into\n\n    [1, -4], [0, -2]\n, we can reorder them into \n    [1, -4],\n    [0, -2]\n or \n    [0, -2], [1, -4]\n. However, after merging\nthe subarrays, it is impossible to get a sorted array.\n\n",
