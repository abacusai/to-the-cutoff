        "description": "You are at the top left cell \n    (1, 1)\n of an \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n labyrinth.\nYour goal is to get to the bottom right cell \n    (n, m)\n. You can only move\nright or down, one cell per step. Moving right from a cell \n    (x, y)\n takes\nyou to the cell \n    (x, y + 1)\n, while moving down takes you to the cell\n\n    (x + 1, y)\n. Some cells of the labyrinth contain rocks. When you move to\na cell with rock, the rock is pushed to the next cell in the direction you're\nmoving. If the next cell contains a rock, it gets pushed further, and so on.\nThe labyrinth is surrounded by impenetrable walls, thus any move that would\nput you or any rock outside of the labyrinth is illegal. Count the number of\ndifferent legal paths you can take from the start to the goal modulo \n    10^9 +\n    7\n. Two paths are considered different if there is at least one cell that is\nvisited in one path, but not visited in the other. Input The first line\ncontains two integers \n    n, m\n \u2014 dimensions of the labyrinth (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n,\n    m \n    \u2264 2000\n). Next \n    n\n lines describe the labyrinth. Each of these\nlines contains \n    m\n characters. The \n    j\n-th character of the \n    i\n-th\nof these lines is equal to \"R\" if the cell \n    (i, j)\n contains a rock, or\n\".\" if the cell \n    (i, j)\n is empty. It is guaranteed that the starting cell\n\n    (1, 1)\n is empty. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of different\nlegal paths from \n    (1, 1)\n to \n    (n, m)\n modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Examples\nInput 1 1 . Output 1 Input 2 3 ... ..R Output 0 Input 4 4 ...R .RR. .RR. R...\nOutput 4 Note In the first sample case we can't (and don't have to) move,\nhence the only path consists of a single cell \n    (1, 1)\n. In the second\nsample case the goal is blocked and is unreachable. Illustrations for the\nthird sample case can be found here:\nhttps://assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1225/index.html\n\n",
