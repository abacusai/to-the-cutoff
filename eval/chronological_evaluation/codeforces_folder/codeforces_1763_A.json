        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n. You can perform the\nfollowing operation several (possibly, zero) times: Choose \n    i\n, \n    j\n,\n\n    b\n: Swap the \n    b\n-th digit in the binary representation of \n    a_i\n\nand \n    a_j\n. Find the maximum possible value of \n    max(a) - \n    min(a)\n.\nIn a binary representation, bits are numbered from right (least significant)\nto left (most significant). Consider that there are an infinite number of\nleading zero bits at the beginning of any binary representation. For example,\nswap the \n    0\n-th bit for \n    4=100_2\n and \n    3=11_2\n will result\n\n    101_2=5\n and \n    10_2=2\n. Swap the \n    2\n-nd bit for \n    4=100_2\n and\n\n    3=11_2\n will result \n    000_2=0_2=0\n and \n    111_2=7\n. Here,\n\n    max(a)\n denotes the maximum element of array \n    a\n and\n\n    min(a)\n denotes the minimum element of array \n    a\n. The binary\nrepresentation of \n    x\n is \n    x\n written in base \n    2\n. For example,\n\n    9\n and \n    6\n written in base \n    2\n are \n    1001\n and \n    110\n,\nrespectively. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 128\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. The first line of each test\ncase contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 512\n) \u2014 the\nlength of array \n    a\n. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i < 1024\n) \u2014 the\nelements of array \n    a\n. It's guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntestcases does not exceed \n    512\n. Output For each testcase, print one\ninteger \u2014 the maximum possible value of \n    max(a) - \n    min(a)\n. Example\nInput 4 3 1 0 1 4 5 5 5 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 7 20 85 100 41 76 49 36 Output 1 0 7 125\nNote In the first example, it can be shown that we do not need to perform any\noperations \u2014 the maximum value of \n    max(a) - \n    min(a)\n is \n    1 - 0 =\n    1\n. In the second example, no operation can change the array \u2014 the maximum\nvalue of \n    max(a) - \n    min(a)\n is \n    5 - 5 = 0\n. In the third example,\ninitially \n    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n, we can perform one operation taking \n    i\n    = 2\n, \n    j = 5\n, \n    b = 1\n. The array now becomes \n    a = [1, 0, 3, 4,\n    7]\n. It can be shown that any further operations do not lead to a better\nanswer \u2014 therefore the answer is \n    max(a) - \n    min(a) = 7 - 0 = 7\n.\n\n",
