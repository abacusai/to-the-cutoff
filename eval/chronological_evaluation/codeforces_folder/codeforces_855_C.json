        "name": "Helga Hufflepuff's Cup",
        "description": "Harry, Ron and Hermione have figured out that Helga Hufflepuff's cup is a\nhorcrux. Through her encounter with Bellatrix Lestrange, Hermione came to know\nthat the cup is present in Bellatrix's family vault in Gringott's Wizarding\nBank. The Wizarding bank is in the form of a tree with total n vaults where\neach vault has some type, denoted by a number between 1 to m. A tree is an\nundirected connected graph with no cycles. The vaults with the highest\nsecurity are of type k, and all vaults of type k have the highest security.\nThere can be at most x vaults of highest security. Also, if a vault is of the\nhighest security, its adjacent vaults are guaranteed to not be of the highest\nsecurity and their type is guaranteed to be less than k. Harry wants to\nconsider every possibility so that he can easily find the best path to reach\nBellatrix's vault. So, you have to tell him, given the tree structure of\nGringotts, the number of possible ways of giving each vault a type such that\nthe above conditions hold. Input The first line of input contains two space\nseparated integers, n and m \u2014 the number of vaults and the number of different\nvault types possible. (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^9). Each of the next n - 1\nlines contain two space separated integers ui and vi (1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264 n)\nrepresenting the i-th edge, which shows there is a path between the two vaults\nui and vi. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree. The last line of\ninput contains two integers k and x (1 \u2264 k \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 10), the type of the\nhighest security vault and the maximum possible number of vaults of highest\nsecurity. Output Output a single integer, the number of ways of giving each\nvault a type following the conditions modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input 4 2 1 2\n2 3 1 4 1 2 Output 1 Input 3 3 1 2 1 3 2 1 Output 13 Input 3 1 1 2 1 3 1 1\nOutput 0 Note In test case 1, we cannot have any vault of the highest security\nas its type is 1 implying that its adjacent vaults would have to have a vault\ntype less than 1, which is not allowed. Thus, there is only one possible\ncombination, in which all the vaults have type 2.\n\n",
