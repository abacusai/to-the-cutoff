        "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. They are given an array \n    A\n of length\n\n    N\n. The array consists of integers. They are building a sequence\ntogether. In the beginning, the sequence is empty. In one turn a player can\nremove a number from the left or right side of the array and append it to the\nsequence. The rule is that the sequence they are building must be strictly\nincreasing. The winner is the player that makes the last move. Alice is\nplaying first. Given the starting array, under the assumption that they both\nplay optimally, who wins the game? Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    N\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 2*10^5\n) - the length of the array \n    A\n.\nThe second line contains \n    N\n integers \n    A_1\n, \n    A_2\n,...,\n    A_N\n\n(\n    0 \n    \u2264 A_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) Output The first and only line of output\nconsists of one string, the name of the winner. If Alice won, print \"Alice\",\notherwise, print \"Bob\". Examples Input 1 5 Output Alice Input 3 5 4 5 Output\nAlice Input 6 5 8 2 1 10 9 Output Bob\n\n",
