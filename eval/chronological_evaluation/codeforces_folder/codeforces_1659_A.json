        "description": "Team Red and Team Blue competed in a competitive FPS. Their match was streamed\naround the world. They played a series of \n    n\n matches. In the end, it\nturned out Team Red won \n    r\n times and Team Blue won \n    b\n times. Team\nBlue was less skilled than Team Red, so \n    b\n was strictly less than\n\n    r\n. You missed the stream since you overslept, but you think that the\nmatch must have been neck and neck since so many people watched it. So you\nimagine a string of length \n    n\n where the \n    i\n-th character denotes who\nwon the \n    i\n-th match \u2014 it is R if Team Red won or B if Team Blue won. You\nimagine the string was such that the maximum number of times a team won in a\nrow was as small as possible. For example, in the series of matches RBBRRRB,\nTeam Red won \n    3\n times in a row, which is the maximum. You must find a\nstring satisfying the above conditions. If there are multiple answers, print\nany. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case has a single line\ncontaining three integers \n    n\n, \n    r\n, and \n    b\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    100\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 b < r \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    r+b=n\n). Output For each test\ncase, output a single line containing a string satisfying the given\nconditions. If there are multiple answers, print any. Examples Input 3 7 4 3 6\n5 1 19 13 6 Output RBRBRBR RRRBRR RRBRRBRRBRRBRRBRRBR Input 6 3 2 1 10 6 4 11\n6 5 10 9 1 10 8 2 11 9 2 Output RBR RRBRBRBRBR RBRBRBRBRBR RRRRRBRRRR\nRRRBRRRBRR RRRBRRRBRRR Note The first test case of the first example gives the\noptimal answer for the example in the statement. The maximum number of times a\nteam wins in a row in RBRBRBR is \n    1\n. We cannot minimize it any further.\nThe answer for the second test case of the second example is RRBRBRBRBR. The\nmaximum number of times a team wins in a row is \n    2\n, given by RR at the\nbeginning. We cannot minimize the answer any further.\n\n",
