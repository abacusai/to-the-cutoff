A sequence \n    b\n is a subsequence\nof an array \n    a\n if \n    b\n can be obtained from \n    a\n by deleting some\n(possibly all) elements. The product of an empty subsequence is equal to\n\n    1\n. Input The only line contains the integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n). Output The first line should contain a single integer, the length of\nthe longest subsequence. The second line should contain the elements of the\nsubsequence, in increasing order. If there are multiple solutions, you can\nprint any. Examples Input 5 Output 3 1 2 3 Input 8 Output 4 1 3 5 7 Note In\nthe first example, the product of the elements is \n    6\n which is congruent\nto \n    1\n modulo \n    5\n. The only longer subsequence is \n    [1,2,3,4]\n. Its\nproduct is \n    24\n which is congruent to \n    4\n modulo \n    5\n. Hence, the\nanswer is \n    [1,2,3]\n.\n\n",
