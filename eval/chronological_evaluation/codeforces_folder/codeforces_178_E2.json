        "description": "Offering the ABBYY Cup participants a problem written by the Smart Beaver is\nbecoming a tradition. He proposed the following problem. You are given a\nmonochrome image, that is, an image that is composed of two colors (black and\nwhite). The image is given in raster form, that is, as a matrix of pixels'\ncolors, and the matrix's size coincides with the size of the image. The white\ncolor on the given image corresponds to the background. Also, the image\ncontains several black geometric shapes. It is known that the image can\ncontain only two types of shapes: squares and circles. Your task is to count\nthe number of circles and the number of squares which the given image\ncontains. The squares on the image can be rotated arbitrarily. In addition,\nthe image can possibly contain some noise arranged as follows: each pixel of\nthe original image can change its color to the opposite with the probability\nof 20\nare parallel to the coordinate axes (two circles and three squares). An\nexample of an image that has no noise and the squares are rotated arbitrarily\n(two circles and three squares). An example of an image that has noise and the\nsquares are rotated arbitrarily (one circle and three squares). Input The\nfirst input line contains a single integer n (1000 \u2264 n \u2264 2000), which is the\nlength and the width of the original image. Next n lines describe the matrix\nof colors of the image pixels. The i-th line contains exactly n integers aij\n(0 \u2264 aij \u2264 1), separated by spaces. Value of aij = 0 corresponds to a white\npixel and aij = 1 corresponds to a black one. It is guaranteed that the\nlengths of the sides of the squares and the diameters of the circles in the\nimage are at least 15 pixels, and the distance between any two figures is at\nleast 10 pixels. It is also guaranteed that a human can easily calculate the\nnumber of circles and squares in the original image. The total number of\nfigures in the image doesn't exceed 50. The input limitations for getting 20\npoints are: These test cases have no noise and the sides of the squares are\nparallel to the coordinate axes. The input limitations for getting 50 points\nare: These test cases have no noise, but the squares are rotated arbitrarily.\nThe input limitations for getting 100 points are: These test cases have noise\nand the squares are rotated arbitrarily. Output Print exactly two integers,\nseparated by a single space \u2014 the number of circles and the number of squares\nin the given image, correspondingly.
