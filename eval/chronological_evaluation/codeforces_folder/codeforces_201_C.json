        "description": "You are playing a video game and you have just reached the bonus level, where\nthe only possible goal is to score as many points as possible. Being a\nperfectionist, you've decided that you won't leave this level until you've\ngained the maximum possible number of points there. The bonus level consists\nof n small platforms placed in a line and numbered from 1 to n from left to\nright and (n - 1) bridges connecting adjacent platforms. The bridges between\nthe platforms are very fragile, and for each bridge the number of times one\ncan pass this bridge from one of its ends to the other before it collapses\nforever is known in advance. The player's actions are as follows. First, he\nselects one of the platforms to be the starting position for his hero. After\nthat the player can freely move the hero across the platforms moving by the\nundestroyed bridges. As soon as the hero finds himself on a platform with no\nundestroyed bridge attached to it, the level is automatically ended. The\nnumber of points scored by the player at the end of the level is calculated as\nthe number of transitions made by the hero between the platforms. Note that if\nthe hero started moving by a certain bridge, he has to continue moving in the\nsame direction until he is on a platform. Find how many points you need to\nscore to be sure that nobody will beat your record, and move to the next level\nwith a quiet heart. Input The first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264\n10^5) \u2014 the number of platforms on the bonus level. The second line contains\n(n - 1) integers ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 i < n) \u2014 the number of transitions\nfrom one end to the other that the bridge between platforms i and i + 1 can\nbear. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of points a player\ncan get on the bonus level. Please, do not use the \nwrite 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or\nthe \ngetting 5 points in the sample is starting from platform 3 and consequently\nmoving to platforms 4, 3, 2, 1 and 2. After that the only undestroyed bridge\nis the bridge between platforms 4 and 5, but this bridge is too far from\nplatform 2 where the hero is located now.\n\n",
