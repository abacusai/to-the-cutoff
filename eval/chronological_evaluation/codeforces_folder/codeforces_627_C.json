        "description": "Johnny drives a truck and must deliver a package from his hometown to the\ndistrict center. His hometown is located at point 0 on a number line, and the\ndistrict center is located at the point d. Johnny's truck has a gas tank that\nholds exactly n liters, and his tank is initially full. As he drives, the\ntruck consumes exactly one liter per unit distance traveled. Moreover, there\nare m gas stations located at various points along the way to the district\ncenter. The i-th station is located at the point xi on the number line and\nsells an unlimited amount of fuel at a price of pi dollars per liter. Find the\nminimum cost Johnny must pay for fuel to successfully complete the delivery.\nInput The first line of input contains three space separated integers d, n,\nand m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 d \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the total distance to the district\ncenter, the volume of the gas tank, and the number of gas stations,\nrespectively. Each of the next m lines contains two integers xi, pi (1 \u2264 xi \u2264\nd - 1, 1 \u2264 pi \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the position and cost of gas at the i-th gas station.\nIt is guaranteed that the positions of the gas stations are distinct. Output\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the minimum cost to complete the delivery. If there\nis no way to complete the delivery, print -1. Examples Input 10 4 4 3 5 5 8 6\n3 8 4 Output 22 Input 16 5 2 8 2 5 1 Output -1 Note In the first sample,\nJohnny's truck holds 4 liters. He can drive 3 units to the first gas station,\nbuy 2 liters of gas there (bringing the tank to 3 liters total), drive 3 more\nunits to the third gas station, buy 4 liters there to fill up his tank, and\nthen drive straight to the district center. His total cost is 2\u00b75 + 4\u00b73 = 22\ndollars. In the second sample, there is no way for Johnny to make it to the\ndistrict center, as his tank cannot hold enough gas to take him from the\nlatest gas station to the district center.\n\n",
