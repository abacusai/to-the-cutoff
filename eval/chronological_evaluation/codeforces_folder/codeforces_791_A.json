        "description": "Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger\nthan his brother Bob. Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively.\nIt's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's\nweight. Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while\nBob's weight is doubled after every year. After how many full years will Limak\nbecome strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob? Input The only line of the\ninput contains two integers a and b (1 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 10) \u2014 the weight of Limak and\nthe weight of Bob respectively. Output Print one integer, denoting the integer\nnumber of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.\nExamples Input 4 7 Output 2 Input 4 9 Output 3 Input 1 1 Output 1 Note In the\nfirst sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their\nweights are 4\u00b73 = 12 and 7\u00b72 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while\nthe other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second\nyear weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second\none. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2. In\nthe second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18,\nthen 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3.\nRemember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with\nequal weights. In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the\nfirst year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.\n\n",
