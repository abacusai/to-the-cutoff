        "description": "Harry Potter and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named engaged in a fight to the death once\nagain. This time they are located at opposite ends of the corridor of length\nl. Two opponents simultaneously charge a deadly spell in the enemy. We know\nthat the impulse of Harry's magic spell flies at a speed of p meters per\nsecond, and the impulse of You-Know-Who's magic spell flies at a speed of q\nmeters per second. The impulses are moving through the corridor toward each\nother, and at the time of the collision they turn round and fly back to those\nwho cast them without changing their original speeds. Then, as soon as the\nimpulse gets back to it's caster, the wizard reflects it and sends again\ntowards the enemy, without changing the original speed of the impulse. Since\nHarry has perfectly mastered the basics of magic, he knows that after the\nsecond collision both impulses will disappear, and a powerful explosion will\noccur exactly in the place of their collision. However, the young wizard isn't\ngood at math, so he asks you to calculate the distance from his position to\nthe place of the second meeting of the spell impulses, provided that the\nopponents do not change positions during the whole fight. Input The first line\nof the input contains a single integer l (1 \u2264 l \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the length of the\ncorridor where the fight takes place. The second line contains integer p, the\nthird line contains integer q (1 \u2264 p, q \u2264 500) \u2014 the speeds of magical\nimpulses for Harry Potter and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, respectively. Output\nPrint a single real number \u2014 the distance from the end of the corridor, where\nHarry is located, to the place of the second meeting of the spell impulses.\nYour answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error will\nnot exceed 10^-4. Namely: let's assume that your answer equals a, and the\nanswer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct\nif . Examples Input 100 50 50 Output 50 Input 199 60 40 Output 119.4 Note In\nthe first sample the speeds of the impulses are equal, so both of their\nmeetings occur exactly in the middle of the corridor.\n\n",
