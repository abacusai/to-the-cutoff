        "description": "One very well-known internet resource site (let's call it X) has come up with\na New Year adventure. Specifically, they decided to give ratings to all\nvisitors. There are n users on the site, for each user we know the rating\nvalue he wants to get as a New Year Present. We know that user i wants to get\nat least ai rating units as a present. The X site is administered by very\ncreative and thrifty people. On the one hand, they want to give distinct\nratings and on the other hand, the total sum of the ratings in the present\nmust be as small as possible. Help site X cope with the challenging task of\nrating distribution. Find the optimal distribution. Input The first line\ncontains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of users on the site. The\nnext line contains integer sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9). Output\nPrint a sequence of integers b1, b2, ..., bn. Number bi means that user i gets\nbi of rating as a present. The printed sequence must meet the problem\nconditions. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them.\nExamples Input 3 5 1 1 Output 5 1 2 Input 1 1000000000 Output 1000000000\n\n",
