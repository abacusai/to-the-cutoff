        "description": "Given a permutation \n    p\n of length \n    n\n, find its subsequence \n    s_1\n,\n\n    s_2\n, \n    \u2026\n, \n    s_k\n of length at least \n    2\n such that:\n\n    |s_1-s_2|+|s_2-s_3|+\n    \u2026+|s_k-1-s_k|\n is as big as possible over\nall subsequences of \n    p\n with length at least \n    2\n. Among all such\nsubsequences, choose the one whose length, \n    k\n, is as small as possible.\nIf multiple subsequences satisfy these conditions, you are allowed to find any\nof them. A sequence \n    a\n is a subsequence of an array \n    b\n if \n    a\n\ncan be obtained from \n    b\n by deleting some (possibly, zero or all)\nelements. A permutation of length \n    n\n is an array of length \n    n\n in\nwhich every element from \n    1\n to \n    n\n occurs exactly once. Input The\nfirst line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The\nfirst line of each test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the permutation \n    p\n. The second line of each test\ncase contains \n    n\n integers \n    p_1\n, \n    p_2\n, \n    \u2026\n,\n\n    p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    p_i\n are distinct) \u2014 the elements\nof the permutation \n    p\n. The sum of \n    n\n across the test cases doesn't\nexceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, the first line should contain\nthe length of the found subsequence, \n    k\n. The second line should contain\n\n    s_1\n, \n    s_2\n, \n    \u2026\n, \n    s_k\n \u2014 its elements. If multiple\nsubsequences satisfy these conditions, you are allowed to find any of them.\nExample Input 2 3 3 2 1 4 1 3 4 2 Output 2 3 1 3 1 4 2 Note In the first test\ncase, there are \n    4\n subsequences of length at least \n    2\n: \n    [3,2]\n\nwhich gives us \n    |3-2|=1\n. \n    [3,1]\n which gives us \n    |3-1|=2\n.\n\n    [2,1]\n which gives us \n    |2-1|=1\n. \n    [3,2,1]\n which gives us\n\n    |3-2|+|2-1|=2\n. So the answer is either \n    [3,1]\n or \n    [3,2,1]\n.\nSince we want the subsequence to be as short as possible, the answer is\n\n    [3,1]\n.\n\n",
