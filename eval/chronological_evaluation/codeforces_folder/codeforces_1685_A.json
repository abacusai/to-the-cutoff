        "description": "You are given \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n. Is it possible\nto arrange them on a circle so that each number is strictly greater than both\nits neighbors or strictly smaller than both its neighbors? In other words,\ncheck if there exists a rearrangement \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n of the\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n such that for each \n    i\n from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n at least one of the following conditions holds: \n    b_i-1 < b_i >\n    b_i+1\n \n    b_i-1 > b_i < b_i+1\nTo make sense of the previous formulas\nfor \n    i=1\n and \n    i=n\n, one shall define \n    b_0=b_n\n and\n\n    b_n+1=b_1\n. Input The first line of the input contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 3\n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\nintegers. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). The sum of \n    n\n over\nall test cases doesn't exceed \n    2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case,\nif it is not possible to arrange the numbers on the circle satisfying the\nconditions from the statement, output \n    \n. You can output each\nletter in any case. Otherwise, output \n    \n. In the second\nline, output \n    n\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n, which are a\nrearrangement of \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n and satisfy the conditions from\nthe statement. If there are multiple valid ways to arrange the numbers, you\ncan output any of them. Example Input 4 3 1 1 2 4 1 9 8 4 4 2 0 2 2 6 1 1 1 11\n111 1111 Output NO YES 1 8 4 9 NO YES 1 11 1 111 1 1111 Note It can be shown\nthat there are no valid arrangements for the first and the third test cases.\nIn the second test case, the arrangement \n    [1, 8, 4, 9]\n works. In this\narrangement, \n    1\n and \n    4\n are both smaller than their neighbors, and\n\n    8, 9\n are larger. In the fourth test case, the arrangement \n    [1, 11, 1,\n    111, 1, 1111]\n works. In this arrangement, the three elements equal to\n\n    1\n are smaller than their neighbors, while all other elements are larger\nthan their neighbors.\n\n",
