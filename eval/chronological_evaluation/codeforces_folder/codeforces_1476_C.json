        "description": "You have \n    n\n chains, the \n    i\n-th chain consists of \n    c_i\n vertices.\nVertices in each chain are numbered independently from \n    1\n to \n    c_i\n\nalong the chain. In other words, the \n    i\n-th chain is the undirected graph\nwith \n    c_i\n vertices and \n    (c_i - 1)\n edges connecting the \n    j\n-th\nand the \n    (j + 1)\n-th vertices for each \n    1 \n    \u2264 j < c_i\n. Now you\ndecided to unite chains in one graph in the following way: the first chain is\nskipped; the \n    1\n-st vertex of the \n    i\n-th chain is connected by an edge\nwith the \n    a_i\n-th vertex of the \n    (i - 1)\n-th chain; the last\n(\n    c_i\n-th) vertex of the \n    i\n-th chain is connected by an edge with the\n\n    b_i\n-th vertex of the \n    (i - 1)\n-th chain. Picture of the first test\ncase. Dotted lines are the edges added during uniting process Calculate the\nlength of the longest simple cycle in the resulting graph. A simple cycle is a\nchain where the first and last vertices are connected as well. If you travel\nalong the simple cycle, each vertex of this cycle will be visited exactly\nonce. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case\ncontains the single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number\nof chains you have. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of vertices in the corresponding chains. The third line of each test\ncase contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    a_1 = -1\n;\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 c_i - 1\n). The fourth line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    b_1 = -1\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i\n    \n    \u2264 c_i - 1\n). Both \n    a_1\n and \n    b_1\n are equal to \n    -1\n, they\naren't used in graph building and given just for index consistency. It's\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed\n\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print the length of the longest simple\ncycle. Example Input 3 4 3 4 3 3 -1 1 2 2 -1 2 2 3 2 5 6 -1 5 -1 1 3 3 5 2 -1\n1 1 -1 3 5 Output 7 11 8 Note In the first test case, the longest simple cycle\nis shown below: We can't increase it with the first chain, since in such case\nit won't be simple \u2014 the vertex \n    2\n on the second chain will break\nsimplicity.\n\n",
