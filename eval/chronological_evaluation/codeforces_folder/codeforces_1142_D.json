        "description": "Traveling around the world you noticed that many shop owners raise prices to\ninadequate values if the see you are a foreigner. You define inadequate\nnumbers as follows: all integers from \n    1\n to \n    9\n are inadequate; for\nan integer \n    x \n    \u2265 10\n to be inadequate, it is required that the integer\n\n    \u230a x / 10 \n    \u230b\n is inadequate, but that's not the only\ncondition. Let's sort all the inadequate integers. Let \n    \u230a x / 10\n    \n    \u230b\n have number \n    k\n in this order. Then, the integer \n    x\n is\ninadequate only if the last digit of \n    x\n is strictly less than the\nreminder of division of \n    k\n by \n    11\n. Here \n    \u230a x / 10\n    \n    \u230b\n denotes \n    x/10\n rounded down. Thus, if \n    x\n is the\n\n    m\n-th in increasing order inadequate number, and \n    m\n gives the\nremainder \n    c\n when divided by \n    11\n, then integers \n    10 \n    \u00b7 x + 0,\n    10 \n    \u00b7 x + 1 \n    \u2026, 10 \n    \u00b7 x + (c - 1)\n are inadequate, while\nintegers \n    10 \n    \u00b7 x + c, 10 \n    \u00b7 x + (c + 1), \n    \u2026, 10 \n    \u00b7 x +\n    9\n are not inadequate. The first several inadequate integers are \n    1, 2, 3,\n    4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 21, 30, 31, 32 \n    \u2026\n. After that, since\n\n    4\n is the fourth inadequate integer, \n    40, 41, 42, 43\n are inadequate,\nwhile \n    44, 45, 46, \n    \u2026, 49\n are not inadequate; since \n    10\n is the\n\n    10\n-th inadequate number, integers \n    100, 101, 102, \n    \u2026, 109\n are\nall inadequate. And since \n    20\n is the \n    11\n-th inadequate number, none\nof \n    200, 201, 202, \n    \u2026, 209\n is inadequate. You wrote down all the\nprices you have seen in a trip. Unfortunately, all integers got concatenated\nin one large digit string \n    s\n and you lost the bounds between the\nneighboring integers. You are now interested in the number of substrings of\nthe resulting string that form an inadequate number. If a substring appears\nmore than once at different positions, all its appearances are counted\nseparately. Input The only line contains the string \n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 |s|\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n), consisting only of digits. It is guaranteed that the first\ndigit of \n    s\n is not zero. Output In the only line print the number of\nsubstrings of \n    s\n that form an inadequate number. Examples Input 4021\nOutput 6 Input 110 Output 3 Note In the first example the inadequate numbers\nin the string are \n    1, 2, 4, 21, 40, 402\n. In the second example the\ninadequate numbers in the string are \n    1\n and \n    10\n, and \n    1\n appears\ntwice (on the first and on the second positions).\n\n",
