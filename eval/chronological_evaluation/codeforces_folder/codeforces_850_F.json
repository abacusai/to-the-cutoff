        "description": "You have a bag of balls of n different colors. You have ai balls of the i-th\ncolor. While there are at least two different colored balls in the bag,\nperform the following steps: Take out two random balls without replacement one\nby one. These balls might be the same color. Color the second ball to the\ncolor of the first ball. You are not allowed to switch the order of the balls\nin this step. Place both balls back in the bag. All these actions take exactly\none second. Let M = 10^9 + 7. It can be proven that the expected amount of\ntime needed before you stop can be represented as a rational number , where P\nand Q are coprime integers and where Q is not divisible by M. Return the value\n. Input The first line of input will contain a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\n500) \u2014 the number of colors. The next line of input will contain n space\nseparated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of balls of\neach color. Output Print a single integer, the answer to the problem. Examples\nInput 2 1 1 Output 1 Input 3 1 2 3 Output 750000026 Note In the first sample,\nno matter what happens, the balls will become the same color after one step.\nFor the second sample, we have 6 balls. Let\u2019s label the balls from 1 to 6, and\nwithout loss of generality, let\u2019s say balls 1,2,3 are initially color 1, balls\n4,5 are color 2, and ball 6 are color 3. Here is an example of how these steps\ncan go: We choose ball 5 and ball 6. Ball 6 then becomes color 2. We choose\nball 4 and ball 5. Ball 5 remains the same color (color 2). We choose ball 1\nand ball 5. Ball 5 becomes color 1. We choose ball 6 and ball 5. Ball 5\nbecomes color 2. We choose ball 3 and ball 4. Ball 4 becomes color 1. We\nchoose ball 4 and ball 6. Ball 6 becomes color 1. We choose ball 2 and ball 5.\nBall 5 becomes color 1. At this point, the game ends since all the balls are\nthe same color. This particular sequence took 7 seconds.It can be shown that\nthe answer to this case is .\n\n",
