        "description": "You are given two binary strings \n    a\n and \n    b\n of length \n    n\n. In\neach move, the string \n    a\n is modified in the following way. An index\n\n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) is chosen uniformly at random. The\ncharacter \n    a_i\n will be flipped. That is, if \n    a_i\n is \n    0\n, it\nbecomes \n    1\n, and if \n    a_i\n is \n    1\n, it becomes \n    0\n. What is the\nexpected number of moves required to make both strings equal for the first\ntime? A binary string is a string, in which the character is either\n\n    0\n or \n    1\n. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the length\nof the strings. The second line of each test case contains the binary string\n\n    a\n of length \n    n\n. The third line of each test case contains the\nbinary string \n    b\n of length \n    n\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10^6\n. Output For each test\ncase, output a single line containing the expected number of moves modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Formally, let \n    M = 998\n     244\n     353\n. It can be\nshown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction\n\n    p/q\n, where \n    p\n and \n    q\n are integers and \n    q \n    \u2261 0 \n    M\n. Output the integer equal to \n    p \n    \u00b7 q^-1\n     M\n. In other words, output such an integer \n    x\n that \n    0 \n    \u2264 x\n    < M\n and \n    x \n    \u00b7 q \n    \u2261 p \n    M\n. Example Input 4 1 0 1 2 00\n00 4 1000 1110 5 01001 10111 Output 1 0 665496254 665496277 Note In the first\ntest case, index \n    1\n is chosen randomly and \n    a_1\n is flipped. After\nthe move, the strings \n    a\n and \n    b\n are equal. The expected number of\nmoves is \n    1\n. The strings \n    a\n and \n    b\n are already equal in the\nsecond test case. So, the expected number of moves is \n    0\n. The expected\nnumber of moves for the third and fourth test cases are \n    56/3\n\nand \n    125/3\n respectively.\n\n",
