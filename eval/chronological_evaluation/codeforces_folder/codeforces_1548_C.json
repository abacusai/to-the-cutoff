        "name": "The Three Little Pigs",
        "description": "Three little pigs from all over the world are meeting for a convention! Every\nminute, a triple of 3 new pigs arrives on the convention floor. After the\n\n    n\n-th minute, the convention ends. The big bad wolf has learned about\nthis convention, and he has an attack plan. At some minute in the convention,\nhe will arrive and eat exactly \n    x\n pigs. Then he will get away. The wolf\nwants Gregor to help him figure out the number of possible attack plans that\ninvolve eating exactly \n    x\n pigs for various values of \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    x \n    \u2264 3n\n). Two attack plans are considered different, if they occur at\ndifferent times or if the sets of little pigs to eat are different. Note that\nall queries are independent, that is, the wolf does not eat the little pigs,\nhe only makes plans! Input The first line of input contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n), the number of minutes the convention lasts and the number of queries\nthe wolf asks. Each of the next \n    q\n lines contains a single integer\n\n    x_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 3n\n), the number of pigs the wolf will eat\nin the \n    i\n-th query. Output You should print \n    q\n lines, with line\n\n    i\n representing the number of attack plans if the wolf wants to eat\n\n    x_i\n pigs. Since each query answer can be large, output each answer\nmodulo \n    10^9+7\n. Examples Input 2 3 1 5 6 Output 9 6 1 Input 5 4 2 4 6 8\nOutput 225 2001 6014 6939 Note In the example test, \n    n=2\n. Thus, there are\n\n    3\n pigs at minute \n    1\n, and \n    6\n pigs at minute \n    2\n. There are\nthree queries: \n    x=1\n, \n    x=5\n, and \n    x=6\n. If the wolf wants to eat\n\n    1\n pig, he can do so in \n    3+6=9\n possible attack plans, depending on\nwhether he arrives at minute \n    1\n or \n    2\n. If the wolf wants to eat\n\n    5\n pigs, the wolf cannot arrive at minute \n    1\n, since there aren't\nenough pigs at that time. Therefore, the wolf has to arrive at minute \n    2\n,\nand there are \n    6\n possible attack plans. If the wolf wants to eat \n    6\n\npigs, his only plan is to arrive at the end of the convention and devour\neverybody. Remember to output your answers modulo \n    10^9+7\n!\n\n",
