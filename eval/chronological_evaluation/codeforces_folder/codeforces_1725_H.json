        "description": "One day, you are accepted as being Dr. Chanek's assistant. The first task\ngiven by Dr. Chanek to you is to take care and store his magical stones. Dr.\nChanek has \n    N\n magical stones with \n    N\n being an even number. Those\nmagical stones are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    N\n. Magical stone \n    i\n has\na strength of \n    A_i\n. A magical stone can be painted with two colours,\nnamely the colour black or the colour white. You are tasked to paint the\nmagical stones with the colour black or white and store the magical stones\ninto a magic box with a magic coefficient \n    Z\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 Z \n    \u2264 2\n).\nThe painting of the magical stones must be done in a way such that there are\n\n    N/2\n black magical stones and \n    N/2\n white magical\nstones. Define \n    concat(x, y)\n for two integers \n    x\n and\n\n    y\n as the result of concatenating the digits of \n    x\n to the left of\n\n    y\n in their decimal representation without changing the order. As an\nexample, \n    concat(10, 24)\n will result in \n    1024\n. For a magic\nbox with a magic coefficient \n    Z\n, magical stone \n    i\n will react with\nmagical stone \n    j\n if the colours of both stones are different and\n\n    concat(A_i, A_j) \n    \u00d7\n    concat(A_j, A_i) + A_i \n    \u00d7\n    A_j \n    \u2261 Z \n     3\n. A magical stone that is reacting will be very hot\nand dangerous. Because of that, you must colour the magical stones and\ndetermine the magic coefficient \n    Z\n of the magic box in a way such that\nthere is no magical stone that reacts, or report if it is impossible. Input\nThe first line contains a single even integer \n    N\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of magical stones Dr. Chanek has. The second line\ncontains \n    N\n integer \n    A_1, A_2, \n    \u2026, A_N\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 A_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) \u2014 the strengths of all magical stones. Output If it is not possible\nto satisfy the condition of the problem, output \n    -1\n. Otherwise, output\ntwo lines. The first line contains an integer \n    Z\n denoting the magic\ncoefficient of the magic box. The second line contains a string \n    S\n of\nlength \n    N\n. \n    S_i\n is \n    0\n if magical stone \n    i\n is coloured\nblack or \n    1\n if magical stone \n    i\n is coloured white. If there are more\nthan one possibilities of colouring and choosing the magic coefficient\n\n    Z\n, output any of them. Example Input 4 4 10 9 14 Output 0 1001 Note By\ngiving the above colouring, it can be seen that: \n    i=1, j=2 \n    \u27f6\n    concat(4, 10) \n    \u00d7\n    concat(10, 4) + 10 \n    \u00d7 4 = 410\n    \n    \u00d7 104 + 40 = 42680 \n    \u2261 2 \n     3\n \n    i=1, j=3 \n    \u27f6\n    concat(4, 9) \n    \u00d7\n    concat(9, 4) + 4 \n    \u00d7 9 = 49\n    \n    \u00d7 94 + 36 = 4642 \n    \u2261 1 \n     3\n \n    i=4, j=2 \n    \u27f6\n    concat(14, 10) \n    \u00d7\n    concat(10, 14) + 10 \n    \u00d7 14 =\n    1410 \n    \u00d7 1014 + 140 = 1429880 \n    \u2261 2 \n     3\n \n    i=4, j=3\n    \n    \u27f6\n    concat(14, 9) \n    \u00d7\n    concat(9, 14) + 14\n    \n    \u00d7 9 = 149 \n    \u00d7 914 + 126 = 136312 \n    \u2261 1 \n     3\n Because of\nthat, by choosing \n    Z = 0\n, it can be guaranteed that there is no magical\nstone that reacts.\n\n",
