        "description": "Polycarp loves geometric progressions very much. Since he was only three years\nold, he loves only the progressions of length three. He also has a favorite\ninteger k and a sequence a, consisting of n integers. He wants to know how\nmany subsequences of length three can be selected from a, so that they form a\ngeometric progression with common ratio k. A subsequence of length three is a\ncombination of three such indexes i1, i2, i3, that 1 \u2264 i1 < i2 < i3 \u2264 n. That\nis, a subsequence of length three are such groups of three elements that are\nnot necessarily consecutive in the sequence, but their indexes are strictly\nincreasing. A geometric progression with common ratio k is a sequence of\nnumbers of the form b\u00b7k^0, b\u00b7k^1, ..., b\u00b7k^r-1. Polycarp is only three years\nold, so he can not calculate this number himself. Help him to do it. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains two integers, n and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 2\u00b710^5),\nshowing how many numbers Polycarp's sequence has and his favorite number. The\nsecond line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 10^9 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9) \u2014\nelements of the sequence. Output Output a single number \u2014 the number of ways\nto choose a subsequence of length three, such that it forms a geometric\nprogression with a common ratio k. Examples Input 5 2 1 1 2 2 4 Output 4 Input\n3 1 1 1 1 Output 1 Input 10 3 1 2 6 2 3 6 9 18 3 9 Output 6 Note In the first\nsample test the answer is four, as any of the two 1s can be chosen as the\nfirst element, the second element can be any of the 2s, and the third element\nof the subsequence must be equal to 4.\n\n",
