        "description": "A set of positive integers \n    S\n is called beautiful if, for every two\nintegers \n    x\n and \n    y\n from this set, either \n    x\n divides \n    y\n or\n\n    y\n divides \n    x\n (or both). You are given two integers \n    l\n and\n\n    r\n. Consider all beautiful sets consisting of integers not less than\n\n    l\n and not greater than \n    r\n. You have to print two numbers: the\nmaximum possible size of a beautiful set where all elements are from \n    l\n\nto \n    r\n; the number of beautiful sets consisting of integers from \n    l\n\nto \n    r\n with the maximum possible size. Since the second number can be very\nlarge, print it modulo \n    998244353\n. Input The first line contains one\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Each test case consists of one line containing two integers \n    l\n and\n\n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 10^6\n). Output For each test case, print\ntwo integers \u2014 the maximum possible size of a beautiful set consisting of\nintegers from \n    l\n to \n    r\n, and the number of such sets with maximum\npossible size. Since the second number can be very large, print it modulo\n\n    998244353\n. Example Input 4 3 11 13 37 1 22 4 100 Output 2 4 2 6 5 1 5 7\nNote In the first test case, the maximum possible size of a beautiful set with\nintegers from \n    3\n to \n    11\n is \n    2\n. There are \n    4\n such sets\nwhich have the maximum possible size: \n    3, 6\n; \n    3, 9\n; \n    4, 8\n; \n    5, 10\n.\n\n",
