        "description": "Monocarp has got an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n integers. Let's denote\n\n    k\n as the mathematic mean of these elements (note that it's possible that\n\n    k\n is not an integer). The mathematic mean of an array of \n    n\n\nelements is the sum of elements divided by the number of these elements (i. e.\nsum divided by \n    n\n). Monocarp wants to delete exactly two elements from\n\n    a\n so that the mathematic mean of the remaining \n    (n - 2)\n elements is\nstill equal to \n    k\n. Your task is to calculate the number of pairs of\npositions \n    [i, j]\n (\n    i < j\n) such that if the elements on these\npositions are deleted, the mathematic mean of \n    (n - 2)\n remaining elements\nis equal to \n    k\n (that is, it is equal to the mathematic mean of \n    n\n\nelements of the original array \n    a\n). Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of elements in the array. The second\nline contains a sequence of integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264\n    a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), where \n    a_i\n is the \n    i\n-th element of the array.\nThe sum of \n    n\n over all testcases doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n.\nOutput Print one integer \u2014 the number of pairs of positions \n    [i, j]\n (\n    i\n    < j\n) such that if the elements on these positions are deleted, the\nmathematic mean of \n    (n - 2)\n remaining elements is equal to \n    k\n (that\nis, it is equal to the mathematic mean of \n    n\n elements of the original\narray \n    a\n). Example Input 4 4 8 8 8 8 3 50 20 10 5 1 4 7 3 5 7 1 2 3 4 5 6\n7 Output 6 0 2 3 Note In the first example, any pair of elements can be\nremoved since all of them are equal. In the second example, there is no way to\ndelete two elements so the mathematic mean doesn't change. In the third\nexample, it is possible to delete the elements on positions \n    1\n and\n\n    3\n, or the elements on positions \n    4\n and \n    5\n.\n\n",
