        "name": "Intense Heat",
        "description": "The heat during the last few days has been really intense. Scientists from all\nover the Berland study how the temperatures and weather change, and they claim\nthat this summer is abnormally hot. But any scientific claim sounds a lot more\nreasonable if there are some numbers involved, so they have decided to\nactually calculate some value which would represent how high the temperatures\nare. Mathematicians of Berland State University came up with a special heat\nintensity value. This value is calculated as follows: Suppose we want to\nanalyze the segment of \n    n\n consecutive days. We have measured the\ntemperatures during these \n    n\n days; the temperature during \n    i\n-th day\nequals \n    a_i\n. We denote the average temperature of a segment of some\nconsecutive days as the arithmetic mean of the temperature measures during\nthis segment of days. So, if we want to analyze the average temperature from\nday \n    x\n to day \n    y\n, we calculate it as \n    \u2211\n    _i\n    = x^y a_i/y - x + 1\n (note that division is performed without any\nrounding). The heat intensity value is the maximum of average temperatures\nover all segments of not less than \n    k\n consecutive days. For example, if\nanalyzing the measures \n    [3, 4, 1, 2]\n and \n    k = 3\n, we are interested\nin segments \n    [3, 4, 1]\n, \n    [4, 1, 2]\n and \n    [3, 4, 1, 2]\n (we want\nto find the maximum value of average temperature over these segments). You\nhave been hired by Berland State University to write a program that would\ncompute the heat intensity value of a given period of days. Are you up to this\ntask? Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the number of days in the given period, and\nthe minimum number of days in a segment we consider when calculating heat\nintensity value, respectively. The second line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n, ..., \n    a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the\ntemperature measures during given \n    n\n days. Output Print one real number \u2014\nthe heat intensity value, i. e., the maximum of average temperatures over all\nsegments of not less than \n    k\n consecutive days. Your answer will be\nconsidered correct if the following condition holds: \n    |res - res_0| <\n    10^-6\n, where \n    res\n is your answer, and \n    res_0\n is the answer\ngiven by the jury's solution. Example Input 4 3 3 4 1 2 Output\n2.666666666666667\n\n",
