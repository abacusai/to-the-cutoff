        "description": "Santa has \n    n\n candies and he wants to gift them to \n    k\n kids. He wants\nto divide as many candies as possible between all \n    k\n kids. Santa can't\ndivide one candy into parts but he is allowed to not use some candies at all.\nSuppose the kid who recieves the minimum number of candies has \n    a\n candies\nand the kid who recieves the maximum number of candies has \n    b\n candies.\nThen Santa will be satisfied, if the both conditions are met at the same time:\n\n    b - a \n    \u2264 1\n (it means \n    b = a\n or \n    b = a + 1\n); the number of\nkids who has \n    a+1\n candies (note that \n    a+1\n not necessarily equals\n\n    b\n) does not exceed \n    \u230a\n    k/2\n    \u230b\n (less than or\nequal to \n    \u230a\n    k/2\n    \u230b\n).\n\n    \u230a\n    k/2\n    \u230b\n is \n    k\n divided by \n    2\n and\nrounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if \n    k=5\n then\n\n    \u230a\n    k/2\n    \u230b=\n    \u230a\n    5/2\n    \u230b=2\n. Your\ntask is to find the maximum number of candies Santa can give to kids so that\nhe will be satisfied. You have to answer \n    t\n independent test cases. Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 5\n    \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next \n    t\n lines describe\ntest cases. The \n    i\n-th test case contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, k \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of candies and the number of\nkids. Output For each test case print the answer on it \u2014 the maximum number of\ncandies Santa can give to kids so that he will be satisfied. Example Input 5 5\n2 19 4 12 7 6 2 100000 50010 Output 5 18 10 6 75015 Note In the first test\ncase, Santa can give \n    3\n and \n    2\n candies to kids. There \n    a=2,\n    b=3,a+1=3\n. In the second test case, Santa can give \n    5, 5, 4\n and\n\n    4\n candies. There \n    a=4,b=5,a+1=5\n. The answer cannot be greater\nbecause then the number of kids with \n    5\n candies will be \n    3\n. In the\nthird test case, Santa can distribute candies in the following way: \n    [1, 2,\n    2, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n. There \n    a=1,b=2,a+1=2\n. He cannot distribute two\nremaining candies in a way to be satisfied. In the fourth test case, Santa can\ndistribute candies in the following way: \n    [3, 3]\n. There \n    a=3, b=3,\n    a+1=4\n. Santa distributed all \n    6\n candies.\n\n",
