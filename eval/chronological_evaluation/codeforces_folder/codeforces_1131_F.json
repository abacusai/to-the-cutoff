        "description": "Asya loves animals very much. Recently, she purchased \n    n\n kittens,\nenumerated them from \n    1\n and \n    n\n and then put them into the cage. The\ncage consists of one row of \n    n\n cells, enumerated with integers from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n from left to right. Adjacent cells had a partially\ntransparent partition wall between them, hence there were \n    n - 1\n\npartitions originally. Initially, each cell contained exactly one kitten with\nsome number. Observing the kittens, Asya noticed, that they are very friendly\nand often a pair of kittens in neighboring cells wants to play together. So\nAsya started to remove partitions between neighboring cells. In particular, on\nthe day \n    i\n, Asya: Noticed, that the kittens \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n,\nlocated in neighboring cells want to play together. Removed the partition\nbetween these two cells, efficiently creating a single cell, having all\nkittens from two original cells. Since Asya has never putted partitions back,\nafter \n    n - 1\n days the cage contained a single cell, having all kittens.\nFor every day, Asya remembers numbers of kittens \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n, who\nwanted to play together, however she doesn't remember how she placed kittens\nin the cage in the beginning. Please help her and find any possible initial\narrangement of the kittens into \n    n\n cells. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 150\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of\nkittens. Each of the following \n    n - 1\n lines contains integers \n    x_i\n\nand \n    y_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i, y_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    x_i \n     y_i\n) \u2014 indices\nof kittens, which got together due to the border removal on the corresponding\nday. It's guaranteed, that the kittens \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n were in the\ndifferent cells before this day. Output For every cell from \n    1\n to \n    n\n\nprint a single integer \u2014 the index of the kitten from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, who\nwas originally in it. All printed integers must be distinct. It's guaranteed,\nthat there is at least one answer possible. In case there are multiple\npossible answers, print any of them. Example Input 5 1 4 2 5 3 1 4 5 Output 3\n1 4 2 5 Note The answer for the example contains one of several possible\ninitial arrangements of the kittens. The picture below shows how the cells\nwere united for this initial arrangement. Note, that the kittens who wanted to\nplay together on each day were indeed in adjacent cells.\n\n",
