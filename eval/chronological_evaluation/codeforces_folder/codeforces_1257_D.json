        "name": "Yet Another Monster Killing Problem",
        "description": "You play a computer game. In this game, you lead a party of \n    m\n heroes,\nand you have to clear a dungeon with \n    n\n monsters. Each monster is\ncharacterized by its power \n    a_i\n. Each hero is characterized by his power\n\n    p_i\n and endurance \n    s_i\n. The heroes clear the dungeon day by day. In\nthe beginning of each day, you choose a hero (exactly one) who is going to\nenter the dungeon this day. When the hero enters the dungeon, he is challenged\nby the first monster which was not defeated during the previous days (so, if\nthe heroes have already defeated \n    k\n monsters, the hero fights with the\nmonster \n    k + 1\n). When the hero fights the monster, there are two possible\noutcomes: if the monster's power is strictly greater than the hero's power,\nthe hero retreats from the dungeon. The current day ends; otherwise, the\nmonster is defeated. After defeating a monster, the hero either continues\nfighting with the next monster or leaves the dungeon. He leaves the dungeon\neither if he has already defeated the number of monsters equal to his\nendurance during this day (so, the \n    i\n-th hero cannot defeat more than\n\n    s_i\n monsters during each day), or if all monsters are defeated \u2014\notherwise, he fights with the next monster. When the hero leaves the dungeon,\nthe current day ends. Your goal is to defeat the last monster. What is the\nminimum number of days that you need to achieve your goal? Each day you have\nto use exactly one hero; it is possible that some heroes don't fight the\nmonsters at all. Each hero can be used arbitrary number of times. Input The\nfirst line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. Then the test cases follow. The first line of each test\ncase contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of monsters in the dungeon. The second line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n, ..., \n    a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), where\n\n    a_i\n is the power of the \n    i\n-th monster. The third line contains one\ninteger \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of heroes\nin your party. Then \n    m\n lines follow, each describing a hero. Each line\ncontains two integers \n    p_i\n and \n    s_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n,\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 s_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the power and the endurance of the \n    i\n-th\nhero. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n + m\n over all test cases does\nnot exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case print one integer \u2014\nthe minimum number of days you have to spend to defeat all of the monsters (or\n\n    -1\n if it is impossible). Example Input 2 6 2 3 11 14 1 8 2 3 2 100 1 5 3\n5 100 2 3 2 30 5 90 1 Output 5 -1\n\n",
