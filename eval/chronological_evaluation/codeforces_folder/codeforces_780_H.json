        "description": "A new bus route is opened in the city . The route is a closed polygon line in\nthe place, with all segments parallel to one of the axes. m buses will operate\non the route. All buses move in a loop along the route in the same direction\nwith equal constant velocities (stopping times are negligible in this\nproblem). Buses start their movement in the first vertex of the route with\nequal interval. Suppose that T is the total time for a single bus to travel\nthe whole loop of the route. Then, the bus 1 starts moving at time 0, the bus\n2 starts at time T / m, the bus 3 starts at time 2T / m, and so on; finally,\nthe bus m starts moving at time (m - 1)T / m. Thus, all intervals between\npairs of consecutive buses (including the interval between the last and the\nfirst bus) are equal. Buses can communicate with each other via wireless\ntransmitters of equal power. If the transmitters have power D, then only buses\nwithin distance D of each other can communicate. The buses are also equipped\nwith a distributed system of schedule tracking. For all buses to stick to the\nschedule, the system has to synchronize the necessary data between all buses\nfrom time to time. At the moment of synchronization, the bus 1 communicates\nwith the bus 2, the bus 2 \u2014 with bus 3, and so on; also, the bus m\ncommunicates with the bus 1. As a research employee, you are tasked with\nfinding the smallest value of D such that it is possible to find a time moment\nto perform synchronization once all buses have started moving. Input The first\nline contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of vertices\nof the polygonal line, and the number of buses respectively. Next n lines\ndescribe the vertices of the route in the traversing order. Each of these\nlines contains two integers xi, yi ( - 1000 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 1000) \u2014 coordinates of\nrespective vertex. It is guaranteed that each leg of the route (including the\nleg between the last and the first vertex) is paralles to one of the\ncoordinate axes. Moreover, no two subsequent vertices of the route coincide.\nThe route is allowed to have self-intersections, and travel along the same\nsegment multiple times. Output Print one real number \u2014 the answer to the\nproblem. Your answer will be accepted if the relative or the absolute error\ndoesn't exceed 10^-6. Examples Input 4 2 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 Output 1.000000000\nInput 2 2 0 0 1 0 Output 0.000000000 Note Suppose that each bus travel 1\ndistance unit per second. In the first sample case, in 0.5 seconds buses will\nbe at distance 1, hence we can choose D = 1. In the second sample case, in 0.5\nseconds both buses will be at (0.5, 0), hence we can choose D = 0.\n\n",
