        "name": "Don't fear, DravDe is kind",
        "description": "A motorcade of n trucks, driving from city \u00abZ\u00bb to city \u00ab\u0417\u00bb, has approached a\ntunnel, known as Tunnel of Horror. Among truck drivers there were rumours\nabout monster DravDe, who hunts for drivers in that tunnel. Some drivers fear\nto go first, others - to be the last, but let's consider the general case.\nEach truck is described with four numbers: v \u2014 value of the truck, of its\npassangers and cargo c \u2014 amount of passanger on the truck, the driver included\nl \u2014 total amount of people that should go into the tunnel before this truck,\nso that the driver can overcome his fear (\u00abif the monster appears in front of\nthe motorcade, he'll eat them first\u00bb) r \u2014 total amount of people that should\nfollow this truck, so that the driver can overcome his fear (\u00abif the monster\nappears behind the motorcade, he'll eat them first\u00bb). Since the road is\nnarrow, it's impossible to escape DravDe, if he appears from one side.\nMoreover, the motorcade can't be rearranged. The order of the trucks can't be\nchanged, but it's possible to take any truck out of the motorcade, and leave\nit near the tunnel for an indefinite period. You, as the head of the\nmotorcade, should remove some of the trucks so, that the rest of the motorcade\ncan move into the tunnel and the total amount of the left trucks' values is\nmaximal. Input The first input line contains integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014\namount of trucks in the motorcade. The following n lines contain four integers\neach. Numbers in the i-th line: vi, ci, li, ri (1 \u2264 vi \u2264 10^4, 1 \u2264 ci \u2264 10^5,\n0 \u2264 li, ri \u2264 10^5) \u2014 describe the i-th truck. The trucks are numbered from 1,\ncounting from the front of the motorcade. Output In the first line output\nnumber k \u2014 amount of trucks that will drive into the tunnel. In the second\nline output k numbers \u2014 indexes of these trucks in ascending order. Don't\nforget please that you are not allowed to change the order of trucks. If the\nanswer is not unique, output any. Examples Input 5 1 1 0 3 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1\n3 0 2 1 3 0 Output 4 1 2 3 5 Input 5 1 1 0 3 10 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 10 1 1 2 3 1 3 0\nOutput 3 1 3 5\n\n",
