        "description": "Lottery \"Three Sevens\" was held for \n    m\n days. On day \n    i\n, \n    n_i\n\npeople with the numbers \n    a_i, 1, \n    \u2026, a_i, n_i\n participated in\nthe lottery. It is known that in each of the \n    m\n days, only one winner was\nselected from the lottery participants. The lottery winner on day \n    i\n was\nnot allowed to participate in the lottery in the days from \n    i+1\n to\n\n    m\n. Unfortunately, the information about the lottery winners has been\nlost. You need to find any possible list of lottery winners on days from\n\n    1\n to \n    m\n or determine that no solution exists. Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 50\n     000\n). The description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    m\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 50\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of days in which the lottery\nwas held. Next, for each \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    m\n, follows a two-line\nblock of data. The first line of each block contains a single integer\n\n    n_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n_i \n    \u2264 50\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of lottery\nparticipants on day \n    i\n. The second line of the block contains integers\n\n    a_i, 1, \n    \u2026, a_i, n_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, j\n    \u2264 50\n     000\n)\n\u2014 lottery participants on day \n    i\n. It is guaranteed that all the numbers\n\n    a_i, 1, \n    \u2026, a_i, n_i\n are pairwise distinct. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n_i\n over all blocks of all test cases does not exceed\n\n    50\n     000\n. Output For each test case, if there is no solution, print a\nsingle integer \n    -1\n. Otherwise, print \n    m\n integers \n    p_1, p_2,\n    \n    \u2026, p_m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 50\n     000\n) \u2014 lottery winners on days\nfrom \n    1\n to \n    m\n. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\nExample Input 3 3 4 1 2 4 8 3 2 9 1 2 1 4 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 4 4 1 2 3 4 1 1 1 4 1\n3 Output 8 2 1 -1 2 1 4 3 Note In the first test case, one of the answers is\n\n    [8, 2, 1]\n since the participant with the number \n    8\n participated on\nday \n    1\n, but did not participate on days \n    2\n and \n    3\n; the\nparticipant with the number \n    2\n participated on day \n    2\n, but did not\nparticipate on day \n    3\n; and the participant with the number \n    1\n\nparticipated on day \n    3\n. Note that this is not the only possible answer,\nfor example, \n    [8, 9, 4]\n is also a correct answer. In the second test\ncase, both lottery participants participated on both days, so any possible\nlottery winner on the day \n    1\n must have participated on the day \n    2\n,\nwhich is not allowed. Thus, there is no correct answer. In the third test\ncase, only one participant participated on days \n    2\n, \n    3\n, \n    4\n, and\non day \n    1\n there is only one participant who did not participate in the\nlottery on days \n    2, 3, 4\n \u2014 participant \n    2\n, which means \n    [2, 1, 4,\n    3]\n is the only correct answer to this test case.\n\n",
