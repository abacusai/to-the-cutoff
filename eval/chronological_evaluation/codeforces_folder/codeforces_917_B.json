        "description": "As we all know, Max is the best video game player among her friends. Her\nfriends were so jealous of hers, that they created an actual game just to\nprove that she's not the best at games. The game is played on a directed\nacyclic graph (a DAG) with n vertices and m edges. There's a character written\non each edge, a lowercase English letter. Max and Lucas are playing the game.\nMax goes first, then Lucas, then Max again and so on. Each player has a\nmarble, initially located at some vertex. Each player in his/her turn should\nmove his/her marble along some edge (a player can move the marble from vertex\nv to vertex u if there's an outgoing edge from v to u). If the player moves\nhis/her marble from vertex v to vertex u, the \"character\" of that round is the\ncharacter written on the edge from v to u. There's one additional rule; the\nASCII code of character of round i should be greater than or equal to the\nASCII code of character of round i - 1 (for i > 1). The rounds are numbered\nfor both players together, i. e. Max goes in odd numbers, Lucas goes in even\nnumbers. The player that can't make a move loses the game. The marbles may be\nat the same vertex at the same time. Since the game could take a while and\nLucas and Max have to focus on finding Dart, they don't have time to play. So\nthey asked you, if they both play optimally, who wins the game? You have to\ndetermine the winner of the game for all initial positions of the marbles.\nInput The first line of input contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, ).\nThe next m lines contain the edges. Each line contains two integers v, u and a\nlowercase English letter c, meaning there's an edge from v to u written c on\nit (1 \u2264 v, u \u2264 n, v \u2260 u). There's at most one edge between any pair of\nvertices. It is guaranteed that the graph is acyclic. Output Print n lines, a\nstring of length n in each one. The j-th character in i-th line should be 'A'\nif Max will win the game in case her marble is initially at vertex i and\nLucas's marble is initially at vertex j, and 'B' otherwise.
