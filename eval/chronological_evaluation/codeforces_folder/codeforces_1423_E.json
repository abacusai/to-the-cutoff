        "name": "5G Antenna Towers",
        "description": "After making a strategic plan with carriers for expansion of mobile network\nthroughout the whole country, the government decided to cover rural areas with\nthe last generation of 5G network. Since 5G antenna towers will be built in\nthe area of mainly private properties, the government needs an easy way to\nfind information about landowners for each property partially or fully\ncontained in the planned building area. The planned building area is\nrepresented as a rectangle with sides \n    width\n and \n    height\n. Every 5G\nantenna tower occupies a circle with a center in \n    (x,y)\n and radius\n\n    r\n. There is a database of Geodetic Institute containing information\nabout each property. Each property is defined with its identification number\nand polygon represented as an array of \n    (x,y)\n points in the counter-\nclockwise direction. Your task is to build an IT system which can handle\nqueries of type \n    (x, y, r)\n in which \n    (x,y)\n represents a circle\ncenter, while \n    r\n represents its radius. The IT system should return the\ntotal area of properties that need to be acquired for the building of a tower\nso that the government can estimate the price. Furthermore, the system should\nreturn a list of identification numbers of these properties (so that the\nowners can be contacted for land acquisition). A property needs to be acquired\nif the circle of the antenna tower is intersecting or touching it. Input The\nfirst line contains the size of the building area as double values\n\n    width\n, \n    height\n, and an integer \n    n\n \u2014 the number of properties\nin the database. Each of the next \n    n\n lines contains the description of a\nsingle property in the form of an integer number \n    v\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 v \n    \u2264\n    40\n) \u2014 the number of points that define a property, as well as \n    2*v\n\ndouble numbers \u2014 the coordinates \n    (x,y)\n of each property point. Line\n\n    i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n-1\n) contains the information for property with\nid \n    i\n. The next line contains an integer \n    q\n \u2014 the number of queries.\nEach of the next \n    q\n lines contains double values \n    x\n, \n    y\n,\n\n    r\n \u2014 the coordinates of an antenna circle center \n    (x, y)\n and its\nradius \n    r\n. \n    1 \n    \u2264 n * q \n    \u2264 10^6\n Output For each of the \n    q\n\nqueries, your program should output a line containing the total area of all\nthe properties that need to be acquired, an integer representing the number of\nsuch properties, as well as the list of ids of these properties (separated by\nblank characters, arbitrary order). Example Input 10 10 3 4 2 2 3 2 3 3 2 3 3\n3.5 2 4.5 2 4.5 3 4 7 8 7.5 8.5 8 8 7.5 9 5 2 3.5 0.5 3.3 2 0.4 5 2.5 0.5 7.5\n8.5 0.5 3 7 0.5 Output 1.000000 1 0 1.500000 2 0 1 0.500000 1 1 0.250000 1 2\n0.000000 0 Note You can assume that the land not covered with properties\n(polygons) is under the government's ownership and therefore doesn't need to\nbe acquired. Properties do not intersect with each other. Precision being used\nfor solution checking is \n    10^-4\n.\n\n",
