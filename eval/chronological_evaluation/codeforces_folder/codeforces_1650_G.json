        "description": "Given an undirected connected graph with \n    n\n vertices and \n    m\n edges.\nThe graph contains no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and multiple edges\n(i.e. no more than one edge between each pair of vertices). The vertices of\nthe graph are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Find the number of paths from\na vertex \n    s\n to \n    t\n whose length differs from the shortest path from\n\n    s\n to \n    t\n by no more than \n    1\n. It is necessary to consider all\nsuitable paths, even if they pass through the same vertex or edge more than\nonce (i.e. they are not simple). Graph consisting of \n    6\n of vertices and\n\n    8\n of edges For example, let \n    n = 6\n, \n    m = 8\n, \n    s = 6\n and\n\n    t = 1\n, and let the graph look like the figure above. Then the length of\nthe shortest path from \n    s\n to \n    t\n is \n    1\n. Consider all paths whose\nlength is at most \n    1 + 1 = 2\n. \n    6 \n    \u2192 1\n. The length of the\npath is \n    1\n. \n    6 \n    \u2192 4 \n    \u2192 1\n. Path length is\n\n    2\n. \n    6 \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 1\n. Path length is \n    2\n. \n    6\n    \n    \u2192 5 \n    \u2192 1\n. Path length is \n    2\n. There is a total\nof \n    4\n of matching paths. Input The first line of test contains the number\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014the number of test cases in the test.\nBefore each test case, there is a blank line. The first line of test case\ncontains two numbers \n    n, m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014the number of vertices and edges in the\ngraph. The second line contains two numbers \n    s\n and \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 s,\n    t \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    s \n    \u2260 t\n) \u2014the numbers of the start and end vertices of\nthe path. The following \n    m\n lines contain descriptions of edges: the\n\n    i\nth line contains two integers \n    u_i\n, \n    v_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i,v_i\n    \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the numbers of vertices that connect the \n    i\nth edge. It is\nguaranteed that the graph is connected and does not contain loops and multiple\nedges. It is guaranteed that the sum of values \n    n\n on all test cases of\ninput data does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Similarly, it is guaranteed\nthat the sum of values \n    m\n on all test cases of input data does not exceed\n\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, output a single number \u2014 the\nnumber of paths from \n    s\n to \n    t\n such that their length differs from\nthe length of the shortest path by no more than \n    1\n. Since this number may\nbe too large, output it modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n.
