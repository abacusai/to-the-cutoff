        "description": "Do you know the story about the three musketeers? Anyway, you must help them\nnow. Richelimakieu is a cardinal in the city of Bearis. He found three brave\nwarriors and called them the three musketeers. Athos has strength a, Borthos\nstrength b, and Caramis has strength c. The year 2015 is almost over and there\nare still n criminals to be defeated. The i-th criminal has strength ti. It's\nhard to defeat strong criminals \u2014 maybe musketeers will have to fight together\nto achieve it. Richelimakieu will coordinate musketeers' actions. In each hour\neach musketeer can either do nothing or be assigned to one criminal. Two or\nthree musketeers can be assigned to the same criminal and then their strengths\nare summed up. A criminal can be defeated in exactly one hour (also if two or\nthree musketeers fight him). Richelimakieu can't allow the situation where a\ncriminal has strength bigger than the sum of strengths of musketeers fighting\nhim \u2014 a criminal would win then! In other words, there are three ways to\ndefeat a criminal. A musketeer of the strength x in one hour can defeat a\ncriminal of the strength not greater than x. So, for example Athos in one hour\ncan defeat criminal i only if ti \u2264 a. Two musketeers can fight together and in\none hour defeat a criminal of the strength not greater than the sum of\nstrengths of these two musketeers. So, for example Athos and Caramis in one\nhour can defeat criminal i only if ti \u2264 a + c. Note that the third remaining\nmusketeer can either do nothing or fight some other criminal. Similarly, all\nthree musketeers can fight together and in one hour defeat a criminal of the\nstrength not greater than the sum of musketeers' strengths, i.e. ti \u2264 a + b +\nc. Richelimakieu doesn't want musketeers to fight during the New Year's Eve.\nThus, he must coordinate their actions in order to minimize the number of\nhours till all criminals will be defeated. Find the minimum number of hours to\ndefeat all criminals. If musketeers can't defeat them all then print \"-1\"\n(without the quotes) instead. Input The first line of the input contains a\nsingle integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number of criminals. The second line\ncontains three integers a, b and c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^8) \u2014 strengths of\nmusketeers. The third line contains n integers t1, t2, ..., tn (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 10^8)\n\u2014 strengths of criminals. Output Print one line with the answer. If it's\nimpossible to defeat all criminals, print \"-1\" (without the quotes).\nOtherwise, print the minimum number of hours the three musketeers will spend\non defeating all criminals. Examples Input 5 10 20 30 1 1 1 1 50 Output 2\nInput 5 10 20 30 1 1 1 1 51 Output 3 Input 7 30 20 10 34 19 50 33 88 15 20\nOutput -1 Input 6 10 5 10 10 9 5 25 20 5 Output 3 Note In the first sample\nAthos has strength 10, Borthos 20, and Caramis 30. They can defeat all\ncriminals in two hours: Borthos and Caramis should together fight a criminal\nwith strength 50. In the same hour Athos can fight one of four criminals with\nstrength 1. There are three criminals left, each with strength 1. Each\nmusketeer can fight one criminal in the second hour. In the second sample all\nthree musketeers must together fight a criminal with strength 51. It takes one\nhour. In the second hour they can fight separately, each with one criminal. In\nthe third hour one criminal is left and any of musketeers can fight him.\n\n",
