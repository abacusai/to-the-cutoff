        "name": "Ela Takes Dancing Class",
        "description": "DTL engineers love partying in the weekend. Ela does, too! Unfortunately, she\ndidn't know how to dance yet. Therefore, she decided to take a dancing class.\nThere are \n    n\n students in the dancing class, including Ela. In the final\nproject, \n    n\n students will participate in a choreography described below.\n\n    n\n students are positioned on the positive side of the \n    Ox\n-axis. The\n\n    i\n-th dancer is located at \n    a_i > 0\n. Some dancers will change\npositions during the dance (we'll call them movable dancers), and others will\nstay in the same place during a choreography (we'll call them immovable\ndancers). We distinguish the dancers using a binary string \n    s\n of length\n\n    n\n: if \n    s_i\n equals '1', then the \n    i\n-th dancer is movable,\notherwise the \n    i\n-th dancer is immovable. Let's call the \"positive energy\nvalue\" of the choreography \n    d > 0\n. The dancers will perform \"movements\"\nbased on this value. Each minute after the dance begins, the movable dancer\nwith the smallest \n    x\n-coordinate will start moving to the right and\ninitiate a \"movement\". At the beginning of the movement, the dancer's energy\nlevel will be initiated equally to the positive energy value of the\nchoreography, which is \n    d\n. Each time they move from some \n    y\n to\n\n    y+1\n, the energy level will be decreased by \n    1\n. At some point, the\ndancer might meet other fellow dancers in the same coordinates. If it happens,\nthen the energy level of the dancer will be increased by \n    1\n. A dancer\nwill stop moving to the right when his energy level reaches \n    0\n, and he\ndoesn't share a position with another dancer. The dancers are very well-\ntrained, and each \"movement\" will end before the next minute begins. To show\nher understanding of this choreography, Ela has to answer \n    q\n queries,\neach consisting of two integers \n    k\n and \n    m\n. The answer to this query\nis the coordinate of the \n    m\n-th dancer of both types from the left at\n\n    k\n-th minute after the choreography begins. In other words, denote\n\n    x_k, 1, x_k, 2, \n    \u2026, x_k, n\n as the sorted coordinates of the\ndancers at \n    k\n-th minute from the beginning, you need to print \n    x_k,\n    m\n. Input The first line contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    d\n and\n\n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 d \n    \u2264 10^9\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 q\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of dancers, the positive energy value of the\nchoreography, and the number of queries. The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_1 < a_2 < \n    \u2026 < a_n\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the coordinates of each dancer. The third line contains a\nbinary string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n \u2014 the movability of each dancer. Each\ncharacter is either '0' or '1'. It is guaranteed that \n    s\n contains at\nleast one character '1'. Then \n    q\n lines follow, the \n    i\n-th of them\ncontains two integers \n    k_i\n and \n    m_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n,\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 m_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the content of each query. Output Output \n    q\n\nlines, each contains a single integer \u2014 the answer for the corresponding\nquery. Examples Input 4 3 8 1 3 6 7 1011 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 1 2 2 2 3 2 4\nOutput 3 5 6 7 3 6 7 10 Input 1 1 5 2 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 Output 3 4 5 6 7\nNote Let's consider the first example test case. In the first minute, \n    1\n\nis the lowest coordinate between movable dancers. The energy level is\ninitiated with \n    3\n. Then the following happens: The dancer moves from\n\n    1\n to \n    2\n. The energy level decreased to \n    2\n. The dancer moves\nfrom \n    2\n to \n    3\n. The energy level decreased to \n    1\n, then increased\nto \n    2\n when she met another dancer at \n    3\n. The dancer moves from\n\n    3\n to \n    4\n. The energy level decreased to \n    1\n. The dancer moves\nfrom \n    4\n to \n    5\n. The energy level decreased to \n    0\n. At the end of\nthe first minute, the sorted coordinates of the dancers become \n    [3, 5, 6,\n    7]\n, and their respective movability is '0111'. In the second minute,\n\n    5\n is the lowest coordinate between movable dancers. The energy level is\ninitiated with \n    3\n. Then the following happens: The dancer moves from\n\n    5\n to \n    6\n. The energy level decreased to \n    2\n, then increased to\n\n    3\n when she met another dancer at \n    6\n. The dancer moves from \n    6\n\nto \n    7\n. The energy level decreased to \n    2\n, then increased to \n    3\n\nwhen she met another dancer at \n    7\n. The dancer moves from \n    7\n to\n\n    8\n. The energy level decreased to \n    2\n. The dancer moves from \n    8\n\nto \n    9\n. The energy level decreased to \n    1\n. The dancer moves from\n\n    9\n to \n    10\n. The energy level decreased to \n    0\n. At the end of the\nsecond minute, the sorted coordinates of the dancers become \n    [3, 6, 7,\n    10]\n, and their respective movability is '0111'.\n\n",
