        "description": "In Pavlopolis University where Noora studies it was decided to hold beauty\ncontest \"Miss Pavlopolis University\". Let's describe the process of choosing\nthe most beautiful girl in the university in more detail. The contest is held\nin several stages. Suppose that exactly n girls participate in the competition\ninitially. All the participants are divided into equal groups, x participants\nin each group. Furthermore the number x is chosen arbitrarily, i. e. on every\nstage number x can be different. Within each group the jury of the contest\ncompares beauty of the girls in the format \"each with each\". In this way, if\ngroup consists of x girls, then comparisons occur. Then, from each group, the\nmost beautiful participant is selected. Selected girls enter the next stage of\nthe competition. Thus if n girls were divided into groups, x participants in\neach group, then exactly participants will enter the next stage. The contest\ncontinues until there is exactly one girl left who will be \"Miss Pavlopolis\nUniversity\" But for the jury this contest is a very tedious task. They would\nlike to divide the girls into groups in each stage so that the total number of\npairwise comparisons of the girls is as few as possible. Let f(n) be the\nminimal total number of comparisons that should be made to select the most\nbeautiful participant, if we admit n girls to the first stage. The organizers\nof the competition are insane. They give Noora three integers t, l and r and\nask the poor girl to calculate the value of the following expression: t^0\u00b7f(l)\n+ t^1\u00b7f(l + 1) + ... + t^r-l\u00b7f(r). However, since the value of this expression\ncan be quite large the organizers ask her to calculate it modulo 10^9 + 7. If\nNoora can calculate the value of this expression the organizers promise her to\nhelp during the beauty contest. But the poor girl is not strong in\nmathematics, so she turned for help to Leha and he turned to you. Input The\nfirst and single line contains three integers t, l and r (1 \u2264 t < 10^9 + 7, 2\n\u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 5\u00b710^6). Output In the first line print single integer \u2014 the value\nof the expression modulo 10^9 + 7. Example Input 2 2 4 Output 19 Note Consider\nthe sample. It is necessary to find the value of . f(2) = 1. From two girls\nyou can form only one group of two people, in which there will be one\ncomparison. f(3) = 3. From three girls you can form only one group of three\npeople, in which there will be three comparisons. f(4) = 3. From four girls\nyou can form two groups of two girls each. Then at the first stage there will\nbe two comparisons, one in each of the two groups. In the second stage there\nwill be two girls and there will be one comparison between them. Total 2 + 1 =\n3 comparisons. You can also leave all girls in same group in the first stage.\nThen comparisons will occur. Obviously, it's better to split girls into groups\nin the first way. Then the value of the expression is .\n\n",
