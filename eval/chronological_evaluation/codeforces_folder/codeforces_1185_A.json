        "description": "Polycarp decided to relax on his weekend and visited to the performance of\nfamous ropewalkers: Agafon, Boniface and Konrad. The rope is straight and\ninfinite in both directions. At the beginning of the performance, Agafon,\nBoniface and Konrad are located in positions \n    a\n, \n    b\n and \n    c\n\nrespectively. At the end of the performance, the distance between each pair of\nropewalkers was at least \n    d\n. Ropewalkers can walk on the rope. In one\nsecond, only one ropewalker can change his position. Every ropewalker can\nchange his position exactly by \n    1\n (i. e. shift by \n    1\n to the left or\nright direction on the rope). Agafon, Boniface and Konrad can not move at the\nsame time (Only one of them can move at each moment). Ropewalkers can be at\nthe same positions at the same time and can \"walk past each other\". You should\nfind the minimum duration (in seconds) of the performance. In other words,\nfind the minimum number of seconds needed so that the distance between each\npair of ropewalkers can be greater or equal to \n    d\n. Ropewalkers can walk\nto negative coordinates, due to the rope is infinite to both sides. Input The\nonly line of the input contains four integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    c\n,\n\n    d\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b, c, d \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is possible that any two (or\nall three) ropewalkers are in the same position at the beginning of the\nperformance. Output Output one integer \u2014 the minimum duration (in seconds) of\nthe performance. Examples Input 5 2 6 3 Output 2 Input 3 1 5 6 Output 8 Input\n8 3 3 2 Output 2 Input 2 3 10 4 Output 3 Note In the first example: in the\nfirst two seconds Konrad moves for 2 positions to the right (to the position\n\n    8\n), while Agafon and Boniface stay at their positions. Thus, the\ndistance between Agafon and Boniface will be \n    |5 - 2| = 3\n, the distance\nbetween Boniface and Konrad will be \n    |2 - 8| = 6\n and the distance between\nAgafon and Konrad will be \n    |5 - 8| = 3\n. Therefore, all three pairwise\ndistances will be at least \n    d=3\n, so the performance could be finished\nwithin 2 seconds.\n\n",
