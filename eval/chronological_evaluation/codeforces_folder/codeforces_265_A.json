        "description": "There is a sequence of colorful stones. The color of each stone is one of red,\ngreen, or blue. You are given a string s. The i-th (1-based) character of s\nrepresents the color of the i-th stone. If the character is \"R\", \"G\", or \"B\",\nthe color of the corresponding stone is red, green, or blue, respectively.\nInitially Squirrel Liss is standing on the first stone. You perform\ninstructions one or more times. Each instruction is one of the three types:\n\"RED\", \"GREEN\", or \"BLUE\". After an instruction c, if Liss is standing on a\nstone whose colors is c, Liss will move one stone forward, else she will not\nmove. You are given a string t. The number of instructions is equal to the\nlength of t, and the i-th character of t represents the i-th instruction.\nCalculate the final position of Liss (the number of the stone she is going to\nstand on in the end) after performing all the instructions, and print its\n1-based position. It is guaranteed that Liss don't move out of the sequence.\nInput The input contains two lines. The first line contains the string s (1 \u2264\n|s| \u2264 50). The second line contains the string t (1 \u2264 |t| \u2264 50). The\ncharacters of each string will be one of \"R\", \"G\", or \"B\". It is guaranteed\nthat Liss don't move out of the sequence. Output Print the final 1-based\nposition of Liss in a single line.
