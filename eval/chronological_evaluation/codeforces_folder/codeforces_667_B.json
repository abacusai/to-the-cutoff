        "description": "As some of you know, cubism is a trend in art, where the problem of\nconstructing volumetrical shape on a plane with a combination of three-\ndimensional geometric shapes comes to the fore. A famous sculptor Cicasso,\nwhose self-portrait you can contemplate, hates cubism. He is more impressed by\nthe idea to transmit two-dimensional objects through three-dimensional objects\nby using his magnificent sculptures. And his new project is connected with\nthis. Cicasso wants to make a coat for the haters of anticubism. To do this,\nhe wants to create a sculpture depicting a well-known geometric primitive \u2014\nconvex polygon. Cicasso prepared for this a few blanks, which are rods with\ninteger lengths, and now he wants to bring them together. The i-th rod is a\nsegment of length li. The sculptor plans to make a convex polygon with a\nnonzero area, using all rods he has as its sides. Each rod should be used as a\nside to its full length. It is forbidden to cut, break or bend rods. However,\ntwo sides may form a straight angle . Cicasso knows that it is impossible to\nmake a convex polygon with a nonzero area out of the rods with the lengths\nwhich he had chosen. Cicasso does not want to leave the unused rods, so the\nsculptor decides to make another rod-blank with an integer length so that his\nproblem is solvable. Of course, he wants to make it as short as possible,\nbecause the materials are expensive, and it is improper deed to spend money\nfor nothing. Help sculptor! Input The first line contains an integer n (3 \u2264 n\n\u2264 10^5) \u2014 a number of rod-blanks. The second line contains n integers li (1 \u2264\nli \u2264 10^9) \u2014 lengths of rods, which Cicasso already has. It is guaranteed that\nit is impossible to make a polygon with n vertices and nonzero area using the\nrods Cicasso already has. Output Print the only integer z \u2014 the minimum length\nof the rod, so that after adding it it can be possible to construct convex\npolygon with (n + 1) vertices and nonzero area from all of the rods. Examples\nInput 3 1 2 1 Output 1 Input 5 20 4 3 2 1 Output 11 Note In the first example\ntriangle with sides 1 + 1 = 2, 2, 1 can be formed from a set of lengths 1,\n1, 1, 2. In the second example you can make a triangle with lengths 20, 11,\n4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10.\n\n",
