        "description": "Demiurges Shambambukli and Mazukta love to watch the games of ordinary people.\nToday, they noticed two men who play the following game. There is a rooted\ntree on n nodes, m of which are leaves (a leaf is a nodes that does not have\nany children), edges of the tree are directed from parent to children. In the\nleaves of the tree integers from 1 to m are placed in such a way that each\nnumber appears exactly in one leaf. Initially, the root of the tree contains a\npiece. Two players move this piece in turns, during a move a player moves the\npiece from its current nodes to one of its children; if the player can not\nmake a move, the game ends immediately. The result of the game is the number\nplaced in the leaf where a piece has completed its movement. The player who\nmakes the first move tries to maximize the result of the game and the second\nplayer, on the contrary, tries to minimize the result. We can assume that both\nplayers move optimally well. Demiurges are omnipotent, so before the game they\ncan arbitrarily rearrange the numbers placed in the leaves. Shambambukli wants\nto rearrange numbers so that the result of the game when both players play\noptimally well is as large as possible, and Mazukta wants the result to be as\nsmall as possible. What will be the outcome of the game, if the numbers are\nrearranged by Shambambukli, and what will it be if the numbers are rearranged\nby Mazukta? Of course, the Demiurges choose the best possible option of\narranging numbers. Input The first line contains a single integer n \u2014 the\nnumber of nodes in the tree (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5). Each of the next n - 1 lines\ncontains two integers ui and vi (1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264 n) \u2014 the ends of the edge of the\ntree; the edge leads from node ui to node vi. It is guaranteed that the\ndescribed graph is a rooted tree, and the root is the node 1. Output Print two\nspace-separated integers \u2014 the maximum possible and the minimum possible\nresult of the game. Examples Input 5 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 Output 3 2 Input 6 1 2 1\n3 3 4 1 5 5 6 Output 3 3 Note Consider the first sample. The tree contains\nthree leaves: 3, 4 and 5. If we put the maximum number 3 at node 3, then the\nfirst player moves there and the result will be 3. On the other hand, it is\neasy to see that for any rearrangement the first player can guarantee the\nresult of at least 2. In the second sample no matter what the arragment is the\nfirst player can go along the path that ends with a leaf with number 3.\n\n",
