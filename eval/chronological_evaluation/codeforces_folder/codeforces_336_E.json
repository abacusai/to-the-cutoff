        "name": "Vasily the Bear and Painting Square",
        "description": "Vasily the bear has two favorite integers n and k and a pencil. Besides, he's\ngot k jars with different water color paints. All jars are numbered in some\nmanner from 1 to k, inclusive. The jar number i contains the paint of the i-th\ncolor. Initially the bear took a pencil and drew four segments on the\ncoordinate plane. All of them end at point (0, 0). They begin at: (0, 2^n),\n(0, - 2^n), (2^n, 0), ( - 2^n, 0). Then for each i = 1, 2, ..., n, the bear\ndrew two squares. The first square has the following vertex coordinates: (2^i,\n0), ( - 2^i, 0), (0, - 2^i), (0, 2^i). The second square has the following\nvertex coordinates: ( - 2^i-1, - 2^i-1), ( - 2^i-1, 2^i-1), (2^i-1, - 2^i-1),\n(2^i-1, 2^i-1). After that, the bear drew another square: (1, 0), ( - 1, 0),\n(0, - 1), (0, 1). All points mentioned above form the set of points A. The\nsample of the final picture at n = 0 The sample of the final picture at n = 2\nThe bear decided to paint the resulting picture in k moves. The i-th move\nconsists of the following stages: The bear chooses 3 distinct points in set \u0410\nso that any pair of the chosen points has a segment on the picture between\nthem. The chosen points and segments mark the area that mustn't contain any\npreviously painted points. The bear paints the area bounded by the chosen\npoints and segments the i-th color. Note that after the k-th move some parts\nof the picture can stay unpainted. The bear asked you to calculate, how many\ndistinct ways there are to paint his picture. A way to paint the picture is a\nsequence of three-element sets of points he chose on each step. Two sequences\nare considered distinct if there is such number i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k), that the i-th\nmembers of these sequences do not coincide as sets. As the sought number can\nbe rather large, you only need to calculate the remainder after dividing it by\nnumber 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Input The first line contains two integers n and\nk, separated by a space (0 \u2264 n, k \u2264 200). Output Print exactly one integer \u2014\nthe answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Examples Input 0 0\nOutput 1 Input 0 1 Output 8 Input 0 2 Output 32 Input 1 1 Output 32\n\n",
