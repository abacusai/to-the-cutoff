        "description": "You are given an undirected graph of \n    n\n vertices indexed from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n, where vertex \n    i\n has a value \n    a_i\n assigned to it and all\nvalues \n    a_i\n are different. There is an edge between two vertices \n    u\n\nand \n    v\n if either \n    a_u\n divides \n    a_v\n or \n    a_v\n divides\n\n    a_u\n. Find the minimum number of vertices to remove such that the\nremaining graph is bipartite, when you remove a vertex you remove all the\nedges incident to it. Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first\nline of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    5\n    \u00b710^4\n) \u2014 the number of vertices in the graph. The second line of\neach test case contains \n    n\n integers, the \n    i\n-th of them is the value\n\n    a_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 5\n    \u00b710^4\n) assigned to the \n    i\n-th\nvertex, all values \n    a_i\n are different. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    5\n    \u00b710^4\n. Output For\neach test case print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of vertices to\nremove such that the remaining graph is bipartite.

BeforeAfter test case #3\nIn the fourth test case we remove the vertices with values \n    2\n and\n\n    195\n, so the answer is \n    2\n. BeforeAfter test case #4\n\n",
