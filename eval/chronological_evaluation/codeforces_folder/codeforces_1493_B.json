        "description": "The time on the planet Lapituletti goes the same way it goes on Earth but a\nday lasts \n    h\n hours and each hour lasts \n    m\n minutes. The inhabitants\nof that planet use digital clocks similar to earth ones. Clocks display time\nin a format HH:MM (the number of hours in decimal is displayed first, then\n(after the colon) follows the number of minutes in decimal; the number of\nminutes and hours is written with leading zeros if needed to form a two-digit\nnumber). Hours are numbered from \n    0\n to \n    h-1\n and minutes are numbered\nfrom \n    0\n to \n    m-1\n. That's how the digits are displayed on the clock.\nPlease note that digit \n    1\n is placed in the middle of its position. A\nstandard mirror is in use on the planet Lapituletti. Inhabitants often look at\nthe reflection of the digital clocks in the mirror and feel happy when what\nyou see on the reflected clocks is a valid time (that means that you see valid\ndigits in the reflection and this time can be seen on the normal clocks at\nsome moment of a day). The image of the clocks in the mirror is reflected\nagainst a vertical axis. The reflection is not a valid time. The reflection is\na valid time with \n    h=24\n, \n    m = 60\n. However, for example, if\n\n    h=10\n, \n    m=60\n, then the reflection is not a valid time. An inhabitant\nof the planet Lapituletti begins to look at a mirrored image of the clocks at\nsome time moment \n    s\n and wants to know the nearest future time moment\n(which can possibly happen on the next day), when the reflected clock time is\nvalid. It can be shown that with any \n    h\n, \n    m\n, \n    s\n such a moment\nexists. If the reflected time is correct at the moment the inhabitant began to\nlook at the clock, that moment is considered the nearest. You are asked to\nsolve the problem for several test cases. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe next \n    2 \n    \u00b7 T\n lines contain the description of test cases. The\ndescription of each test case consists of two lines. The first line of a test\ncase contains two integers \n    h\n, \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 h, m \n    \u2264 100\n).\nThe second line contains the start time \n    s\n in the described format HH:MM.\nOutput For each test case output in a separate line the nearest moment in\nformat HH:MM when the reflected time is correct. Example Input 5 24 60 12:21\n24 60 23:59 90 80 52:26 1 100 00:01 10 10 04:04 Output 12:21 00:00 52:28 00:00\n00:00 Note In the second test case it is not hard to show that the reflection\nof 23:59 is incorrect, while the reflection of the moment 00:00 on the next\nday is correct.\n\n",
