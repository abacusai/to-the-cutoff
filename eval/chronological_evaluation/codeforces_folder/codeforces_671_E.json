        "description": "Kekoland is a country with n beautiful cities numbered from left to right and\nconnected by n - 1 roads. The i-th road connects cities i and i + 1 and length\nof this road is wi kilometers. When you drive in Kekoland, each time you\narrive in city i by car you immediately receive gi liters of gas. There is no\nother way to get gas in Kekoland. You were hired by the Kekoland president\nKeko to organize the most beautiful race Kekoland has ever seen. Let race be\nbetween cities l and r (l \u2264 r). Race will consist of two stages. On the first\nstage cars will go from city l to city r. After completing first stage, next\nday second stage will be held, now racers will go from r to l with their cars.\nOf course, as it is a race, racers drive directly from start city to finish\ncity. It means that at the first stage they will go only right, and at the\nsecond stage they go only left. Beauty of the race between l and r is equal to\nr - l + 1 since racers will see r - l + 1 beautiful cities of Kekoland. Cars\nhave infinite tank so racers will take all the gas given to them. At the\nbeginning of each stage racers start the race with empty tank (0 liters of\ngasoline). They will immediately take their gasoline in start cities (l for\nthe first stage and r for the second stage) right after the race starts. It\nmay not be possible to organize a race between l and r if cars will run out of\ngas before they reach finish. You have k presents. Each time you give a\npresent to city i its value gi increases by 1. You may distribute presents\namong cities in any way (also give many presents to one city, each time\nincreasing gi by 1). What is the most beautiful race you can organize? Each\ncar consumes 1 liter of gas per one kilometer. Input The first line of the\ninput contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the\nnumber of cities in Kekoland and the number of presents you have,\nrespectively. Next line contains n - 1 integers. The i-th of them is wi (1 \u2264\nwi \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the length of the road between city i and i + 1. Next line\ncontains n integers. The i-th of them is gi (0 \u2264 gi \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the amount of\ngas you receive every time you enter city i. Output Print a single line \u2014 the\nbeauty of the most beautiful race you can organize. Examples Input 4 4 2 2 2 1\n1 1 1 Output 4 Input 8 5 2 2 2 3 7 3 1 1 3 1 5 4 0 2 5 Output 7 Note In first\nsample if you give one present to each city then it will be possible to make a\nrace between city 1 and city 4. In second sample you should add 1 to g5 and 4\nto g6, then it will be possible to make a race between cities 2 and 8.\n\n",
