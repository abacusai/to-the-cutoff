        "description": "An undirected graph is called k-regular, if the degrees of all its vertices\nare equal k. An edge of a connected graph is called a bridge, if after\nremoving it the graph is being split into two connected components. Build a\nconnected undirected k-regular graph containing at least one bridge, or else\nstate that such graph doesn't exist. Input The single line of the input\ncontains integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 100) \u2014 the required degree of the vertices of the\nregular graph. Output Print \"NO\" (without quotes), if such graph doesn't\nexist. Otherwise, print \"YES\" in the first line and the description of any\nsuitable graph in the next lines. The description of the made graph must start\nwith numbers n and m \u2014 the number of vertices and edges respectively. Each of\nthe next m lines must contain two integers, a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n, a \u2260 b),\nthat mean that there is an edge connecting the vertices a and b. A graph\nshouldn't contain multiple edges and edges that lead from a vertex to itself.\nA graph must be connected, the degrees of all vertices of the graph must be\nequal k. At least one edge of the graph must be a bridge. You can print the\nedges of the graph in any order. You can print the ends of each edge in any\norder. The constructed graph must contain at most 10^6 vertices and 10^6 edges\n(it is guaranteed that if at least one graph that meets the requirements\nexists, then there also exists the graph with at most 10^6 vertices and at\nmost 10^6 edges). Examples Input 1 Output YES 2 1 1 2 Note In the sample from\nthe statement there is a suitable graph consisting of two vertices, connected\nby a single edge.\n\n",
