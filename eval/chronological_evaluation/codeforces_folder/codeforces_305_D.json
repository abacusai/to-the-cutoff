        "description": "Olya has got a directed non-weighted graph, consisting of n vertexes and m\nedges. We will consider that the graph vertexes are indexed from 1 to n in\nsome manner. Then for any graph edge that goes from vertex v to vertex u the\nfollowing inequation holds: v < u. Now Olya wonders, how many ways there are\nto add an arbitrary (possibly zero) number of edges to the graph so as the\nfollowing conditions were met: You can reach vertexes number i + 1, i + 2,\n..., n from any vertex number i (i < n). For any graph edge going from vertex\nv to vertex u the following inequation fulfills: v < u. There is at most one\nedge between any two vertexes. The shortest distance between the pair of\nvertexes i, j (i < j), for which j - i \u2264 k holds, equals j - i edges. The\nshortest distance between the pair of vertexes i, j (i < j), for which j - i >\nk holds, equals either j - i or j - i - k edges. We will consider two ways\ndistinct, if there is the pair of vertexes i, j (i < j), such that first\nresulting graph has an edge from i to j and the second one doesn't have it.\nHelp Olya. As the required number of ways can be rather large, print it modulo\n1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Input The first line contains three space-separated\nintegers n, m, k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^6). The next m lines\ncontain the description of the edges of the initial graph. The i-th line\ncontains a pair of space-separated integers ui, vi (1 \u2264 ui < vi \u2264 n) \u2014 the\nnumbers of vertexes that have a directed edge from ui to vi between them. It\nis guaranteed that any pair of vertexes ui, vi has at most one edge between\nthem. It also is guaranteed that the graph edges are given in the order of\nnon-decreasing ui. If there are multiple edges going from vertex ui, then it\nis guaranteed that these edges are given in the order of increasing vi. Output\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (10^9 +\n7). Examples Input 7 8 2 1 2 2 3 3 4 3 6 4 5 4 7 5 6 6 7 Output 2 Input 7 0 2\nOutput 12 Input 7 2 1 1 3 3 5 Output 0 Note In the first sample there are two\nways: the first way is not to add anything, the second way is to add a single\nedge from vertex 2 to vertex 5.\n\n",
