        "description": "There is a road with length \n    l\n meters. The start of the road has\ncoordinate \n    0\n, the end of the road has coordinate \n    l\n. There are two\ncars, the first standing at the start of the road and the second standing at\nthe end of the road. They will start driving simultaneously. The first car\nwill drive from the start to the end and the second car will drive from the\nend to the start. Initially, they will drive with a speed of \n    1\n meter per\nsecond. There are \n    n\n flags at different coordinates \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n. Each time when any of two cars drives through a flag, the\nspeed of that car increases by \n    1\n meter per second. Find how long will it\ntake for cars to meet (to reach the same coordinate). Input The first line\ncontains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n): the number of\ntest cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n,\n\n    l\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 10^9\n): the\nnumber of flags and the length of the road. The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n in the increasing order (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    a_1 < a_2 < \n    \u2026 < a_n < l\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n\namong all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case\nprint a single real number: the time required for cars to meet. Your answer\nwill be considered correct, if its absolute or relative error does not exceed\n\n    10^-6\n. More formally, if your answer is \n    a\n and jury's answer is\n\n    b\n, your answer will be considered correct if\n\n    |a-b|/\n    max(1, b)\n    \u2264 10^-6\n.

The first car will be in the coordinate\n\n    1\n in \n    1\n second and after that its speed will increase by \n    1\n\nand will be equal to \n    2\n meters per second. After \n    2\n more seconds it\nwill be in the coordinate \n    5\n. So, it will be in the coordinate \n    5\n in\n\n    3\n seconds. The second car will be in the coordinate \n    9\n in \n    1\n\nsecond and after that its speed will increase by \n    1\n and will be equal to\n\n    2\n meters per second. After \n    2\n more seconds it will be in the\ncoordinate \n    5\n. So, it will be in the coordinate \n    5\n in \n    3\n\nseconds. In the second test case after \n    1\n second the first car will be in\nthe coordinate \n    1\n and will have the speed equal to \n    2\n meters per\nsecond, the second car will be in the coordinate \n    9\n and will have the\nspeed equal to \n    1\n meter per second. So, they will meet after\n\n    9-1/2+1 = \n    8/3\n seconds. So, the answer is equal to\n\n    1 + \n    8/3 = \n    11/3\n.\n\n",
