        "description": "In a certain video game, the player controls a hero characterized by a single\ninteger value: power. The hero will have to beat monsters that are also\ncharacterized by a single integer value: armor. On the current level, the hero\nis facing \n    n\n caves. To pass the level, the hero must enter all the caves\nin some order, each cave exactly once, and exit every cave safe and sound.\nWhen the hero enters cave \n    i\n, he will have to fight \n    k_i\n monsters in\na row: first a monster with armor \n    a_i, 1\n, then a monster with armor\n\n    a_i, 2\n and so on, finally, a monster with armor \n    a_i, k_i\n. The\nhero can beat a monster if and only if the hero's power is strictly greater\nthan the monster's armor. If the hero can't beat the monster he's fighting,\nthe game ends and the player loses. Note that once the hero enters a cave, he\ncan't exit it before he fights all the monsters in it, strictly in the given\norder. Each time the hero beats a monster, the hero's power increases by\n\n    1\n. Find the smallest possible power the hero must start the level with\nto be able to enter all the caves in some order and beat all the monsters.\nInput Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the\nnumber of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n). Description of the\ntest cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of caves. The \n    i\n-th of\nthe next \n    n\n lines contains an integer \n    k_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k_i \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of monsters in the \n    i\n-th cave, followed by\n\n    k_i\n integers \n    a_i, 1, a_i, 2, \n    \u2026, a_i, k_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    a_i, j\n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 armor levels of the monsters in cave \n    i\n in\norder the hero has to fight them. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    k_i\n\nover all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case\nprint a single integer \u2014 the smallest possible power the hero must start the\nlevel with to be able to enter all the caves in some order and beat all the\nmonsters. Example Input 2 1 1 42 2 3 10 15 8 2 12 11 Output 43 13 Note In the\nfirst test case, the hero has to beat a single monster with armor \n    42\n,\nit's enough to have power \n    43\n to achieve that. In the second test case,\nthe hero can pass the level with initial power \n    13\n as follows: enter cave\n\n    2\n: beat a monster with armor \n    12\n, power increases to \n    14\n; beat\na monster with armor \n    11\n, power increases to \n    15\n; enter cave\n\n    1\n: beat a monster with armor \n    10\n, power increases to \n    16\n; beat\na monster with armor \n    15\n, power increases to \n    17\n; beat a monster\nwith armor \n    8\n, power increases to \n    18\n.\n\n",
