        "description": "Heidi is a statistician to the core, and she likes to study the evolution of\nmarmot populations in each of V (1 \u2264 V \u2264 100) villages! So it comes that every\nspring, when Heidi sees the first snowdrops sprout in the meadows around her\nbarn, she impatiently dons her snowshoes and sets out to the Alps, to welcome\nher friends the marmots to a new season of thrilling adventures. Arriving in a\nvillage, Heidi asks each and every marmot she comes across for the number of\ninhabitants of that village. This year, the marmots decide to play an April\nFools' joke on Heidi. Instead of consistently providing the exact number of\ninhabitants P (10 \u2264 P \u2264 1000) of the village, they respond with a random non-\nnegative integer k, drawn from one of two types of probability distributions:\nPoisson (d'avril) distribution: the probability of getting an answer k is for\nk = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., Uniform distribution: the probability of getting an\nanswer k is for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 2P. Heidi collects exactly 250 answers per\nvillage. Every village follows either the Poisson or the uniform distribution.\nHeidi cannot tell marmots apart, so she may query some marmots several times,\nand each time the marmot will answer with a new number drawn from the\nvillage's distribution. Can you help Heidi to find out whether a village\nfollows a Poisson or a uniform distribution? Input The first line of input\nwill contain the number of villages V (1 \u2264 V \u2264 100). The following V lines\neach describe one village. The description of each village consists of 250\nspace-separated integers k, drawn from one of the above distributions. Output\nOutput one line per village, in the same order as provided in the input. The\nvillage's line shall state poisson if the village's distribution is of the\nPoisson type, and uniform if the answer came from a uniform distribution.\nExample Input 2 92 100 99 109 93 105 103 106 101 99 ... (input is truncated)\n28 180 147 53 84 80 180 85 8 16 ... (input is truncated) Output poisson\nuniform Note The full example input is visually represented below, along with\nthe probability distribution function it was drawn from (the y-axis is labeled\nby its values multiplied by 250).\n\n",
