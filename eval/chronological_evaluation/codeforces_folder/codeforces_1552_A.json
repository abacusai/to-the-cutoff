        "description": "A string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n, consisting of lowercase letters of the\nEnglish alphabet, is given. You must choose some number \n    k\n between\n\n    0\n and \n    n\n. Then, you select \n    k\n characters of \n    s\n and\npermute them however you want. In this process, the positions of the other\n\n    n-k\n characters remain unchanged. You have to perform this operation\nexactly once. For example, if \n    s=\n, you can choose the\n\n    k=4\n characters \n    \n and permute them into\n\n    \n so that after the operation the string becomes\n\n    \n. Determine the minimum \n    k\n so that it is\npossible to sort \n    s\n alphabetically (that is, after the operation its\ncharacters appear in alphabetical order). Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of each test case\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 40\n) \u2014 the length of the\nstring. The second line of each test case contains the string \n    s\n. It is\nguaranteed that \n    s\n contains only lowercase letters of the English\nalphabet. Output For each test case, output the minimum \n    k\n that allows\nyou to obtain a string sorted alphabetically, through the operation described\nabove. Example Input 4 3 lol 10 codeforces 5 aaaaa 4 dcba Output 2 6 0 4 Note\nIn the first test case, we can choose the \n    k=2\n characters\n\n    \n and rearrange them as \n    \n (so the\nresulting string is \n    \n). It is not possible to sort the\nstring choosing strictly less than \n    2\n characters. In the second test\ncase, one possible way to sort \n    s\n is to consider the \n    k=6\n characters\n\n    \n and rearrange them as\n\n    \n (so the resulting string is\n\n    \n). One can show that it is not possible to sort\nthe string choosing strictly less than \n    6\n characters. In the third test\ncase, string \n    s\n is already sorted (so we can choose \n    k=0\n\ncharacters). In the fourth test case, we can choose all \n    k=4\n characters\n\n    \n and reverse the whole string (so the resulting string\nis \n    \n).\n\n",
