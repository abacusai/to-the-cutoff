        "description": "You have n devices that you want to use simultaneously. The i-th device uses\nai units of power per second. This usage is continuous. That is, in \u03bb seconds,\nthe device will use \u03bb\u00b7ai units of power. The i-th device currently has bi\nunits of power stored. All devices can store an arbitrary amount of power. You\nhave a single charger that can plug to any single device. The charger will add\np units of power per second to a device. This charging is continuous. That is,\nif you plug in a device for \u03bb seconds, it will gain \u03bb\u00b7p units of power. You\ncan switch which device is charging at any arbitrary unit of time (including\nreal numbers), and the time it takes to switch is negligible. You are\nwondering, what is the maximum amount of time you can use the devices until\none of them hits 0 units of power. If you can use the devices indefinitely,\nprint -1. Otherwise, print the maximum amount of time before any one device\nhits 0 power. Input The first line contains two integers, n and p (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100\n000, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of devices and the power of the charger. This\nis followed by n lines which contain two integers each. Line i contains the\nintegers ai and bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the power of the device and the\namount of power stored in the device in the beginning. Output If you can use\nthe devices indefinitely, print -1. Otherwise, print the maximum amount of\ntime before any one device hits 0 power. Your answer will be considered\ncorrect if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^-4. Namely, let's\nassume that your answer is a and the answer of the jury is b. The checker\nprogram will consider your answer correct if . Examples Input 2 1 2 2 2 1000\nOutput 2.0000000000 Input 1 100 1 1 Output -1 Input 3 5 4 3 5 2 6 1 Output\n0.5000000000 Note In sample test 1, you can charge the first device for the\nentire time until it hits zero power. The second device has enough power to\nlast this time without being charged. In sample test 2, you can use the device\nindefinitely. In sample test 3, we can charge the third device for 2 / 5 of a\nsecond, then switch to charge the second device for a 1 / 10 of a second.\n\n",
