        "description": "Yaroslav, Andrey and Roman love playing cubes. Sometimes they get together and\nplay cubes for hours and hours! Today they got together again and they are\nplaying cubes. Yaroslav took unit cubes and composed them into an a \u00d7 a \u00d7 a\ncube, Andrey made a b \u00d7 b \u00d7 b cube and Roman made a c \u00d7 c \u00d7 c cube. After that\nthe game was finished and the guys left. But later, Vitaly entered the room.\nHe saw the cubes and wanted to make a cube as well. But what size should the\ncube be? Of course it should be a large cube with the side of length a + b +\nc. Besides, Vitaly decided to decompose the cubes built by Yaroslav, Andrey\nand Roman and compose his own large cube out of them. However, it turned out\nthat the unit cubes he got from destroying the three cubes just weren't enough\nto make a large cube. We know that Vitaly was short of exactly n cubes. Vitaly\ngot upset, demolished everything and left. As he was leaving, he met Petya and\ntold him that there had been three cubes in the room and that he needed\nanother n unit cubes to make his own large cube. Petya entered the room and\nsaw the messily scattered cubes. He wanted to make it neat and orderly again.\nBut he only knows that there had been three cubes, made of small unit cubes\nand that Vitaly needed n more unit cubes to make a large one! Help Petya\nunderstand, how many ways of sizes a, b, c are there to restore Yaroslav's,\nAndrey's and Roman's cubes. Input The single line of the input contains\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^14). We know that all numbers a, b, c are positive\nintegers. Please, do not use the \nintegers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the \nspecifier. Output In the single line print the required number of ways. If it\nturns out that there isn't a single way of suitable sizes of a, b, c, print 0.\nExamples Input 24 Output 1 Input 648 Output 7 Input 5 Output 0 Input\n93163582512000 Output 39090\n\n",
