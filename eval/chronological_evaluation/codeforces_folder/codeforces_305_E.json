        "description": "Two people play the following string game. Initially the players have got some\nstring s. The players move in turns, the player who cannot make a move loses.\nBefore the game began, the string is written on a piece of paper, one letter\nper cell. An example of the initial situation at s = \"abacaba\" A player's move\nis the sequence of actions: The player chooses one of the available pieces of\npaper with some string written on it. Let's denote it is t. Note that\ninitially, only one piece of paper is available. The player chooses in the\nstring t = t1t2... t|t| character in position i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 |t|) such that for\nsome positive integer l (0 < i - l; i + l \u2264 |t|) the following equations hold:\nti - 1 = ti + 1, ti - 2 = ti + 2, ..., ti - l = ti + l. Player cuts the cell\nwith the chosen character. As a result of the operation, he gets three new\npieces of paper, the first one will contain string t1t2... ti - 1, the second\none will contain a string consisting of a single character ti, the third one\ncontains string ti + 1ti + 2... t|t|. An example of making action (i = 4) with\nstring s = \u00ababacaba\u00bb Your task is to determine the winner provided that both\nplayers play optimally well. If the first player wins, find the position of\ncharacter that is optimal to cut in his first move. If there are multiple\npositions, print the minimal possible one. Input The first line contains\nstring s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 5000). It is guaranteed that string s only contains\nlowercase English letters. Output If the second player wins, print in the\nsingle line \"Second\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print in the first line\n\"First\" (without the quotes), and in the second line print the minimal\npossible winning move \u2014 integer i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 |s|). Examples Input abacaba Output\nFirst 2 Input abcde Output Second Note In the first sample the first player\nhas multiple winning moves. But the minimum one is to cut the character in\nposition 2. In the second sample the first player has no available moves.\n\n",
