        "description": "Marin wants you to count number of permutations that are beautiful. A\nbeautiful permutation of length \n    n\n is a permutation that has the\nfollowing property: \n    \n\n    (1 \n    \u00b7 p_1, \n      2 \n    \u00b7 p_2, \n     \n    \u2026, \n      n \n    \u00b7 p_n) > 1,\n\n    \n where \n    \n is the greatest\ncommon divisor. A permutation is an array consisting of \n    n\n distinct\nintegers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n in arbitrary order. For example,\n\n    [2,3,1,5,4]\n is a permutation, but \n    [1,2,2]\n is not a permutation\n(\n    2\n appears twice in the array) and \n    [1,3, 4]\n is also not a\npermutation (\n    n=3\n but there is \n    4\n in the array). Input The first\nline contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. Each test case consists of one line containing one integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^3\n). Output For each test case, print one integer \u2014\nnumber of beautiful permutations. Because the answer can be very big, please\nprint the answer modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Example Input 7 1 2 3 4 5 6\n1000 Output 0 1 0 4 0 36 665702330 Note In first test case, we only have one\npermutation which is \n    [1]\n but it is not beautiful because \n    (1\n    \n    \u00b7 1) = 1\n. In second test case, we only have one beautiful permutation\nwhich is \n    [2, 1]\n because \n    (1 \n    \u00b7 2, 2 \n    \u00b7 1) = 2\n.\n\n",
