        "description": "There are three friend living on the straight line Ox in Lineland. The first\nfriend lives at the point x1, the second friend lives at the point x2, and the\nthird friend lives at the point x3. They plan to celebrate the New Year\ntogether, so they need to meet at one point. What is the minimum total\ndistance they have to travel in order to meet at some point and celebrate the\nNew Year? It's guaranteed that the optimal answer is always integer. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains three distinct integers x1, x2 and x3 (1 \u2264\nx1, x2, x3 \u2264 100) \u2014 the coordinates of the houses of the first, the second and\nthe third friends respectively. Output Print one integer \u2014 the minimum total\ndistance the friends need to travel in order to meet together. Examples Input\n7 1 4 Output 6 Input 30 20 10 Output 20 Note In the first sample, friends\nshould meet at the point 4. Thus, the first friend has to travel the distance\nof 3 (from the point 7 to the point 4), the second friend also has to travel\nthe distance of 3 (from the point 1 to the point 4), while the third friend\nshould not go anywhere because he lives at the point 4.\n\n",
