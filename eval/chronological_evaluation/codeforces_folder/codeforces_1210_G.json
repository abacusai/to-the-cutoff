        "description": "Mateusz likes to travel! However, on his \n    42\nnd visit to Saint\nComputersburg there is not much left to sightsee. That's why he decided to go\nto an escape room with his friends! The team has solved all riddles\nflawlessly. There is only one riddle remaining \u2014 a huge circular table! There\nare \n    n\n weighing scales lying on top of the table, distributed along the\ncircle. Each scale is adjacent to exactly two other scales: for each \n    i\n    \n    \u2208\n    \n    1, 2, \n    \u2026, n-1\n, the \n    i\n-th and the \n    (i+1)\n-th\nscales are adjacent to each other, as well as the first and the \n    n\n-th\nscale. The \n    i\n-th scale initially contains \n    a_i\n heavy coins. Mateusz\ncan perform moves \u2014 each move consists of fetching a single coin from one\nscale and putting it on any adjacent scale. It turns out that the riddle will\nbe solved when there is a specific amount of coins on each of the scales.\nSpecifically, each scale has parameters \n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n. If each coin\nlies on a single scale and for each \n    i\n, the \n    i\n-th scale contains at\nleast \n    l_i\n and at most \n    r_i\n coins, the riddle will be solved and\nMateusz's team will win! Mateusz is aiming for the best possible time.\nTherefore, he wants to solved the riddle as quickly as possible. What is the\nminimum possible number of moves required to fulfill all the conditions? Input\nThe first line contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 35\n     000\n) \u2014\nthe number of weighing scales in the circle. The following \n    n\n lines\ndescribe the scales. The \n    i\n-th of these lines describes the \n    i\n-th\nscale and consists of three integers \n    a_i, l_i, r_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    35\n     000\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 35\n     000\n). It's guaranteed\nthat the riddle is solvable, that is, \n    \u2211_i=1^n l_i \n    \u2264\n    \u2211_i=1^n a_i \n    \u2264\n    \u2211_i=1^n r_i\n. Output Output one integer \u2014\nthe minimum number of operations required to solve the riddle.
