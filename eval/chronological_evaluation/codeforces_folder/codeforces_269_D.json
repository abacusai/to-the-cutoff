        "name": "Maximum Waterfall",
        "description": "Emuskald was hired to design an artificial waterfall according to the latest\ntrends in landscape architecture. A modern artificial waterfall consists of\nmultiple horizontal panels affixed to a wide flat wall. The water flows down\nthe top of the wall from panel to panel until it reaches the bottom of the\nwall. The wall has height t and has n panels on the wall. Each panel is a\nhorizontal segment at height hi which begins at li and ends at ri. The i-th\npanel connects the points (li, hi) and (ri, hi) of the plane. The top of the\nwall can be considered a panel connecting the points ( - 10^9, t) and (10^9,\nt). Similarly, the bottom of the wall can be considered a panel connecting the\npoints ( - 10^9, 0) and (10^9, 0). No two panels share a common point.\nEmuskald knows that for the waterfall to be aesthetically pleasing, it can\nflow from panel i to panel j () only if the following conditions hold: max(li,\nlj) < min(ri, rj) (horizontal projections of the panels overlap); hj < hi\n(panel j is below panel i); there is no such panel k (hj < hk < hi) that the\nfirst two conditions hold for the pairs (i, k) and (k, j). Then the flow for\nis equal to min(ri, rj) - max(li, lj), the length of their horizontal\nprojection overlap. Emuskald has decided that in his waterfall the water will\nflow in a single path from top to bottom. If water flows to a panel (except\nthe bottom of the wall), the water will fall further to exactly one lower\npanel. The total amount of water flow in the waterfall is then defined as the\nminimum horizontal projection overlap between two consecutive panels in the\npath of the waterfall. Formally: the waterfall consists of a single path of\npanels ; the flow of the waterfall is the minimum flow in the path . To make a\ntruly great waterfall Emuskald must maximize this water flow, but there are\ntoo many panels and he is having a hard time planning his creation. Below is\nan example of a waterfall Emuskald wants: Help Emuskald maintain his\nreputation and find the value of the maximum possible water flow. Input The\nfirst line of input contains two space-separated integers n and t (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n10^5, 2 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9), the number of the panels excluding the top and the bottom\npanels, and the height of the wall. Each of the n following lines contain\nthree space-separated integers hi, li and ri (0 < hi < t, - 10^9 \u2264 li < ri \u2264\n10^9), the height, left and right ends of the i-th panel segment. It is\nguaranteed that no two segments share a common point. Output Output a single\ninteger \u2014 the maximum possible amount of water flow in the desired waterfall.\nExamples Input 5 6 4 1 6 3 2 7 5 9 11 3 10 15 1 13 16 Output 4 Input 6 5 4 2 8\n3 1 2 2 2 3 2 6 12 1 0 7 1 8 11 Output 2 Note The first test case corresponds\nto the picture.\n\n",
