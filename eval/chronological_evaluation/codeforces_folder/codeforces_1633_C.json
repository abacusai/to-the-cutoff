        "description": "Monocarp is playing a computer game. In this game, his character fights\ndifferent monsters. A fight between a character and a monster goes as follows.\nSuppose the character initially has health \n    h_C\n and attack \n    d_C\n; the\nmonster initially has health \n    h_M\n and attack \n    d_M\n. The fight\nconsists of several steps: the character attacks the monster, decreasing the\nmonster's health by \n    d_C\n; the monster attacks the character, decreasing\nthe character's health by \n    d_M\n; the character attacks the monster,\ndecreasing the monster's health by \n    d_C\n; the monster attacks the\ncharacter, decreasing the character's health by \n    d_M\n; and so on, until\nthe end of the fight. The fight ends when someone's health becomes non-\npositive (i. e. \n    0\n or less). If the monster's health becomes non-\npositive, the character wins, otherwise the monster wins. Monocarp's character\ncurrently has health equal to \n    h_C\n and attack equal to \n    d_C\n. He\nwants to slay a monster with health equal to \n    h_M\n and attack equal to\n\n    d_M\n. Before the fight, Monocarp can spend up to \n    k\n coins to upgrade\nhis character's weapon and/or armor; each upgrade costs exactly one coin, each\nweapon upgrade increases the character's attack by \n    w\n, and each armor\nupgrade increases the character's health by \n    a\n. Can Monocarp's character\nslay the monster if Monocarp spends coins on upgrades optimally? Input The\nfirst line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: The first\nline contains two integers \n    h_C\n and \n    d_C\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 h_C \n    \u2264\n    10^15\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 d_C \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the character's health and attack;\nThe second line contains two integers \n    h_M\n and \n    d_M\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 h_M\n    \n    \u2264 10^15\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 d_M \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the monster's health and\nattack; The third line contains three integers \n    k\n, \n    w\n and \n    a\n\n(\n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264 w \n    \u2264 10^4\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264\n    a \n    \u2264 10^10\n) \u2014 the maximum number of coins that Monocarp can spend, the\namount added to the character's attack with each weapon upgrade, and the\namount added to the character's health with each armor upgrade, respectively.\nThe sum of \n    k\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n.\nOutput For each test case, print YES if it is possible to slay the monster by\noptimally choosing the upgrades. Otherwise, print NO. Example Input 4 25 4 9\n20 1 1 10 25 4 12 20 1 1 10 100 1 45 2 0 4 10 9 2 69 2 4 2 7 Output YES NO YES\nYES Note In the first example, Monocarp can spend one coin to upgrade weapon\n(damage will be equal to \n    5\n), then health during battle will change as\nfollows: \n    (h_C, h_M) = (25, 9) \n    \u2192 (25, 4) \n    \u2192 (5, 4)\n    \n    \u2192 (5, -1)\n. The battle ended with Monocarp's victory. In the\nsecond example, Monocarp has no way to defeat the monster. In the third\nexample, Monocarp has no coins, so he can't buy upgrades. However, the initial\ncharacteristics are enough for Monocarp to win. In the fourth example,\nMonocarp has \n    4\n coins. To defeat the monster, he has to spend \n    2\n\ncoins to upgrade weapon and \n    2\n coins to upgrade armor.\n\n",
