        "description": "A prime number is a number which has exactly two distinct divisors: one and\nitself. For example, numbers 2, 7, 3 are prime, and 1, 6, 4 are not. The next\nprime number after x is the smallest prime number greater than x. For example,\nthe next prime number after 2 is 3, and the next prime number after 3 is 5.\nNote that there is exactly one next prime number after each number. So 5 is\nnot the next prime number for 2. One cold April morning Panoramix predicted\nthat soon Kakofonix will break free from his straitjacket, and this will be a\nblack day for the residents of the Gallic countryside. Panoramix's prophecy\ntells that if some day Asterix and Obelix beat exactly x Roman soldiers, where\nx is a prime number, and next day they beat exactly y Roman soldiers, where y\nis the next prime number after x, then it's time to wait for Armageddon, for\nnothing can shut Kakofonix up while he sings his infernal song. Yesterday the\nGauls beat n Roman soldiers and it turned out that the number n was prime!\nToday their victims were a troop of m Romans (m > n). Determine whether the\nGauls should wait for the black day after today's victory of Asterix and\nObelix? Input The first and only input line contains two positive integers \u2014 n\nand m (2 \u2264 n < m \u2264 50). It is guaranteed that n is prime. Pretests contain all\nthe cases with restrictions 2 \u2264 n < m \u2264 4. Output Print YES, if m is the next\nprime number after n, or NO otherwise. Examples Input 3 5 Output YES Input 7\n11 Output YES Input 7 9 Output NO\n\n",
