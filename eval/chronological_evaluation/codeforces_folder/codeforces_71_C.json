        "description": "There are n knights sitting at the Round Table at an equal distance from each\nother. Each of them is either in a good or in a bad mood. Merlin, the wizard\npredicted to King Arthur that the next month will turn out to be particularly\nfortunate if the regular polygon can be found. On all vertices of the polygon\nknights in a good mood should be located. Otherwise, the next month will bring\nmisfortunes. A convex polygon is regular if all its sides have same length and\nall his angles are equal. In this problem we consider only regular polygons\nwith at least 3 vertices, i. e. only nondegenerated. On a picture below some\nexamples of such polygons are present. Green points mean knights in a good\nmood. Red points mean ones in a bad mood. King Arthur knows the knights'\nmoods. Help him find out if the next month will be fortunate or not. Input The\nfirst line contains number n, which is the number of knights at the round\ntable (3 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The second line contains space-separated moods of all\nthe n knights in the order of passing them around the table. \"1\" means that\nthe knight is in a good mood an \"0\" means that he is in a bad mood. Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes if the following month will turn out to be\nlucky. Otherwise, print \"NO\". Examples Input 3 1 1 1 Output YES Input 6 1 0 1\n1 1 0 Output YES Input 6 1 0 0 1 0 1 Output NO\n\n",
