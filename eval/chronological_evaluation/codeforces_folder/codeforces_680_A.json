        "description": "A little bear Limak plays a game. He has five cards. There is one number\nwritten on each card. Each number is a positive integer. Limak can discard\n(throw out) some cards. His goal is to minimize the sum of numbers written on\nremaining (not discarded) cards. He is allowed to at most once discard two or\nthree cards with the same number. Of course, he won't discard cards if it's\nimpossible to choose two or three cards with the same number. Given five\nnumbers written on cards, cay you find the minimum sum of numbers on remaining\ncards? Input The only line of the input contains five integers t1, t2, t3, t4\nand t5 (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 100) \u2014 numbers written on cards. Output Print the minimum\npossible sum of numbers written on remaining cards. Examples Input 7 3 7 3 20\nOutput 26 Input 7 9 3 1 8 Output 28 Input 10 10 10 10 10 Output 20 Note In the\nfirst sample, Limak has cards with numbers 7, 3, 7, 3 and 20. Limak can do one\nof the following. Do nothing and the sum would be 7 + 3 + 7 + 3 + 20 = 40.\nRemove two cards with a number 7. The remaining sum would be 3 + 3 + 20 = 26.\nRemove two cards with a number 3. The remaining sum would be 7 + 7 + 20 = 34.\nYou are asked to minimize the sum so the answer is 26. In the second sample,\nit's impossible to find two or three cards with the same number. Hence, Limak\ndoes nothing and the sum is 7 + 9 + 1 + 3 + 8 = 28. In the third sample, all\ncards have the same number. It's optimal to discard any three cards. The sum\nof two remaining numbers is 10 + 10 = 20.\n\n",
