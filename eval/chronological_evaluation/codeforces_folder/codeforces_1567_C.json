        "description": "Alice has just learned addition. However, she hasn't learned the concept of\n\"carrying\" fully \u2014 instead of carrying to the next column, she carries to the\ncolumn two columns to the left. For example, the regular way to evaluate the\nsum \n    2039 + 2976\n would be as shown: However, Alice evaluates it as shown:\nIn particular, this is what she does: add \n    9\n and \n    6\n to make\n\n    15\n, and carry the \n    1\n to the column two columns to the left, i. e.\nto the column \"\n    0\n \n    9\n\"; add \n    3\n and \n    7\n to make \n    10\n and\ncarry the \n    1\n to the column two columns to the left, i. e. to the column\n\"\n    2\n \n    2\n\"; add \n    1\n, \n    0\n, and \n    9\n to make \n    10\n and\ncarry the \n    1\n to the column two columns to the left, i. e. to the column\nabove the plus sign; add \n    1\n, \n    2\n and \n    2\n to make \n    5\n; add\n\n    1\n to make \n    1\n. Thus, she ends up with the incorrect result of\n\n    15005\n.Alice comes up to Bob and says that she has added two numbers to\nget a result of \n    n\n. However, Bob knows that Alice adds in her own way.\nHelp Bob find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers such that when\nAlice adds them, she will get a result of \n    n\n. Note that pairs \n    (a,\n    b)\n and \n    (b, a)\n are considered different if \n    a \n     b\n. Input The\ninput consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of the test cases follows. The only line of each test case\ncontains an integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number Alice\nshows Bob. Output For each test case, output one integer \u2014 the number of\nordered pairs of positive integers such that when Alice adds them, she will\nget a result of \n    n\n. Example Input 5 100 12 8 2021 10000 Output 9 4 7 44\n99 Note In the first test case, when Alice evaluates any of the sums \n    1 +\n    9\n, \n    2 + 8\n, \n    3 + 7\n, \n    4 + 6\n, \n    5 + 5\n, \n    6 + 4\n, \n    7 +\n    3\n, \n    8 + 2\n, or \n    9 + 1\n, she will get a result of \n    100\n. The\npicture below shows how Alice evaluates \n    6 + 4\n:\n\n",
