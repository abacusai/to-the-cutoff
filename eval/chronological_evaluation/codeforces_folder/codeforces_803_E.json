        "description": "Each evening Roma plays online poker on his favourite website. The rules of\npoker on this website are a bit strange: there are always two players in a\nhand, there are no bets, and the winner takes 1 virtual bourle from the loser.\nLast evening Roma started to play poker. He decided to spend no more than k\nvirtual bourles \u2014 he will stop immediately if the number of his loses exceeds\nthe number of his wins by k. Also Roma will leave the game if he wins enough\nmoney for the evening, i.e. if the number of wins exceeds the number of loses\nby k. Next morning Roma found a piece of paper with a sequence on it\nrepresenting his results. Roma doesn't remember the results exactly, and some\ncharacters in the sequence are written in a way such that it's impossible to\nrecognize this character, so Roma can't recall whether he won k bourles or he\nlost. The sequence written by Roma is a string s consisting of characters W\n(Roma won the corresponding hand), L (Roma lost), D (draw) and ? (unknown\nresult). Roma wants to restore any valid sequence by changing all ? characters\nto W, L or D. The sequence is called valid if all these conditions are met: In\nthe end the absolute difference between the number of wins and loses is equal\nto k; There is no hand such that the absolute difference before this hand was\nequal to k. Help Roma to restore any such sequence. Input The first line\ncontains two numbers n (the length of Roma's sequence) and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264\n1000). The second line contains the sequence s consisting of characters W, L,\nD and ?. There are exactly n characters in this sequence. Output If there is\nno valid sequence that can be obtained from s by replacing all ? characters by\nW, L or D, print NO. Otherwise print this sequence. If there are multiple\nanswers, print any of them. Examples Input 3 2 L?? Output LDL Input 3 1 W??\nOutput NO Input 20 5 ?LLLLLWWWWW????????? Output WLLLLLWWWWWWWWLWLWDW\n\n",
