        "name": "Elevator or Stairs?",
        "description": "Masha lives in a multi-storey building, where floors are numbered with\npositive integers. Two floors are called adjacent if their numbers differ by\none. Masha decided to visit Egor. Masha lives on the floor \n    x\n, Egor on\nthe floor \n    y\n (not on the same floor with Masha). The house has a\nstaircase and an elevator. If Masha uses the stairs, it takes \n    t_1\n\nseconds for her to walk between adjacent floors (in each direction). The\nelevator passes between adjacent floors (in each way) in \n    t_2\n seconds.\nThe elevator moves with doors closed. The elevator spends \n    t_3\n seconds to\nopen or close the doors. We can assume that time is not spent on any action\nexcept moving between adjacent floors and waiting for the doors to open or\nclose. If Masha uses the elevator, it immediately goes directly to the desired\nfloor. Coming out of the apartment on her floor, Masha noticed that the\nelevator is now on the floor \n    z\n and has closed doors. Now she has to\nchoose whether to use the stairs or use the elevator. If the time that Masha\nneeds to get to the Egor's floor by the stairs is strictly less than the time\nit will take her using the elevator, then she will use the stairs, otherwise\nshe will choose the elevator. Help Mary to understand whether to use the\nelevator or the stairs. Input The only line contains six integers \n    x\n,\n\n    y\n, \n    z\n, \n    t_1\n, \n    t_2\n, \n    t_3\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x, y, z, t_1,\n    t_2, t_3 \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the floor Masha is at, the floor Masha wants to get\nto, the floor the elevator is located on, the time it takes Masha to pass\nbetween two floors by stairs, the time it takes the elevator to pass between\ntwo floors and the time it takes for the elevator to close or open the doors.\nIt is guaranteed that \n    x \n     y\n. Output If the time it will take to use\nthe elevator is not greater than the time it will take to use the stairs,\nprint \u00abYES\u00bb (without quotes), otherwise print \u00abNO> (without quotes). You can\nprint each letter in any case (upper or lower). Examples Input 5 1 4 4 2 1\nOutput YES Input 1 6 6 2 1 1 Output NO Input 4 1 7 4 1 2 Output YES Note In\nthe first example: If Masha goes by the stairs, the time she spends is \n    4\n    \n    \u00b7 4 = 16\n, because she has to go \n    4\n times between adjacent floors\nand each time she spends \n    4\n seconds. If she chooses the elevator, she\nwill have to wait \n    2\n seconds while the elevator leaves the \n    4\n-th\nfloor and goes to the \n    5\n-th. After that the doors will be opening for\nanother \n    1\n second. Then Masha will enter the elevator, and she will have\nto wait for \n    1\n second for the doors closing. Next, the elevator will\nspend \n    4 \n    \u00b7 2 = 8\n seconds going from the \n    5\n-th floor to the\n\n    1\n-st, because the elevator has to pass \n    4\n times between adjacent\nfloors and spends \n    2\n seconds each time. And finally, it will take another\n\n    1\n second before the doors are open and Masha can come out. Thus, all the\nway by elevator will take \n    2 + 1 + 1 + 8 + 1 = 13\n seconds, which is less\nthan \n    16\n seconds, so Masha has to choose the elevator. In the second\nexample, it is more profitable for Masha to use the stairs, because it will\ntake \n    13\n seconds to use the elevator, that is more than the \n    10\n\nseconds it will takes to go by foot. In the third example, the time it takes\nto use the elevator is equal to the time it takes to walk up by the stairs,\nand is equal to \n    12\n seconds. That means Masha will take the elevator.\n\n",
