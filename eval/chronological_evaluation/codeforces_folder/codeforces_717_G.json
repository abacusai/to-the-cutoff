        "description": "You have recently fallen through a hole and, after several hours of\nunconsciousness, have realized you are in an underground city. On one of your\nregular, daily walks through the unknown, you have encountered two unusually\nlooking skeletons called Sanz and P\u2019pairus, who decided to accompany you and\ngive you some puzzles for seemingly unknown reasons. One day, Sanz has created\na crossword for you. Not any kind of crossword, but a 1D crossword! You are\ngiven m words and a string of length n. You are also given an array p, which\ndesignates how much each word is worth \u2014 the i-th word is worth pi points.\nWhenever you find one of the m words in the string, you are given the\ncorresponding number of points. Each position in the crossword can be used at\nmost x times. A certain word can be counted at different places, but you\ncannot count the same appearance of a word multiple times. If a word is a\nsubstring of another word, you can count them both (presuming you haven\u2019t used\nthe positions more than x times). In order to solve the puzzle, you need to\ntell Sanz what\u2019s the maximum achievable number of points in the crossword.\nThere is no need to cover all postions, just get the maximal score! Crossword\nand words contain only lowercase English letters. Input The first line of the\ninput contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 500) \u2014 the length of the crossword.\nThe second line contains the crossword string. The third line contains a\nsingle integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of given words, and next m lines\ncontain description of words: each line will have a string representing a non-\nempty word (its length doesn't exceed the length of the crossword) and integer\npi (0 \u2264 pi \u2264 100). Last line of the input will contain x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 100) \u2014\nmaximum number of times a position in crossword can be used. Output Output\nsingle integer \u2014 maximum number of points you can get. Example Input 6 abacba\n2 aba 6 ba 3 3 Output 12 Note For example, with the string \"abacba\", words\n\"aba\" (6 points) and \"ba\" (3 points), and x = 3, you can get at most 12 points\n- the word \"aba\" appears once (\"abacba\"), while \"ba\" appears two times\n(\"abacba\"). Note that for x = 1, you could get at most 9 points, since you\nwouldn\u2019t be able to count both \"aba\" and the first appearance of \"ba\".\n\n",
