        "description": "Limak is a little polar bear. He plays by building towers from blocks. Every\nblock is a cube with positive integer length of side. Limak has infinitely\nmany blocks of each side length. A block with side a has volume a^3. A tower\nconsisting of blocks with sides a1, a2, ..., ak has the total volume a1^3 +\na2^3 + ... + ak^3. Limak is going to build a tower. First, he asks you to tell\nhim a positive integer X \u2014 the required total volume of the tower. Then, Limak\nadds new blocks greedily, one by one. Each time he adds the biggest block such\nthat the total volume doesn't exceed X. Limak asks you to choose X not greater\nthan m. Also, he wants to maximize the number of blocks in the tower at the\nend (however, he still behaves greedily). Secondarily, he wants to maximize X.\nCan you help Limak? Find the maximum number of blocks his tower can have and\nthe maximum X \u2264 m that results this number of blocks. Input The only line of\nthe input contains one integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^15), meaning that Limak wants you\nto choose X between 1 and m, inclusive. Output Print two integers \u2014 the\nmaximum number of blocks in the tower and the maximum required total volume X,\nresulting in the maximum number of blocks. Examples Input 48 Output 9 42 Input\n6 Output 6 6 Note In the first sample test, there will be 9 blocks if you\nchoose X = 23 or X = 42. Limak wants to maximize X secondarily so you should\nchoose 42. In more detail, after choosing X = 42 the process of building a\ntower is: Limak takes a block with side 3 because it's the biggest block with\nvolume not greater than 42. The remaining volume is 42 - 27 = 15. The second\nadded block has side 2, so the remaining volume is 15 - 8 = 7. Finally, Limak\nadds 7 blocks with side 1, one by one. So, there are 9 blocks in the tower.\nThe total volume is is 3^3 + 2^3 + 7\u00b71^3 = 27 + 8 + 7 = 42.\n\n",
