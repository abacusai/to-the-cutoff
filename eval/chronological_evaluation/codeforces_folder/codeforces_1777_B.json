        "description": "A permutation of length \n    n\n is an array consisting of \n    n\n distinct\nintegers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n in arbitrary order. For example,\n\n    [2,3,1,5,4]\n is a permutation, but \n    [1,2,2]\n is not a permutation\n(\n    2\n appears twice in the array), and \n    [1,3,4]\n is also not a\npermutation (\n    n=3\n but there is \n    4\n in the array). There are \n    n! = n\n    \n    \u00b7 (n-1) \n    \u00b7 (n - 2) \n    \u00b7\n    \u2026\n    \u00b7 1\n different\npermutations of length \n    n\n. Given a permutation \n    p\n of \n    n\n\nnumbers, we create an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    2n\n numbers, which is\nequal to \n    p\n concatenated with its reverse. We then define the beauty of\n\n    p\n as the number of inversions in \n    a\n. The number of inversions in\nthe array \n    a\n is the number of pairs of indices \n    i\n, \n    j\n such that\n\n    i < j\n and \n    a_i > a_j\n. For example, for permutation \n    p = [1,\n    2]\n, \n    a\n would be \n    [1, 2, 2, 1]\n. The inversions in \n    a\n are\n\n    (2, 4)\n and \n    (3, 4)\n (assuming 1-based indexing). Hence, the beauty\nof \n    p\n is \n    2\n. Your task is to find the sum of beauties of all\n\n    n!\n permutations of size \n    n\n. Print the remainder we get when\ndividing this value by \n    1\n     000\n     000\n     007\n (\n    10^9 + 7\n). Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of\ntest cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The description of the test\ncases follows. Each test case has only one line \u2014 the integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print one\ninteger \u2014 the sum of beauties of all permutations of size \n    n\n modulo\n\n    1\n     000\n     000\n     007\n (\n    10^9 + 7\n). Example Input 3 1 2 100 Output\n0 4 389456655 Note For the first test case of the example, \n    p = [1]\n is\nthe only permutation. \n    a = [1, 1]\n has \n    0\n inversions. For the second\ntest case of the example, the permutations are \n    [1, 2]\n and \n    [2, 1]\n.\nTheir respective \n    a\n arrays are \n    [1, 2, 2, 1]\n and \n    [2, 1, 1, 2]\n,\nboth of which have \n    2\n inversions.\n\n",
