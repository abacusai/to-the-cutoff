        "description": "A group of university students wants to get to the top of a mountain to have a\npicnic there. For that they decided to use a cableway. A cableway is\nrepresented by some cablecars, hanged onto some cable stations by a cable. A\ncable is scrolled cyclically between the first and the last cable stations\n(the first of them is located at the bottom of the mountain and the last one\nis located at the top). As the cable moves, the cablecar attached to it move\nas well. The number of cablecars is divisible by three and they are painted\nthree colors: red, green and blue, in such manner that after each red cablecar\ngoes a green one, after each green cablecar goes a blue one and after each\nblue cablecar goes a red one. Each cablecar can transport no more than two\npeople, the cablecars arrive with the periodicity of one minute (i. e. every\nminute) and it takes exactly 30 minutes for a cablecar to get to the top. All\nstudents are divided into three groups: r of them like to ascend only in the\nred cablecars, g of them prefer only the green ones and b of them prefer only\nthe blue ones. A student never gets on a cablecar painted a color that he\ndoesn't like, The first cablecar to arrive (at the moment of time 0) is\npainted red. Determine the least time it will take all students to ascend to\nthe mountain top. Input The first line contains three integers r, g and b (0 \u2264\nr, g, b \u2264 100). It is guaranteed that r + g + b > 0, it means that the group\nconsists of at least one student. Output Print a single number \u2014 the minimal\ntime the students need for the whole group to ascend to the top of the\nmountain. Examples Input 1 3 2 Output 34 Input 3 2 1 Output 33 Note Let's\nanalyze the first sample. At the moment of time 0 a red cablecar comes and one\nstudent from the r group get on it and ascends to the top at the moment of\ntime 30. At the moment of time 1 a green cablecar arrives and two students\nfrom the g group get on it; they get to the top at the moment of time 31. At\nthe moment of time 2 comes the blue cablecar and two students from the b group\nget on it. They ascend to the top at the moment of time 32. At the moment of\ntime 3 a red cablecar arrives but the only student who is left doesn't like\nred and the cablecar leaves empty. At the moment of time 4 a green cablecar\narrives and one student from the g group gets on it. He ascends to top at the\nmoment of time 34. Thus, all the students are on the top, overall the\nascension took exactly 34 minutes.\n\n",
