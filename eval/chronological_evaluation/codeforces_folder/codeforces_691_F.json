        "description": "Couple Cover, a wildly popular luck-based game, is about to begin! Two players\nmust work together to construct a rectangle. A bag with n balls, each with an\ninteger written on it, is placed on the table. The first player reaches in and\ngrabs a ball randomly (all balls have equal probability of being chosen) \u2014 the\nnumber written on this ball is the rectangle's width in meters. This ball is\nnot returned to the bag, and the second player reaches into the bag and grabs\nanother ball \u2014 the number written on this ball is the rectangle's height in\nmeters. If the area of the rectangle is greater than or equal some threshold p\nsquare meters, the players win. Otherwise, they lose. The organizers of the\ngame are trying to select an appropriate value for p so that the probability\nof a couple winning is not too high and not too low, but they are slow at\ncounting, so they have hired you to answer some questions for them. You are\ngiven a list of the numbers written on the balls, the organizers would like to\nknow how many winning pairs of balls exist for different values of p. Note\nthat two pairs are different if either the first or the second ball is\ndifferent between the two in pair, and two different balls with the same\nnumber are considered different. Input The input begins with a single positive\ninteger n in its own line (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6). The second line contains n positive\nintegers \u2014 the i-th number in this line is equal to ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 3\u00b710^6), the\nnumber written on the i-th ball. The next line contains an integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264\n10^6), the number of questions you are being asked. Then, the following line\ncontains m positive integers \u2014 the j-th number in this line is equal to the\nvalue of p (1 \u2264 p \u2264 3\u00b710^6) in the j-th question you are being asked. Output\nFor each question, print the number of winning pairs of balls that exist for\nthe given value of p in the separate line. Examples Input 5 4 2 6 1 3 4 1 3 5\n8 Output 20 18 14 10 Input 2 5 6 2 30 31 Output 2 0\n\n",
