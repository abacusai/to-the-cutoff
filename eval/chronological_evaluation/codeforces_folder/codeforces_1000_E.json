        "description": "Your friend is developing a computer game. He has already decided how the game\nworld should look like \u2014 it should consist of \n    n\n locations connected by\n\n    m\n two-way passages. The passages are designed in such a way that it\nshould be possible to get from any location to any other location. Of course,\nsome passages should be guarded by the monsters (if you just can go everywhere\nwithout any difficulties, then it's not fun, right?). Some crucial passages\nwill be guarded by really fearsome monsters, requiring the hero to prepare for\nbattle and designing his own tactics of defeating them (commonly these kinds\nof monsters are called bosses). And your friend wants you to help him place\nthese bosses. The game will start in location \n    s\n and end in location\n\n    t\n, but these locations are not chosen yet. After choosing these\nlocations, your friend will place a boss in each passage such that it is\nimpossible to get from \n    s\n to \n    t\n without using this passage. Your\nfriend wants to place as much bosses as possible (because more challenges\nmeans more fun, right?), so he asks you to help him determine the maximum\npossible number of bosses, considering that any location can be chosen as\n\n    s\n or as \n    t\n. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    n - 1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 3\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of locations and passages, respectively. Then\n\n    m\n lines follow, each containing two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    x \n     y\n) describing the endpoints of one of the\npassages. It is guaranteed that there is no pair of locations directly\nconnected by two or more passages, and that any location is reachable from any\nother location. Output Print one integer \u2014 the maximum number of bosses your\nfriend can place, considering all possible choices for \n    s\n and \n    t\n.\nExamples Input 5 5 1 2 2 3 3 1 4 1 5 2 Output 2 Input 4 3 1 2 4 3 3 2 Output 3\n\n",
