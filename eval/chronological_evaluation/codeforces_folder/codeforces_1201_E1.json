        "description": "This problem only differs from the next problem in constraints. This is an\ninteractive problem. Alice and Bob are playing a game on the chessboard of\nsize \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n where \n    n\n and \n    m\n are even. The rows are\nnumbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n and the columns are numbered from \n    1\n to\n\n    m\n. There are two knights on the chessboard. A white one initially is on\nthe position \n    (x_1, y_1)\n, while the black one is on the position \n    (x_2,\n    y_2)\n. Alice will choose one of the knights to play with, and Bob will use\nthe other one. The Alice and Bob will play in turns and whoever controls the\nwhite knight starts the game. During a turn, the player must move their knight\nadhering the chess rules. That is, if the knight is currently on the position\n\n    (x, y)\n, it can be moved to any of those positions (as long as they are\ninside the chessboard): \n    (x+1, y+2)\n, \n    (x+1, y-2)\n, \n    (x-1, y+2)\n,\n\n    (x-1, y-2)\n,\n    (x+2, y+1)\n, \n    (x+2, y-1)\n, \n    (x-2, y+1)\n,\n\n    (x-2, y-1)\n. We all know that knights are strongest in the middle of the\nboard. Both knight have a single position they want to reach: the owner of the\nwhite knight wins if it captures the black knight or if the white knight is at\n\n    (n/2, m/2)\n and this position is not under attack of the black knight at\nthis moment; The owner of the black knight wins if it captures the white\nknight or if the black knight is at \n    (n/2+1, m/2)\n and this position is\nnot under attack of the white knight at this moment. Formally, the player who\ncaptures the other knight wins. The player who is at its target square\n(\n    (n/2, m/2)\n for white, \n    (n/2+1, m/2)\n for black) and this position\nis not under opponent's attack, also wins. A position is under attack of a\nknight if it can move into this position. Capturing a knight means that a\nplayer moves their knight to the cell where the opponent's knight is. If Alice\nmade \n    350\n moves and nobody won, the game is a draw. Alice is unsure in\nher chess skills, so she asks you for a help. Choose a knight and win the game\nfor her. It can be shown, that Alice always has a winning strategy.\nInteraction The interaction starts with two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    6\n    \n    \u2264 n,m \n    \u2264 40\n, \n    n\n and \n    m\n are even) \u2014 the dimensions of the\nchessboard. The second line contains four integers \n    x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_1, x_2 \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 y_1, y_2 \n    \u2264 m\n) \u2014 the\npositions of the white and the black knight. It is guaranteed that the two\nknights have different starting positions. It is also guaranteed that none of\nthe knights are in their own target square in the beginning of the game\n(however, they can be on the opponent's target position). Your program should\nreply with either \"WHITE\" or \"BLACK\", depending on the knight you want to play\nwith. In case you select the white knight, you start the game. During every\nyour turn, you need to print two integers: \n    x\n and \n    y\n, the position\nto move the knight. If you won the game by this turn, you must terminate your\nprogram immediately. After every turn of the opponent, you will receive two\nintegers: \n    x\n and \n    y\n, the position where Bob moved his knight. If\nyour last move was illegal or you lost the game after jury's turn, or you made\n\n    350\n moves, and haven't won, you will receive \"-1 -1\". In such cases, you\nshould terminate your program and then you will get a Wrong Answer verdict.\nAfter printing anything, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the\noutput. Otherwise, you might get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:\nfflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; System.out.flush() in Java;\nflush(output) in Pascal; stdout.flush() in Python; see documentation for other\nlanguages.Hacks are disabled for this problem. Jury's program is adaptive: the\nmoves of jury may depend on the moves made by your program. Examples Input 8 8\n2 3 1 8 Output WHITE 4 4 Input 6 6 4 4 2 2 6 3 Output BLACK 4 3 Note In the\nfirst example, the white knight can reach it's target square in one move. In\nthe second example black knight wins, no matter what white knight moves.\n\n",
