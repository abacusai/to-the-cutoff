        "description": "Given a positive integer \n    m\n, we say that a sequence \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026,\n    x_n\n of positive integers is \n    m\n-cute if for every index \n    i\n such\nthat \n    2 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n it holds that \n    x_i = x_i - 1 + x_i - 2 +\n    \n    \u2026 + x_1 + r_i\n for some positive integer \n    r_i\n satisfying \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 m\n. You will be given \n    q\n queries consisting of three\npositive integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n and \n    m\n. For each query you must\ndetermine whether or not there exists an \n    m\n-cute sequence whose first\nterm is \n    a\n and whose last term is \n    b\n. If such a sequence exists, you\nmust additionally find an example of it. Input The first line contains an\ninteger number \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of queries.\nEach of the following \n    q\n lines contains three integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n,\nand \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b, m \n    \u2264 10^14\n, \n    a \n    \u2264 b\n),\ndescribing a single query. Output For each query, if no \n    m\n-cute sequence\nwhose first term is \n    a\n and whose last term is \n    b\n exists, print\n\n    -1\n. Otherwise print an integer \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 50\n),\nfollowed by \n    k\n integers \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^14\n). These integers must satisfy \n    x_1 = a\n, \n    x_k = b\n,\nand that the sequence \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_k\n is \n    m\n-cute. It can be\nshown that under the problem constraints, for each query either no\n\n    m\n-cute sequence exists, or there exists one with at most \n    50\n terms.\nIf there are multiple possible sequences, you may print any of them. Example\nInput 2 5 26 2 3 9 1 Output 4 5 6 13 26 -1 Note Consider the sample. In the\nfirst query, the sequence \n    5, 6, 13, 26\n is valid since \n    6 = 5 +\n    \n    \n     1\n, \n    13 = 6 + 5 + \n    \n     2\n and\n\n    26 = 13 + 6 + 5 + \n    \n     2\n have the bold values all\nbetween \n    1\n and \n    2\n, so the sequence is \n    2\n-cute. Other valid\nsequences, such as \n    5, 7, 13, 26\n are also accepted. In the second query,\nthe only possible \n    1\n-cute sequence starting at \n    3\n is \n    3, 4, 8, 16,\n    \n    \u2026\n, which does not contain \n    9\n.\n\n",
