        "description": "The elections in which three candidates participated have recently ended. The\nfirst candidate received \n    a\n votes, the second one received \n    b\n votes,\nthe third one received \n    c\n votes. For each candidate, solve the following\nproblem: how many votes should be added to this candidate so that he wins the\nelection (i.e. the number of votes for this candidate was strictly greater\nthan the number of votes for any other candidate)? Please note that for each\ncandidate it is necessary to solve this problem independently, i.e. the added\nvotes for any candidate do not affect the calculations when getting the answer\nfor the other two candidates. Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n\ntest cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing three\nintegers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, and \n    c\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a,b,c \n    \u2264 10^9\n).\nOutput For each test case, output in a separate line three integers \n    A\n,\n\n    B\n, and \n    C\n (\n    A, B, C \n    \u2265 0\n) separated by spaces \u2014 the answers\nto the problem for the first, second, and third candidate, respectively.\nExample Input 5 0 0 0 10 75 15 13 13 17 1000 0 0 0 1000000000 0 Output 1 1 1\n66 0 61 5 5 0 0 1001 1001 1000000001 0 1000000001\n\n",
