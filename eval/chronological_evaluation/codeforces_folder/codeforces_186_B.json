        "description": "Each year in the castle of Dwarven King there is a competition in growing\nmushrooms among the dwarves. The competition is one of the most prestigious\nones, and the winner gets a wooden salad bowl. This year's event brought\ntogether the best mushroom growers from around the world, so we had to\nslightly change the rules so that the event gets more interesting to watch.\nEach mushroom grower has a mushroom that he will grow on the competition.\nUnder the new rules, the competition consists of two parts. The first part\nlasts t1 seconds and the second part lasts t2 seconds. The first and the\nsecond part are separated by a little break. After the starting whistle the\nfirst part of the contest starts, and all mushroom growers start growing\nmushrooms at once, each at his individual speed of vi meters per second. After\nt1 seconds, the mushroom growers stop growing mushrooms and go to have a\nbreak. During the break, for unexplained reasons, the growth of all mushrooms\nis reduced by k percent. After the break the second part of the contest starts\nand all mushrooms growers at the same time continue to grow mushrooms, each at\nhis individual speed of ui meters per second. After a t2 seconds after the end\nof the break, the competition ends. Note that the speeds before and after the\nbreak may vary. Before the match dwarf Pasha learned from all participants,\nwhat two speeds they have chosen. However, the participants did not want to\ndisclose to him all their strategy and therefore, did not say in what order\nthey will be using these speeds. That is, if a participant chose speeds ai and\nbi, then there are two strategies: he either uses speed ai before the break\nand speed bi after it, or vice versa. Dwarf Pasha really wants to win the\ntotalizer. He knows that each participant chooses the strategy that maximizes\nthe height of the mushroom. Help Dwarf Pasha make the final table of\ncompetition results. The participants are sorted in the result table by the\nmushroom height (the participants with higher mushrooms follow earlier in the\ntable). In case of equal mushroom heights, the participants are sorted by\ntheir numbers (the participants with a smaller number follow earlier). Input\nThe first input line contains four integer numbers n, t1, t2, k (1 \u2264 n, t1, t2\n\u2264 1000; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of participants, the time before the break,\nthe time after the break and the percentage, by which the mushroom growth\ndrops during the break, correspondingly. Each of the following n lines\ncontains two integers. The i-th (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) line contains space-separated\nintegers ai, bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 1000) \u2014 the speeds which the participant number\ni chose. Output Print the final results' table: n lines, each line should\ncontain the number of the corresponding dwarf and the final maximum height of\nhis mushroom with exactly two digits after the decimal point. The answer will\nbe considered correct if it is absolutely accurate. Examples Input 2 3 3 50 2\n4 4 2 Output 1 15.00 2 15.00 Input 4 1 1 1 544 397 280 101 280 101 693 970\nOutput 4 1656.07 1 937.03 2 379.99 3 379.99 Note First example: for each\ncontestant it is optimal to use firstly speed 2 and afterwards speed 4,\nbecause 2\u00b73\u00b70.5 + 4\u00b73 > 4\u00b73\u00b70.5 + 2\u00b73.\n\n",
