        "description": "You are given an array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n of integers. This array\nis non-increasing. Let's consider a line with \n    n\n shops. The shops are\nnumbered with integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n from left to right. The cost of\na meal in the \n    i\n-th shop is equal to \n    a_i\n. You should process\n\n    q\n queries of two types: 1 x y: for each shop \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 x\n\nset \n    a_i = max(a_i, y)\n. 2 x y: let's consider a hungry man with\n\n    y\n money. He visits the shops from \n    x\n-th shop to \n    n\n-th and if\nhe can buy a meal in the current shop he buys one item of it. Find how many\nmeals he will purchase. The man can buy a meal in the shop \n    i\n if he has\nat least \n    a_i\n money, and after it his money decreases by \n    a_i\n. Input\nThe first line contains two integers \n    n\n, \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, q \n    \u2264\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 the costs of the\nmeals. It is guaranteed, that \n    a_1 \n    \u2265 a_2 \n    \u2265\n    \u2026\n    \u2265 a_n\n.\nEach of the next \n    q\n lines contains three integers \n    t\n, \n    x\n,\n\n    y\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 y\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n), each describing the next query. It is guaranteed that there\nexists at least one query of type \n    2\n. Output For each query of type\n\n    2\n output the answer on the new line. Example Input 10 6 10 10 10 6 6 5 5\n5 3 1 2 3 50 2 4 10 1 3 10 2 2 36 1 4 7 2 2 17 Output 8 3 6 2 Note In the\nfirst query a hungry man will buy meals in all shops from \n    3\n to \n    10\n.\nIn the second query a hungry man will buy meals in shops \n    4\n, \n    9\n, and\n\n    10\n. After the third query the array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n of\ncosts won't change and will be \n    10, 10, 10, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 3,\n    1\n. In the fourth query a hungry man will buy meals in shops \n    2\n,\n\n    3\n, \n    4\n, \n    5\n, \n    9\n, and \n    10\n. After the fifth query the\narray \n    a\n of costs will be \n    10, 10, 10, 7, 6, 5, 5, 5, 3,\n    1\n. In the sixth query a hungry man will buy meals in shops \n    2\n and\n\n    4\n.\n\n",
