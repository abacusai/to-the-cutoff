        "description": "Several ages ago Berland was a kingdom. The King of Berland adored math.\nThat's why, when he first visited one of his many palaces, he first of all\npaid attention to the floor in one hall. The floor was tiled with hexagonal\ntiles. The hall also turned out hexagonal in its shape. The King walked along\nthe perimeter of the hall and concluded that each of the six sides has a, b,\nc, a, b and c adjacent tiles, correspondingly. To better visualize the\nsituation, look at the picture showing a similar hexagon for a = 2, b = 3 and\nc = 4. According to the legend, as the King of Berland obtained the values a,\nb and c, he almost immediately calculated the total number of tiles on the\nhall floor. Can you do the same? Input The first line contains three integers:\na, b and c (2 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 1000). Output Print a single number \u2014 the total\nnumber of tiles on the hall floor. Examples Input 2 3 4 Output 18\n\n",
