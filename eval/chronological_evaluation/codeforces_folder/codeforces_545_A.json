        "description": "Little Susie, thanks to her older brother, likes to play with cars. Today she\ndecided to set up a tournament between them. The process of a tournament is\ndescribed in the next paragraph. There are n toy cars. Each pair collides. The\nresult of a collision can be one of the following: no car turned over, one car\nturned over, both cars turned over. A car is good if it turned over in no\ncollision. The results of the collisions are determined by an n \u00d7 n matrix \u0410:\nthere is a number on the intersection of the \u0456-th row and j-th column that\ndescribes the result of the collision of the \u0456-th and the j-th car: \u00ad 1: if\nthis pair of cars never collided. - 1 occurs only on the main diagonal of the\nmatrix. 0: if no car turned over during the collision. 1: if only the i-th car\nturned over during the collision. 2: if only the j-th car turned over during\nthe collision. 3: if both cars turned over during the collision. Susie wants\nto find all the good cars. She quickly determined which cars are good. Can you\ncope with the task? Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014\nthe number of cars. Each of the next n lines contains n space-separated\nintegers that determine matrix A. It is guaranteed that on the main diagonal\nthere are - 1, and - 1 doesn't appear anywhere else in the matrix. It is\nguaranteed that the input is correct, that is, if Aij = 1, then Aji = 2, if\nAij = 3, then Aji = 3, and if Aij = 0, then Aji = 0. Output Print the number\nof good cars and in the next line print their space-separated indices in the\nincreasing order. Examples Input 3 -1 0 0 0 -1 1 0 2 -1 Output 2 1 3 Input 4\n-1 3 3 3 3 -1 3 3 3 3 -1 3 3 3 3 -1 Output 0\n\n",
