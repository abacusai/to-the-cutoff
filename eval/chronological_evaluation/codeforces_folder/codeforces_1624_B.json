        "description": "Polycarp has \n    3\n positive integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n and \n    c\n. He can\nperform the following operation exactly once. Choose a positive integer\n\n    m\n and multiply exactly one of the integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n or \n    c\n\nby \n    m\n. Can Polycarp make it so that after performing the operation, the\nsequence of three numbers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    c\n (in this order) forms an\narithmetic progression? Note that you cannot change the order of \n    a\n,\n\n    b\n and \n    c\n. Formally, a sequence \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n\n is\ncalled an arithmetic progression (AP) if there exists a number \n    d\n (called\n\"common difference\") such that \n    x_i+1=x_i+d\n for all \n    i\n from\n\n    1\n to \n    n-1\n. In this problem, \n    n=3\n. For example, the following\nsequences are AP: \n    [5, 10, 15]\n, \n    [3, 2, 1]\n, \n    [1, 1, 1]\n, and\n\n    [13, 10, 7]\n. The following sequences are not AP: \n    [1, 2, 4]\n, \n    [0,\n    1, 0]\n and \n    [1, 3, 2]\n. You need to answer \n    t\n independent test\ncases. Input The first line contains the number \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each of the following \n    t\n lines\ncontains \n    3\n integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b, c \n    \u2264\n    10^8\n). Output For each test case print \"YES\" (without quotes) if Polycarp\ncan choose a positive integer \n    m\n and multiply exactly one of the integers\n\n    a\n, \n    b\n or \n    c\n by \n    m\n to make \n    [a, b, c]\n be an\narithmetic progression. Print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print\nYES and NO in any (upper or lower) case (for example, the strings yEs, yes,\nYes and YES will be recognized as a positive answer). Example Input 11 10 5 30\n30 5 10 1 2 3 1 6 3 2 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 100000000 1 2 1 1 1 2 2 Output\nYES YES YES YES NO YES NO YES YES NO YES Note In the first and second test\ncases, you can choose the number \n    m=4\n and multiply the second number\n(\n    b=5\n) by \n    4\n. In the first test case the resulting sequence will be\n\n    [10, 20, 30]\n. This is an AP with a difference \n    d=10\n. In the second\ntest case the resulting sequence will be \n    [30, 20, 10]\n. This is an AP\nwith a difference \n    d=-10\n. In the third test case, you can choose\n\n    m=1\n and multiply any number by \n    1\n. The resulting sequence will be\n\n    [1, 2, 3]\n. This is an AP with a difference \n    d=1\n. In the fourth test\ncase, you can choose \n    m=9\n and multiply the first number (\n    a=1\n) by\n\n    9\n. The resulting sequence will be \n    [9, 6, 3]\n. This is an AP with a\ndifference \n    d=-3\n. In the fifth test case, it is impossible to make an AP.\n\n",
