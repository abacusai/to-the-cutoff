        "description": "A stowaway and a controller play the following game. The train is represented\nby n wagons which are numbered with positive integers from 1 to n from the\nhead to the tail. The stowaway and the controller are initially in some two\ndifferent wagons. Every minute the train can be in one of two conditions \u2014\nmoving or idle. Every minute the players move. The controller's move is as\nfollows. The controller has the movement direction \u2014 to the train's head or to\nits tail. During a move the controller moves to the neighbouring wagon\ncorrespondingly to its movement direction. If at the end of his move the\ncontroller enters the 1-st or the n-th wagon, that he changes the direction of\nhis movement into the other one. In other words, the controller cyclically\ngoes from the train's head to its tail and back again during all the time of a\ngame, shifting during each move by one wagon. Note, that the controller always\nhave exactly one possible move. The stowaway's move depends from the state of\nthe train. If the train is moving, then the stowaway can shift to one of\nneighbouring wagons or he can stay where he is without moving. If the train is\nat a station and is idle, then the stowaway leaves the train (i.e. he is now\nnot present in any train wagon) and then, if it is not the terminal train\nstation, he enters the train again into any of n wagons (not necessarily into\nthe one he's just left and not necessarily into the neighbouring one). If the\ntrain is idle for several minutes then each such minute the stowaway leaves\nthe train and enters it back. Let's determine the order of the players' moves.\nIf at the given minute the train is moving, then first the stowaway moves and\nthen the controller does. If at this minute the train is idle, then first the\nstowaway leaves the train, then the controller moves and then the stowaway\nenters the train. If at some point in time the stowaway and the controller\nhappen to be in one wagon, then the controller wins: he makes the stowaway pay\nfine. If after a while the stowaway reaches the terminal train station, then\nthe stowaway wins: he simply leaves the station during his move and never\nreturns there again. At any moment of time the players know each other's\npositions. The players play in the optimal way. Specifically, if the\ncontroller wins, then the stowaway plays so as to lose as late as possible. As\nall the possible moves for the controller are determined uniquely, then he is\nconsidered to play optimally always. Determine the winner. Input The first\nline contains three integers n, m and k. They represent the number of wagons\nin the train, the stowaway's and the controller's initial positions\ncorrespondingly (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 m, k \u2264 n, m \u2260 k). The second line contains\nthe direction in which a controller moves. \"to head\" means that the controller\nmoves to the train's head and \"to tail\" means that the controller moves to its\ntail. It is guaranteed that in the direction in which the controller is\nmoving, there is at least one wagon. Wagon 1 is the head, and wagon n is the\ntail. The third line has the length from 1 to 200 and consists of symbols \"0\"\nand \"1\". The i-th symbol contains information about the train's state at the\ni-th minute of time. \"0\" means that in this very minute the train moves and\n\"1\" means that the train in this very minute stands idle. The last symbol of\nthe third line is always \"1\" \u2014 that's the terminal train station. Output If\nthe stowaway wins, print \"Stowaway\" without quotes. Otherwise, print\n\"Controller\" again without quotes, then, separated by a space, print the\nnumber of a minute, at which the stowaway will be caught. Examples Input 5 3 2\nto head 0001001 Output Stowaway Input 3 2 1 to tail 0001 Output Controller 2\n\n",
