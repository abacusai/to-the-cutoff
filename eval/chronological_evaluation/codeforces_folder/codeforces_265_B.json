        "description": "Squirrel Liss loves nuts. There are n trees (numbered 1 to n from west to\neast) along a street and there is a delicious nut on the top of each tree. The\nheight of the tree i is hi. Liss wants to eat all nuts. Now Liss is on the\nroot of the tree with the number 1. In one second Liss can perform one of the\nfollowing actions: Walk up or down one unit on a tree. Eat a nut on the top of\nthe current tree. Jump to the next tree. In this action the height of Liss\ndoesn't change. More formally, when Liss is at height h of the tree i (1 \u2264 i \u2264\nn - 1), she jumps to height h of the tree i + 1. This action can't be\nperformed if h > hi + 1. Compute the minimal time (in seconds) required to eat\nall nuts. Input The first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the\nnumber of trees. Next n lines contains the height of trees: i-th line contains\nan integer hi (1 \u2264 hi \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the height of the tree with the number i.\nOutput Print a single integer \u2014 the minimal time required to eat all nuts in\nseconds. Examples Input 2 1 2 Output 5 Input 5 2 1 2 1 1 Output 14\n\n",
