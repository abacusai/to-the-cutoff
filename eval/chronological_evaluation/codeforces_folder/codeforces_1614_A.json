        "description": "Businessman Divan loves chocolate! Today he came to a store to buy some\nchocolate. Like all businessmen, Divan knows the value of money, so he will\nnot buy too expensive chocolate. At the same time, too cheap chocolate tastes\nbad, so he will not buy it as well. The store he came to has \n    n\n different\nchocolate bars, and the price of the \n    i\n-th chocolate bar is \n    a_i\n\ndollars. Divan considers a chocolate bar too expensive if it costs strictly\nmore than \n    r\n dollars. Similarly, he considers a bar of chocolate to be\ntoo cheap if it costs strictly less than \n    l\n dollars. Divan will not buy\ntoo cheap or too expensive bars. Divan is not going to spend all his money on\nchocolate bars, so he will spend at most \n    k\n dollars on chocolates. Please\ndetermine the maximum number of chocolate bars Divan can buy. Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n). Description of the test cases follows.\nThe description of each test case consists of two lines. The first line\ncontains integers \n    n\n, \n    l\n, \n    r\n, \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    100\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the\nlowest acceptable price of a chocolate, the highest acceptable price of a\nchocolate and Divan's total budget, respectively. The second line contains a\nsequence \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) integers\n\u2014 the prices of chocolate bars in the store. Output For each test case print a\nsingle integer \u2014 the maximum number of chocolate bars Divan can buy.

In the second example Divan can buy chocolate bars \n    3\n and \n    4\n\nand spend \n    7\n dollars on them. In the third example Divan can buy\nchocolate bars \n    3\n, \n    4\n, and \n    5\n for \n    12\n dollars. In the\nfourth example Divan cannot buy any chocolate bar because each of them is\neither too cheap or too expensive. In the fifth example Divan cannot buy any\nchocolate bar because he considers the first bar too cheap, and has no budget\nfor the second or third. In the sixth example Divan can buy all the chocolate\nbars in the shop.\n\n",
