        "description": "You are given a sequence of \n    n\n digits \n    d_1d_2 \n    \u2026 d_n\n. You\nneed to paint all the digits in two colors so that: each digit is painted\neither in the color \n    1\n or in the color \n    2\n; if you write in a row\nfrom left to right all the digits painted in the color \n    1\n, and then after\nthem all the digits painted in the color \n    2\n, then the resulting sequence\nof \n    n\n digits will be non-decreasing (that is, each next digit will be\ngreater than or equal to the previous digit). For example, for the sequence\n\n    d=914\n the only valid coloring is \n    211\n (paint in the color \n    1\n\ntwo last digits, paint in the color \n    2\n the first digit). But \n    122\n is\nnot a valid coloring (\n    9\n concatenated with \n    14\n is not a non-\ndecreasing sequence). It is allowed that either of the two colors is not used\nat all. Digits painted in the same color are not required to have consecutive\npositions. Find any of the valid ways to paint the given sequence of digits or\ndetermine that it is impossible to do. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in\nthe input. The first line of each test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b710^5\n) \u2014 the length of a given sequence of digits. The\nnext line contains a sequence of \n    n\n digits \n    d_1d_2 \n    \u2026 d_n\n\n(\n    0 \n    \u2264 d_i \n    \u2264 9\n). The digits are written in a row without spaces or\nany other separators. The sequence can start with 0. It is guaranteed that the\nsum of the values \u200b\u200bof \n    n\n for all test cases in the input does not exceed\n\n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output Print \n    t\n lines \u2014 the answers to each of the\ntest cases in the input. If there is a solution for a test case, the\ncorresponding output line should contain any of the valid colorings written as\na string of \n    n\n digits \n    t_1t_2 \n    \u2026 t_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t_i \n    \u2264\n    2\n), where \n    t_i\n is the color the \n    i\n-th digit is painted in. If\nthere are several feasible solutions, print any of them. If there is no\nsolution, then the corresponding output line should contain a single character\n'-' (the minus sign). Example Input 5 12 040425524644 1 0 9 123456789 2 98 3\n987 Output 121212211211 1 222222222 21 \u00ad Note In the first test case,\n\n    d=040425524644\n. The output \n    t=121212211211\n is correct because\n\n    0022444\n (painted in \n    1\n) concatenated with \n    44556\n (painted in\n\n    2\n) is \n    002244444556\n which is a sorted sequence of \n    n\n given\ndigits.\n\n",
