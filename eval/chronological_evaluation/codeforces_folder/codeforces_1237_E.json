        "description": "Recall that a binary search tree is a rooted binary tree, whose nodes each\nstore a key and each have at most two distinguished subtrees, left and right.\nThe key in each node must be greater than any key stored in the left subtree,\nand less than any key stored in the right subtree. The depth of a vertex is\nthe number of edges on the simple path from the vertex to the root. In\nparticular, the depth of the root is \n    0\n. Let's call a binary search tree\nperfectly balanced if there doesn't exist a binary search tree with the same\nnumber of vertices that has a strictly smaller sum of depths of its vertices.\nLet's call a binary search tree with integer keys striped if both of the\nfollowing conditions are satisfied for every vertex \n    v\n: If \n    v\n has a\nleft subtree whose root is \n    u\n, then the parity of the key of \n    v\n is\ndifferent from the parity of the key of \n    u\n. If \n    v\n has a right\nsubtree whose root is \n    w\n, then the parity of the key of \n    v\n is the\nsame as the parity of the key of \n    w\n. You are given a single integer\n\n    n\n. Find the number of perfectly balanced striped binary search trees\nwith \n    n\n vertices that have distinct integer keys between \n    1\n and\n\n    n\n, inclusive. Output this number modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Input\nThe only line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n),\ndenoting the required number of vertices. Output Output the number of\nperfectly balanced striped binary search trees with \n    n\n vertices and\ndistinct integer keys between \n    1\n and \n    n\n, inclusive, modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Examples Input 4 Output 1 Input 3 Output 0 Note In\nthe first example, this is the only tree that satisfies the conditions: In the\nsecond example, here are various trees that don't satisfy some condition:\n\n",
