        "name": "Anton and Permutation",
        "description": "Anton likes permutations, especially he likes to permute their elements. Note\nthat a permutation of n elements is a sequence of numbers a1, a2, ..., an,\nin which every number from 1 to n appears exactly once. One day Anton got a\nnew permutation and started to play with it. He does the following operation q\ntimes: he takes two elements of the permutation and swaps these elements.\nAfter each operation he asks his friend Vanya, how many inversions there are\nin the new permutation. The number of inversions in a permutation is the\nnumber of distinct pairs (i, j) such that 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n and ai > aj. Vanya is\ntired of answering Anton's silly questions. So he asked you to write a program\nthat would answer these questions instead of him. Initially Anton's\npermutation was 1, 2, ..., n, that is ai = i for all i such that 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nInput The first line of the input contains two integers n and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200\n000, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 50 000) \u2014 the length of the permutation and the number of\noperations that Anton does. Each of the following q lines of the input\ncontains two integers li and ri (1 \u2264 li, ri \u2264 n) \u2014 the indices of elements\nthat Anton swaps during the i-th operation. Note that indices of elements that\nAnton swaps during the i-th operation can coincide. Elements in the\npermutation are numbered starting with one. Output Output q lines. The i-th\nline of the output is the number of inversions in the Anton's permutation\nafter the i-th operation. Examples Input 5 4 4 5 2 4 2 5 2 2 Output 1 4 3 3\nInput 2 1 2 1 Output 1 Input 6 7 1 4 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 6 2 1 5 1 Output 5 6 7 7 10\n11 8 Note Consider the first sample. After the first Anton's operation the\npermutation will be 1, 2, 3, 5, 4. There is only one inversion in it: (4,\n5). After the second Anton's operation the permutation will be 1, 5, 3, 2,\n4. There are four inversions: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5) and (3, 4). After the\nthird Anton's operation the permutation will be 1, 4, 3, 2, 5. There are\nthree inversions: (2, 3), (2, 4) and (3, 4). After the fourth Anton's\noperation the permutation doesn't change, so there are still three inversions.\n\n",
