        "description": "The year of 2012 is coming... According to an ancient choradrican legend in\nthis very year, in 2012, Diablo and his brothers Mephisto and Baal will escape\nfrom hell, and innumerable hordes of demons will enslave the human world. But\nseven brave heroes have already gathered on the top of a mountain Arreat to\nprotect us mere mortals from the effect of this terrible evil. The seven great\nheroes are: amazon Anka, barbarian Chapay, sorceress Cleo, druid Troll,\nnecromancer Dracul, paladin Snowy and a professional hit girl Hexadecimal.\nHeroes already know how much experience will be given for each of the three\nmegabosses: a for Mephisto, b for Diablo and c for Baal. Here's the problem:\nheroes are as much as seven and megabosses are only three! Then our heroes\ndecided to split into three teams, where each team will go to destroy their\nown megaboss. Each team member will receive a of experience, rounded down,\nwhere x will be the amount of experience for the killed megaboss and y \u2014 the\nnumber of people in the team. Heroes do not want to hurt each other's\nfeelings, so they want to split into teams so that the difference between the\nhero who received the maximum number of experience and the hero who received\nthe minimum number of experience were minimal. Since there can be several\ndivisions into teams, then you need to find the one in which the total amount\nof liking in teams were maximum. It is known that some heroes like others. But\nif hero p likes hero q, this does not mean that the hero q likes hero p. No\nhero likes himself. The total amount of liking in teams is the amount of\nordered pairs (p, q), such that heroes p and q are in the same group, and hero\np likes hero q (but it is not important if hero q likes hero p). In case of\nheroes p and q likes each other and they are in the same group, this pair\nshould be counted twice, as (p, q) and (q, p). A team can consist even of a\nsingle hero, but it is important that every megaboss was destroyed. All heroes\nmust be involved in the campaign against evil. None of the heroes can be in\nmore than one team. It is guaranteed that every hero is able to destroy any\nmegaboss alone. Input The first line contains a single non-negative integer n\n(0 \u2264 n \u2264 42) \u2014 amount of liking between the heroes. Next n lines describe\nliking in the form \"p likes q\", meaning that the hero p likes the hero q (p \u2260\nq). Every liking is described in the input exactly once, no hero likes\nhimself. In the last line are given three integers a, b and c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264\n2\u00b710^9), separated by spaces: the experience for Mephisto, the experience for\nDiablo and experience for Baal. In all the pretests, except for examples from\nthe statement, the following condition is satisfied: a = b = c. Output Print\ntwo integers \u2014 the minimal difference in the experience between two heroes who\nwill receive the maximum and minimum number of experience points, and the\nmaximal total amount of liking in teams (the number of friendships between\nheroes that end up in one team). When calculating the second answer, the team\ndivision should satisfy the difference-minimizing contraint. I.e. primary you\nshould minimize the difference in the experience and secondary you should\nmaximize the total amount of liking. Examples Input 3 Troll likes Dracul\nDracul likes Anka Snowy likes Hexadecimal 210 200 180 Output 30 3 Input 2 Anka\nlikes Chapay Chapay likes Anka 10000 50 50 Output 1950 2 Note A note to first\nexample: it the first team should be Dracul, Troll and Anka, in the second one\nHexadecimal and Snowy, and in the third Cleo \u0438 Chapay.\n\n",
