        "description": "Bethany would like to tile her bathroom. The bathroom has width \n    w\n\ncentimeters and length \n    l\n centimeters. If Bethany simply used the basic\ntiles of size \n    1 \n    \u00d7 1\n centimeters, she would use \n    w \n    \u00b7 l\n\nof them. However, she has something different in mind. On the interior of the\nfloor she wants to use the \n    1 \n    \u00d7 1\n tiles. She needs exactly\n\n    (w-2) \n    \u00b7 (l-2)\n of these. On the floor boundary she wants to use\ntiles of size \n    1 \n    \u00d7 a\n for some positive integer \n    a\n. The tiles\ncan also be rotated by \n    90\n degrees. For which values of \n    a\n can\nBethany tile the bathroom floor as described? Note that \n    a\n can also be\n\n    1\n. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains\nan integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescriptions of the \n    t\n test cases follow. Each test case consist of a\nsingle line, which contains two integers \n    w\n, \n    l\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 w, l\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the dimensions of the bathroom. Output For each test case,\nprint an integer \n    k\n (\n    0\n    \u2264 k\n) \u2014 the number of valid values of\n\n    a\n for the given test case \u2014 followed by \n    k\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2,\n    \u2026, a_k\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 a_i\n) \u2014 the valid values of \n    a\n. The\nvalues \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_k\n have to be sorted from smallest to\nlargest. It is guaranteed that under the problem constraints, the output\ncontains at most \n    200\n     000\n integers. Example Input 3 3 5 12 12\n314159265 358979323 Output 3 1 2 3 3 1 2 11 2 1 2 Note In the first test case,\nthe bathroom is \n    3\n centimeters wide and \n    5\n centimeters long. There\nare three values of \n    a\n such that Bethany can tile the floor as described\nin the statement, namely \n    a=1\n, \n    a=2\n and \n    a=3\n. The three tilings\nare represented in the following pictures.\n\n",
