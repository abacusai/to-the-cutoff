        "name": "Phillip and Trains",
        "description": "The mobile application store has a new game called \"Subway Roller\". The\nprotagonist of the game Philip is located in one end of the tunnel and wants\nto get out of the other one. The tunnel is a rectangular field consisting of\nthree rows and n columns. At the beginning of the game the hero is in some\ncell of the leftmost column. Some number of trains rides towards the hero.\nEach train consists of two or more neighbouring cells in some row of the\nfield. All trains are moving from right to left at a speed of two cells per\nsecond, and the hero runs from left to right at the speed of one cell per\nsecond. For simplicity, the game is implemented so that the hero and the\ntrains move in turns. First, the hero moves one cell to the right, then one\nsquare up or down, or stays idle. Then all the trains move twice\nsimultaneously one cell to the left. Thus, in one move, Philip definitely\nmakes a move to the right and can move up or down. If at any point, Philip is\nin the same cell with a train, he loses. If the train reaches the left column,\nit continues to move as before, leaving the tunnel. Your task is to answer the\nquestion whether there is a sequence of movements of Philip, such that he\nwould be able to get to the rightmost column. Input Each test contains from\none to ten sets of the input data. The first line of the test contains a\nsingle integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10 for pretests and tests or t = 1 for hacks; see\nthe Notes section for details) \u2014 the number of sets. Then follows the\ndescription of t sets of the input data. The first line of the description of\neach set contains two integers n, k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 26) \u2014 the number of\ncolumns on the field and the number of trains. Each of the following three\nlines contains the sequence of n character, representing the row of the field\nwhere the game is on. Philip's initial position is marked as 's', he is in the\nleftmost column. Each of the k trains is marked by some sequence of identical\nuppercase letters of the English alphabet, located in one line. Distinct\ntrains are represented by distinct letters. Character '.' represents an empty\ncell, that is, the cell that doesn't contain either Philip or the trains.\nOutput For each set of the input data print on a single line word YES, if it\nis possible to win the game and word NO otherwise. Examples Input 2 16 4\n...AAAAA........ s.BBB......CCCCC ........DDDDD... 16 4 ...AAAAA........\ns.BBB....CCCCC.. .......DDDDD.... Output YES NO Input 2 10 4 s.ZZ......\n.....AAABB .YYYYYY... 10 4 s.ZZ...... ....AAAABB .YYYYYY... Output YES NO Note\nIn the first set of the input of the first sample Philip must first go forward\nand go down to the third row of the field, then go only forward, then go\nforward and climb to the second row, go forward again and go up to the first\nrow. After that way no train blocks Philip's path, so he can go straight to\nthe end of the tunnel. Note that in this problem the challenges are restricted\nto tests that contain only one testset.\n\n",
