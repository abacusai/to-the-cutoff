        "description": "A company of \n    n\n people is planning a visit to the cinema. Every person\ncan either go to the cinema or not. That depends on how many other people will\ngo. Specifically, every person \n    i\n said: \"I want to go to the cinema if\nand only if at least \n    a_i\n other people will go, not counting myself\".\nThat means that person \n    i\n will become sad if: they go to the cinema, and\nstrictly less than \n    a_i\n other people go; or they don't go to the cinema,\nand at least \n    a_i\n other people go. In how many ways can a set of people\ngoing to the cinema be chosen so that nobody becomes sad? Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). The description of the test cases\nfollows. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\npeople in the company. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n - 1\n) \u2014 integers from peoples'\nclaims. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not\nexceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print a single integer\n\u2014 the number of different ways to choose a set of people going to the cinema\nso that nobody becomes sad. Example Input 4 2 1 1 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 6 0 3 3 6\n7 2 7 5 3 0 0 3 3 Output 2 1 3 2 Note In the first test case, both people want\nto go to the cinema if and only if the other person goes. There are two valid\noptions: either both people go, or neither of them goes. However, if just one\nof them goes, both will be sad. In the second test case, everyone has to go to\nthe cinema. In any other case, someone will be sad. In the third test case,\nthere are three valid options: person number \n    2\n goes to the cinema; or\npersons with indices \n    2, 3, 4, 7\n go; or all eight people go.\n\n",
