        "description": "Stepan is a very experienced olympiad participant. He has n cups for Physics\nolympiads and m cups for Informatics olympiads. Each cup is characterized by\ntwo parameters \u2014 its significance ci and width wi. Stepan decided to expose\nsome of his cups on a shelf with width d in such a way, that: there is at\nleast one Physics cup and at least one Informatics cup on the shelf, the total\nwidth of the exposed cups does not exceed d, from each subjects (Physics and\nInformatics) some of the most significant cups are exposed (i. e. if a cup for\nsome subject with significance x is exposed, then all the cups for this\nsubject with significance greater than x must be exposed too). Your task is to\ndetermine the maximum possible total significance, which Stepan can get when\nhe exposes cups on the shelf with width d, considering all the rules described\nabove. The total significance is the sum of significances of all the exposed\ncups. Input The first line contains three integers n, m and d (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100\n000, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of cups for Physics olympiads, the number of\ncups for Informatics olympiads and the width of the shelf. Each of the\nfollowing n lines contains two integers ci and wi (1 \u2264 ci, wi \u2264 10^9) \u2014\nsignificance and width of the i-th cup for Physics olympiads. Each of the\nfollowing m lines contains two integers cj and wj (1 \u2264 cj, wj \u2264 10^9) \u2014\nsignificance and width of the j-th cup for Informatics olympiads. Output Print\nthe maximum possible total significance, which Stepan can get exposing cups on\nthe shelf with width d, considering all the rules described in the statement.\nIf there is no way to expose cups on the shelf, then print 0. Examples Input 3\n1 8 4 2 5 5 4 2 3 2 Output 8 Input 4 3 12 3 4 2 4 3 5 3 4 3 5 5 2 3 4 Output\n11 Input 2 2 2 5 3 6 3 4 2 8 1 Output 0 Note In the first example Stepan has\nonly one Informatics cup which must be exposed on the shelf. Its significance\nequals 3 and width equals 2, so after Stepan exposes it, the width of free\nspace on the shelf becomes equal to 6. Also, Stepan must expose the second\nPhysics cup (which has width 5), because it is the most significant cup for\nPhysics (its significance equals 5). After that Stepan can not expose more\ncups on the shelf, because there is no enough free space. Thus, the maximum\ntotal significance of exposed cups equals to 8.\n\n",
