        "description": "Marcos loves strings a lot, so he has a favorite string \n    s\n consisting of\nlowercase English letters. For this string, he wrote down all its non-empty\nprefixes and suffixes (except for \n    s\n) on a piece of paper in arbitrary\norder. You see all these strings and wonder if Marcos' favorite string is a\npalindrome or not. So, your task is to decide whether \n    s\n is a palindrome\nby just looking at the piece of paper. A string \n    a\n is a prefix of a\nstring \n    b\n if \n    a\n can be obtained from \n    b\n by deletion of several\n(possibly, zero or all) characters from the end. A string \n    a\n is a suffix\nof a string \n    b\n if \n    a\n can be obtained from \n    b\n by deletion of\nseveral (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning. A palindrome is\na string that reads the same backward as forward, for example, strings \"gg\",\n\"ioi\", \"abba\", \"icpci\" are palindromes, but strings \"codeforces\", \"abcd\",\n\"alt\" are not. Input Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 120\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test\ncase contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 20\n) \u2014 the length\nof the string \n    s\n. The second line of each test case contains \n    2n-2\n\nstrings \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u22ef, a_2n-2\n \u2014 all non-empty prefixes and\nsuffixes of \n    s\n, not including itself, in arbitrary order. It is\nguaranteed that these strings are all the non-empty prefixes and suffixes of\nsome string consisting of lowercase English letters. Output For each test\ncase, output \"YES\" if \n    s\n is a palindrome, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can\noutput the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings\n\"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.\nExample Input 5 4 bcd cd a d abc ab 3 i io i oi 2 g g 3 t al lt a 4 bba a ab a\nabb ba Output NO YES YES NO YES Note In the first test case, \n    s\n is\n\"abcd\". Its prefixes are \"a\", \"ab\" and \"abc\", and its suffixes are \"d\", \"cd\"\nand \"bcd\". As the string \"abcd\" is not a palindrome, the answer is NO. In the\nsecond test case, \n    s\n is \"ioi\". Its prefixes are \"i\" and \"io\", and its\nsuffixes are \"i\" and \"oi\". As the string \"ioi\" is a palindrome, the answer is\nYES. In the third test case, \n    s\n is \"gg\" which is a palindrome. In the\nfourth test case, \n    s\n is \"alt\" which is not a palindrome.\n\n",
