        "description": "Polycarp is reading a book consisting of \n    n\n pages numbered from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n. Every time he finishes the page with the number divisible by\n\n    m\n, he writes down the last digit of this page number. For example, if\n\n    n=15\n and \n    m=5\n, pages divisible by \n    m\n are \n    5, 10, 15\n.\nTheir last digits are \n    5, 0, 5\n correspondingly, their sum is \n    10\n.\nYour task is to calculate the sum of all digits Polycarp has written down. You\nhave to answer \n    q\n independent queries. Input The first line of the input\ncontains one integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of\nqueries. The following \n    q\n lines contain queries, one per line. Each query\nis given as two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264\n    10^16\n) \u2014 the number of pages in the book and required divisor,\nrespectively. Output For each query print the answer for it \u2014 the sum of\ndigits written down by Polycarp.
