        "description": "Scientists of planet Olympia are conducting an experiment in mutation of\nprimitive organisms. Genome of organism from this planet can be represented as\na string of the first K capital English letters. For each pair of types of\ngenes they assigned ai, j \u2014 a risk of disease occurence in the organism\nprovided that genes of these types are adjacent in the genome, where i \u2014 the\n1-based index of the first gene and j \u2014 the index of the second gene. The gene\n'A' has index 1, 'B' has index 2 and so on. For example, a3, 2 stands for the\nrisk of 'CB' fragment. Risk of disease occurence in the organism is equal to\nthe sum of risks for each pair of adjacent genes in the genome. Scientists\nhave already obtained a base organism. Some new organisms can be obtained by\nmutation of this organism. Mutation involves removal of all genes of some\nparticular types. Such removal increases the total risk of disease occurence\nadditionally. For each type of genes scientists determined ti \u2014 the\nincreasement of the total risk of disease occurence provided by removal of all\ngenes having type with index i. For example, t4 stands for the value of\nadditional total risk increasement in case of removing all the 'D' genes.\nScientists want to find a number of different organisms that can be obtained\nfrom the given one which have the total risk of disease occurence not greater\nthan T. They can use only the process of mutation described above. Two\norganisms are considered different if strings representing their genomes are\ndifferent. Genome should contain at least one gene. Input The first line of\nthe input contains three integer numbers N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 200 000) \u2014 length of the\ngenome of base organism, K (1 \u2264 K \u2264 22) \u2014 the maximal index of gene type in\nthe genome and T (1 \u2264 T \u2264 2\u00b710^9) \u2014 maximal allowable risk of disease\noccurence. The second line contains the genome of the given organism. It is a\nstring of the first K capital English letters having length N. The third line\ncontains K numbers t1, t2, ..., tK, where ti is additional risk value of\ndisease occurence provided by removing of all genes of the i-th type. The\nfollowing K lines contain the elements of the given matrix ai, j. The i-th\nline contains K numbers. The j-th number of the i-th line stands for a risk of\ndisease occurence for the pair of genes, first of which corresponds to the\ni-th letter and second of which corresponds to the j-th letter. The given\nmatrix is not necessarily symmetrical. All the numbers in the input are\ninteger, non-negative and all of them except T are not greater than 10^9. It\nis guaranteed that the maximal possible risk of organism that can be obtained\nfrom the given organism is strictly smaller than 2^31. Output Output the\nnumber of organisms that can be obtained from the base one and which have the\ntotal risk of disease occurence not greater than T. Examples Input 5 3 13\nBACAC 4 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 4 3 4 10 Output 5 Note Explanation: one can obtain the\nfollowing organisms (risks are stated in brackets): BACAC (11), ACAC (10), BAA\n(5), B (6), AA (4).\n\n",
