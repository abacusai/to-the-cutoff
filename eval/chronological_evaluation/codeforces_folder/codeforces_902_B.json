        "name": "Coloring a Tree",
        "description": "You are given a rooted tree with n vertices. The vertices are numbered from 1\nto n, the root is the vertex number 1. Each vertex has a color, let's denote\nthe color of vertex v by cv. Initially cv = 0. You have to color the tree into\nthe given colors using the smallest possible number of steps. On each step you\ncan choose a vertex v and a color x, and then color all vectices in the\nsubtree of v (including v itself) in color x. In other words, for every vertex\nu, such that the path from root to u passes through v, set cu = x. It is\nguaranteed that you have to color each vertex in a color different from 0. You\ncan learn what a rooted tree is using the link:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory). Input The first line\ncontains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of vertices in the\ntree. The second line contains n - 1 integers p2, p3, ..., pn (1 \u2264 pi < i),\nwhere pi means that there is an edge between vertices i and pi. The third line\ncontains n integers c1, c2, ..., cn (1 \u2264 ci \u2264 n), where ci is the color you\nshould color the i-th vertex into. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a\ntree. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of steps you have to\nperform to color the tree into given colors. Examples Input 6 1 2 2 1 5 2 1 1\n1 1 1 Output 3 Input 7 1 1 2 3 1 4 3 3 1 1 1 2 3 Output 5 Note The tree from\nthe first sample is shown on the picture (numbers are vetices' indices): On\nfirst step we color all vertices in the subtree of vertex 1 into color 2\n(numbers are colors): On seond step we color all vertices in the subtree of\nvertex 5 into color 1: On third step we color all vertices in the subtree of\nvertex 2 into color 1: The tree from the second sample is shown on the picture\n(numbers are vetices' indices): On first step we color all vertices in the\nsubtree of vertex 1 into color 3 (numbers are colors): On second step we color\nall vertices in the subtree of vertex 3 into color 1: On third step we color\nall vertices in the subtree of vertex 6 into color 2: On fourth step we color\nall vertices in the subtree of vertex 4 into color 1: On fith step we color\nall vertices in the subtree of vertex 7 into color 3:\n\n",
