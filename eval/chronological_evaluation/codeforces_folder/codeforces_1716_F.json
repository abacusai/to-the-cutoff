        "description": "There are \n    n\n bags, each bag contains \n    m\n balls with numbers from\n\n    1\n to \n    m\n. For every \n    i \n    \u2208 [1, m]\n, there is exactly one ball\nwith number \n    i\n in each bag. You have to take exactly one ball from each\nbag (all bags are different, so, for example, taking the ball \n    1\n from the\nfirst bag and the ball \n    2\n from the second bag is not the same as taking\nthe ball \n    2\n from the first bag and the ball \n    1\n from the second bag).\nAfter that, you calculate the number of balls with odd numbers among the ones\nyou have taken. Let the number of these balls be \n    F\n. Your task is to\ncalculate the sum of \n    F^k\n over all possible ways to take \n    n\n balls,\none from each bag. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of\none line containing three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n,\n    m \n    \u2264 998244352\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 2000\n). Output For each test case,\nprint one integer \u2014 the sum of \n    F^k\n over all possible ways to take\n\n    n\n balls, one from each bag. Since it can be huge, print it modulo\n\n    998244353\n. Example Input 5 2 3 8 1 1 1 1 5 10 3 7 2000 1337666 42424242\n2000 Output 1028 1 3 729229716 652219904\n\n",
