        "description": "Nezzar designs a brand new game \"Hidden Permutations\" and shares it with his\nbest friend, Nanako. At the beginning of the game, Nanako and Nezzar both know\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    m\n. The game goes in the following way: Firstly,\nNezzar hides two permutations \n    p_1,p_2,\n    \u2026,p_n\n and\n\n    q_1,q_2,\n    \u2026,q_n\n of integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, and Nanako\nsecretly selects \n    m\n unordered pairs\n\n    (l_1,r_1),(l_2,r_2),\n    \u2026,(l_m,r_m)\n; After that, Nanako sends his\nchosen pairs to Nezzar; On receiving those \n    m\n unordered pairs, Nezzar\nchecks if there exists \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 m\n, such that\n\n    (p_l_i-p_r_i)\n and \n    (q_l_i-q_r_i)\n have different signs. If\nso, Nezzar instantly loses the game and gets a score of \n    -1\n. Otherwise,\nthe score Nezzar gets is equal to the number of indices \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    n\n such that \n    p_i \n    \u2260 q_i\n. However, Nezzar accidentally knows\nNanako's unordered pairs and decides to take advantage of them. Please help\nNezzar find out two permutations \n    p\n and \n    q\n such that the score is\nmaximized. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    t \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each\ntest case contains two integers \n    n,m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5,\n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264\n    min(\n    n(n-1)/2,5 \n    \u00b7 10^5)\n). Then \n    m\n\nlines follow, \n    i\n-th of them contains two integers \n    l_i,r_i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 l_i,r_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    l_i \n    \u2260 r_i\n), describing the \n    i\n-th\nunordered pair Nanako chooses. It is guaranteed that all \n    m\n unordered\npairs are distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n for all test\ncases does not exceed \n    5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, and the sum of \n    m\n for all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    5\n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case,\nprint two permutations \n    p_1,p_2,\n    \u2026,p_n\n and\n\n    q_1,q_2,\n    \u2026,q_n\n such that the score Nezzar gets is maximized.\nExample Input 3 4 2 1 2 3 4 6 4 1 2 1 3 3 5 3 6 2 1 1 2 Output 1 2 3 4 3 4 1 2\n2 3 4 1 6 5 1 4 3 2 5 6 1 2 1 2 Note For first test case, for each pair given\nby Nanako: for the first pair \n    (1,2)\n: \n    p_1 - p_2 = 1 - 2 = -1\n,\n\n    q_1 - q_2 = 3 - 4 = -1\n, they have the same sign; for the second pair\n\n    (3,4)\n: \n    p_3 - p_4 = 3 - 4 = -1\n, \n    q_3 - q_4 = 1 - 2 = -1\n, they\nhave the same sign. As Nezzar does not lose instantly, Nezzar gains the score\nof \n    4\n as \n    p_i \n    \u2260 q_i\n for all \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 4\n.\nObviously, it is the maximum possible score Nezzar can get.\n\n",
