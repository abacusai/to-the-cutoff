        "description": "A mad scientist Dr.Jubal has made a competitive programming task. Try to solve\nit! You are given integers \n    n,k\n. Construct a grid \n    A\n with size \n    n\n    \n    \u00d7 n\n consisting of integers \n    0\n and \n    1\n. The very important\ncondition should be satisfied: the sum of all elements in the grid is exactly\n\n    k\n. In other words, the number of \n    1\n in the grid is equal to\n\n    k\n. Let's define: \n    A_i,j\n as the integer in the \n    i\n-th row and\nthe \n    j\n-th column. \n    R_i = A_i,1+A_i,2+...+A_i,n\n (for all \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n). \n    C_j = A_1,j+A_2,j+...+A_n,j\n (for all \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 j \n    \u2264 n\n). In other words, \n    R_i\n are row sums and \n    C_j\n are\ncolumn sums of the grid \n    A\n. For the grid \n    A\n let's define the value\n\n    f(A) = (\n    max(R)-\n    min(R))^2 + (\n    max(C)-\n    min(C))^2\n (here for an\ninteger sequence \n    X\n we define \n    max(X)\n as the maximum value in\n\n    X\n and \n    min(X)\n as the minimum value in \n    X\n). Find any grid\n\n    A\n, which satisfies the following condition. Among such grids find any,\nfor which the value \n    f(A)\n is the minimum possible. Among such tables, you\ncan find any. Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. Next \n    t\n lines contain descriptions of test cases. For each\ntest case the only line contains two integers \n    n\n, \n    k\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 300, 0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n^2)\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n^2\n\nfor all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case,\nfirstly print the minimum possible value of \n    f(A)\n among all tables, for\nwhich the condition is satisfied. After that, print \n    n\n lines contain\n\n    n\n characters each. The \n    j\n-th character in the \n    i\n-th line\nshould be equal to \n    A_i,j\n. If there are multiple answers you can print\nany. Example Input 4 2 2 3 8 1 0 4 16 Output 0 10 01 2 111 111 101 0 0 0 1111\n1111 1111 1111 Note In the first test case, the sum of all elements in the\ngrid is equal to \n    2\n, so the condition is satisfied. \n    R_1 = 1, R_2 =\n    1\n and \n    C_1 = 1, C_2 = 1\n. Then, \n    f(A) = (1-1)^2 + (1-1)^2 = 0\n,\nwhich is the minimum possible value of \n    f(A)\n. In the second test case,\nthe sum of all elements in the grid is equal to \n    8\n, so the condition is\nsatisfied. \n    R_1 = 3, R_2 = 3, R_3 = 2\n and \n    C_1 = 3, C_2 = 2, C_3 =\n    3\n. Then, \n    f(A) = (3-2)^2 + (3-2)^2 = 2\n. It can be proven, that it is\nthe minimum possible value of \n    f(A)\n.\n\n",
