        "description": "The New Year celebrations in Berland last n days. Only this year the winter is\nsnowless, that\u2019s why the winter celebrations\u2019 organizers should buy artificial\nsnow. There are m snow selling companies in Berland. Every day the i-th\ncompany produces wi cubic meters of snow. Next day the snow thaws and the\ncompany has to produce wi cubic meters of snow again. During the celebration\nnew year discounts are on, that\u2019s why the snow cost decreases every day. It is\nknown that on the first day the total cost of all the snow produced by the\ni-th company is equal to ci bourles. Every day this total cost decreases by ai\nbourles, i.e. on the second day it is equal to ci - ai,and on the third day \u2014\nto ci - 2ai, and so on. It is known that for one company the cost of the snow\nproduced by it does not get negative or equal to zero. You have to organize\nthe snow purchase so as to buy every day exactly W snow cubic meters. At that\nit is not necessary to buy from any company all the snow produced by it. If\nyou buy ni cubic meters of snow (0 \u2264 ni \u2264 wi, the number ni is not necessarily\ninteger!) from the i-th company at one of the days when the cost of its snow\nis equal to si, then its price will total to bourles. During one day one can\nbuy the snow from several companies. In different days one can buy the snow\nfrom different companies. It is required to make the purchases so as to spend\nas little money as possible. It is guaranteed that the snow produced by the\ncompanies will be enough. Input The first line contains integers n, m and W (1\n\u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 500000, 1 \u2264 W \u2264 10^9) which represent the number of days,\nthe number of companies and the amount of snow that needs to be purchased on\nevery one of the n days. The second line contains m integers wi. The third\nline contains m integers ci. The fourth line contains m integers ai. All the\nnumbers are strictly positive and do not exceed 10^9. For all the i the\ninequation ci - (n - 1)ai > 0 holds true. Output Print a single number \u2014 the\nanswer to the given problem. Print the answer in the format with the decimal\npoint (even if the answer is integer, it must contain the decimal point),\nwithout \"e\" and without leading zeroes. The answer should differ with the\nright one by no more than 10^-9.
