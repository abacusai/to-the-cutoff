        "description": "You are given an integer \n    n\n. Find a sequence of \n    n\n distinct integers\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n for all\n\n    i\n and \n    \n\n    max(a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n) - \n    min(a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n)= \n    \u221a(a_1 + a_2 + \n    \u2026 + a_n).\n\n    \n It can be proven that there\nexists a sequence of distinct integers that satisfies all the conditions\nabove. Input The first line of input contains \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of the sequence you have to find. The sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases does not exceed \n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, output\n\n    n\n space-separated distinct integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n\nsatisfying the conditions in the statement. If there are several possible\nanswers, you can output any of them. Please remember that your integers must\nbe distinct! Example Input 3 2 5 4 Output 3 1 20 29 18 26 28 25 21 23 31 Note\nIn the first test case, the maximum is \n    3\n, the minimum is \n    1\n, the\nsum is \n    4\n, and \n    3 - 1 = \n    \u221a(4)\n. In the second test case, the\nmaximum is \n    29\n, the minimum is \n    18\n, the sum is \n    121\n, and\n\n    29-18 = \n    \u221a(121)\n. For each test case, the integers are all distinct.\n\n",
