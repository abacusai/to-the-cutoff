        "description": "You want to type the string \n    s\n, consisting of \n    n\n lowercase Latin\nletters, using your favorite text editor Notepad#. Notepad# supports two kinds\nof operations: append any letter to the end of the string; copy a continuous\nsubstring of an already typed string and paste this substring to the end of\nthe string. Can you type string \n    s\n in strictly less than \n    n\n\noperations? Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of the string \n    s\n. The second line contains a string \n    s\n,\nconsisting of \n    n\n lowercase Latin letters. The sum of \n    n\n doesn't\nexceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n over all testcases. Output For each testcase,\nprint \"YES\" if you can type string \n    s\n in strictly less than \n    n\n\noperations. Otherwise, print \"NO\". Example Input 6 10 codeforces 8 labacaba 5\nuohhh 16 isthissuffixtree 1 x 4 momo Output NO YES NO YES NO YES Note In the\nfirst testcase, you can start with typing \"codef\" (\n    5\n operations), then\ncopy \"o\" (\n    1\n operation) from an already typed part, then finish with\ntyping \"rces\" (\n    4\n operations). That will be \n    10\n operations, which is\nnot strictly less than \n    n\n. There exist other ways to type \"codeforces\".\nHowever, no matter what you do, you can't do less than \n    n\n operations. In\nthe second testcase, you can type \"labac\" (\n    5\n operations), then copy\n\"aba\" (\n    1\n operation), finishing the string in \n    6\n operations.\n\n",
