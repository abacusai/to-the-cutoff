        "description": "In this problem, we will be working with rooted binary trees. A tree is called\na rooted binary tree if it has a fixed root and every vertex has at most two\nchildren. Let's assign a color \u2014 white or blue \u2014 to each vertex of the tree,\nand call this assignment a coloring of the tree. Let's call a coloring diverse\nif every vertex has a neighbor (a parent or a child) colored into an opposite\ncolor compared to this vertex. It can be shown that any tree with at least two\nvertices allows a diverse coloring. Let's define the disbalance of a coloring\nas the absolute value of the difference between the number of white vertices\nand the number of blue vertices. Now to the problem. Initially, the tree\nconsists of a single vertex with the number \n    1\n which is its root. Then,\nfor each \n    i\n from \n    2\n to \n    n\n, a new vertex \n    i\n appears in the\ntree, and it becomes a child of vertex \n    p_i\n. It is guaranteed that after\neach step the tree will keep being a binary tree rooted at vertex \n    1\n,\nthat is, each vertex will have at most two children. After every new vertex is\nadded, print the smallest value of disbalance over all possible diverse\ncolorings of the current tree. Moreover, after adding the last vertex with the\nnumber \n    n\n, also print a diverse coloring with the smallest possible\ndisbalance as well. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first\nline contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n).\nThe description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of vertices in the final tree. The second line contains \n    n-1\n\nintegers \n    p_2, p_3, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 i - 1\n) \u2014 the\nnumbers of parents of vertices \n    2, 3, \n    \u2026, n\n. No integer appears\nmore than twice among \n    p_2, p_3, \n    \u2026, p_n\n. It is guaranteed that the\nsum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n.\nOutput For each test case, print \n    n-1\n integers \u2014 the smallest value of\ndisbalance over all possible diverse colorings of the tree after adding\nvertices \n    2, 3, \n    \u2026, n\n. Then print a string of \n    n\n characters\n'w' and 'b', describing a diverse coloring with the smallest possible\ndisbalance for the whole tree after adding vertex \n    n\n: the \n    i\n-th\ncharacter must be equal to 'w' if vertex \n    i\n is colored white, and 'b' if\nit's colored blue. The absolute value of the difference between the numbers of\n'w' and 'b' characters must be equal to the last printed integer. Each vertex\nmust have a parent or a child colored into the color opposite to the vertex's\ncolor.
