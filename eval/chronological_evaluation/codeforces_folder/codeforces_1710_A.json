        "name": "Color the Picture",
        "description": "A picture can be represented as an \n    n\n    \u00d7 m\n grid (\n    n\n rows and\n\n    m\n columns) so that each of the \n    n \n    \u00b7 m\n cells is colored with\none color. You have \n    k\n pigments of different colors. You have a limited\namount of each pigment, more precisely you can color at most \n    a_i\n cells\nwith the \n    i\n-th pigment. A picture is considered beautiful if each cell\nhas at least \n    3\n toroidal neighbors with the same color as itself. Two\ncells are considered toroidal neighbors if they toroidally share an edge. In\nother words, for some integers \n    1 \n    \u2264 x_1,x_2 \n    \u2264 n\n and \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    y_1,y_2 \n    \u2264 m\n, the cell in the \n    x_1\n-th row and \n    y_1\n-th column\nis a toroidal neighbor of the cell in the \n    x_2\n-th row and \n    y_2\n-th\ncolumn if one of following two conditions holds: \n    x_1-x_2 \n    \u2261\n    \u00b11\n    \n    n\n and \n    y_1=y_2\n, or \n    y_1-y_2 \n    \u2261\n    \u00b11 \n    m\n\nand \n    x_1=x_2\n. Notice that each cell has exactly \n    4\n toroidal\nneighbors. For example, if \n    n=3\n and \n    m=4\n, the toroidal neighbors of\nthe cell \n    (1, 2)\n (the cell on the first row and second column) are:\n\n    (3, 2)\n, \n    (2, 2)\n, \n    (1, 3)\n, \n    (1, 1)\n. They are shown in gray\non the image below: The gray cells show toroidal neighbors of \n    (1, 2)\n. Is\nit possible to color all cells with the pigments provided and create a\nbeautiful picture? Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first\nline contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n).\nThe description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, and \n    k\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n,m \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of the\npicture and the number of pigments. The next line contains \n    k\n integers\n\n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026, a_k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 \n    a_i\n is the\nmaximum number of cells that can be colored with the \n    i\n-th pigment. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    k\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print \"Yes\" (without quotes) if it is\npossible to color a beautiful picture. Otherwise, print \"No\" (without quotes).\nExample Input 6 4 6 3 12 9 8 3 3 2 8 8 3 3 2 9 5 4 5 2 10 11 5 4 2 9 11 10 10\n3 11 45 14 Output Yes No Yes Yes No No Note In the first test case, one\npossible solution is as follows: In the third test case, we can color all\ncells with pigment \n    1\n.\n\n",
