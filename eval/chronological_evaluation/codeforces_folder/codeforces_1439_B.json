        "description": "You are given an undirected graph with \n    n\n vertices and \n    m\n edges.\nAlso, you are given an integer \n    k\n. Find either a clique of size \n    k\n\nor a non-empty subset of vertices such that each vertex of this subset has at\nleast \n    k\n neighbors in the subset. If there are no such cliques and\nsubsets report about it. A subset of vertices is called a clique of size\n\n    k\n if its size is \n    k\n and there exists an edge between every two\nvertices from the subset. A vertex is called a neighbor of the other vertex if\nthere exists an edge between them. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\nnext lines contain descriptions of test cases. The first line of the\ndescription of each test case contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n,\n\n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m, k \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    k \n    \u2264 n\n). Each of the\nnext \n    m\n lines contains two integers \n    u, v\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 u, v \n    \u2264\n    n, u \n    \u2260 v)\n, denoting an edge between vertices \n    u\n and \n    v\n. It\nis guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n for all test cases and the sum of \n    m\n for all test\ncases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case: If you\nfound a subset of vertices such that each vertex of this subset has at least\n\n    k\n neighbors in the subset in the first line output \n    1\n and the size\nof the subset. On the second line output the vertices of the subset in any\norder. If you found a clique of size \n    k\n then in the first line output\n\n    2\n and in the second line output the vertices of the clique in any order.\nIf there are no required subsets and cliques print \n    -1\n. If there exists\nmultiple possible answers you can print any of them.

In the second test case: degree of each\nvertex in the original graph is at least \n    3\n. So the set of all vertices\nis a correct answer. In the third test case: there are no cliques of size\n\n    4\n or required subsets, so the answer is \n    -1\n.\n\n",
