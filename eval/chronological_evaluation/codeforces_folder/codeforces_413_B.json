        "description": "The R2 company has n employees working for it. The work involves constant\nexchange of ideas, sharing the stories of success and upcoming challenging.\nFor that, R2 uses a famous instant messaging program Spyke. R2 has m Spyke\nchats just to discuss all sorts of issues. In each chat, some group of\nemployees exchanges messages daily. An employee can simultaneously talk in\nmultiple chats. If some employee is in the k-th chat, he can write messages to\nthis chat and receive notifications about messages from this chat. If an\nemployee writes a message in the chat, all other participants of the chat\nreceive a message notification. The R2 company is conducting an audit. Now the\nspecialists study effective communication between the employees. For this\npurpose, they have a chat log and the description of chat structure. You, as\none of audit specialists, are commissioned to write a program that will use\nthis data to determine the total number of message notifications received by\neach employee. Input The first line contains three space-separated integers n,\nm and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^4; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10; 1 \u2264 k \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of the\nemployees, the number of chats and the number of events in the log,\ncorrespondingly. Next n lines contain matrix a of size n \u00d7 m, consisting of\nnumbers zero and one. The element of this matrix, recorded in the j-th column\nof the i-th line, (let's denote it as aij) equals 1, if the i-th employee is\nthe participant of the j-th chat, otherwise the element equals 0. Assume that\nthe employees are numbered from 1 to n and the chats are numbered from 1 to m.\nNext k lines contain the description of the log events. The i-th line contains\ntwo space-separated integers xi and yi (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 yi \u2264 m) which mean\nthat the employee number xi sent one message to chat number yi. It is\nguaranteed that employee number xi is a participant of chat yi. It is\nguaranteed that each chat contains at least two employees. Output Print in the\nsingle line n space-separated integers, where the i-th integer shows the\nnumber of message notifications the i-th employee receives.
