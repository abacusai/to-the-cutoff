        "name": "Perform Easily",
        "description": "After battling Shikamaru, Tayuya decided that her flute is too predictable,\nand replaced it with a guitar. The guitar has \n    6\n strings and an infinite\nnumber of frets numbered from \n    1\n. Fretting the fret number \n    j\n on the\n\n    i\n-th string produces the note \n    a_i + j\n. Tayuya wants to play a\nmelody of \n    n\n notes. Each note can be played on different string-fret\ncombination. The easiness of performance depends on the difference between the\nmaximal and the minimal indices of used frets. The less this difference is,\nthe easier it is to perform the technique. Please determine the minimal\npossible difference. For example, if \n    a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]\n, and the\nsequence of notes is \n    4, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13\n (corresponding to the\nsecond example), we can play the first note on the first string, and all the\nother notes on the sixth string. Then the maximal fret will be \n    10\n, the\nminimal one will be \n    3\n, and the answer is \n    10 - 3 = 7\n, as shown on\nthe picture. Input The first line contains \n    6\n space-separated numbers\n\n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n, ..., \n    a_6\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) which describe the Tayuya's strings. The second line contains the\nonly integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) standing for the\nnumber of notes in the melody. The third line consists of \n    n\n integers\n\n    b_1\n, \n    b_2\n, ..., \n    b_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i\n    \u2264\n    10^9\n), separated by space. They describe the notes to be played. It's\nguaranteed that \n    b_i > a_j\n for all \n    1\n    \u2264 i\n    \u2264 n\n and \n    1\n    \u2264\n    j\n    \u2264 6\n, in other words, you can play each note on any string. Output\nPrint the minimal possible difference of the maximal and the minimal indices\nof used frets. Examples Input 1 4 100 10 30 5 6 101 104 105 110 130 200 Output\n0 Input 1 1 2 2 3 3 7 13 4 11 12 11 13 12 Output 7 Note In the first sample\ntest it is optimal to play the first note on the first string, the second note\non the second string, the third note on the sixth string, the fourth note on\nthe fourth string, the fifth note on the fifth string, and the sixth note on\nthe third string. In this case the \n    100\n-th fret is used each time, so the\ndifference is \n    100 - 100 = 0\n. In the second test it's optimal, for\nexample, to play the second note on the first string, and all the other notes\non the sixth string. Then the maximal fret will be \n    10\n, the minimal one\nwill be \n    3\n, and the answer is \n    10 - 3 = 7\n.\n\n",
