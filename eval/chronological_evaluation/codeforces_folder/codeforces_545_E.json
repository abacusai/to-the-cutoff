        "description": "Little girl Susie accidentally found her elder brother's notebook. She has\nmany things to do, more important than solving problems, but she found this\nproblem too interesting, so she wanted to know its solution and decided to ask\nyou about it. So, the problem statement is as follows. Let's assume that we\nare given a connected weighted undirected graph G = (V, E) (here V is the set\nof vertices, E is the set of edges). The shortest-path tree from vertex u is\nsuch graph G1 = (V, E1) that is a tree with the set of edges E1 that is the\nsubset of the set of edges of the initial graph E, and the lengths of the\nshortest paths from u to any vertex to G and to G1 are the same. You are given\na connected weighted undirected graph G and vertex u. Your task is to find the\nshortest-path tree of the given graph from vertex u, the total weight of whose\nedges is minimum possible. Input The first line contains two numbers, n and m\n(1 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of vertices and edges of the\ngraph, respectively. Next m lines contain three integers each, representing an\nedge \u2014 ui, vi, wi \u2014 the numbers of vertices connected by an edge and the\nweight of the edge (ui \u2260 vi, 1 \u2264 wi \u2264 10^9). It is guaranteed that graph is\nconnected and that there is no more than one edge between any pair of\nvertices. The last line of the input contains integer u (1 \u2264 u \u2264 n) \u2014 the\nnumber of the start vertex. Output In the first line print the minimum total\nweight of the edges of the tree. In the next line print the indices of the\nedges that are included in the tree, separated by spaces. The edges are\nnumbered starting from 1 in the order they follow in the input. You may print\nthe numbers of the edges in any order. If there are multiple answers, print\nany of them. Examples Input 3 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 1 3 2 3 Output 2 1 2 Input 4 4 1 2\n1 2 3 1 3 4 1 4 1 2 4 Output 4 2 3 4 Note In the first sample there are two\npossible shortest path trees: with edges 1 \u2013 3 and 2 \u2013 3 (the total weight is\n3); with edges 1 \u2013 2 and 2 \u2013 3 (the total weight is 2); And, for example, a\ntree with edges 1 \u2013 2 and 1 \u2013 3 won't be a shortest path tree for vertex 3,\nbecause the distance from vertex 3 to vertex 2 in this tree equals 3, and in\nthe original graph it is 1.\n\n",
