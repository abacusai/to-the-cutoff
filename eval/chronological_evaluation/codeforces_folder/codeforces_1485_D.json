        "description": "You are given a matrix \n    a\n consisting of positive integers. It has \n    n\n\nrows and \n    m\n columns. Construct a matrix \n    b\n consisting of positive\nintegers. It should have the same size as \n    a\n, and the following\nconditions should be met: \n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i,j\n    \u2264 10^6\n; \n    b_i,j\n is a\nmultiple of \n    a_i,j\n; the absolute value of the difference between\nnumbers in any adjacent pair of cells (two cells that share the same side) in\n\n    b\n is equal to \n    k^4\n for some integer \n    k \n    \u2265 1\n (\n    k\n is not\nnecessarily the same for all pairs, it is own for each pair). We can show that\nthe answer always exists. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n\nand \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n,m \n    \u2264 500\n). Each of the following \n    n\n lines\ncontains \n    m\n integers. The \n    j\n-th integer in the \n    i\n-th line is\n\n    a_i,j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i,j\n    \u2264 16\n). Output The output should\ncontain \n    n\n lines each containing \n    m\n integers. The \n    j\n-th integer\nin the \n    i\n-th line should be \n    b_i,j\n. Examples Input 2 2 1 2 2 3\nOutput 1 2 2 3 Input 2 3 16 16 16 16 16 16 Output 16 32 48 32 48 64 Input 2 2\n3 11 12 8 Output 327 583 408 664 Note In the first example, the matrix \n    a\n\ncan be used as the matrix \n    b\n, because the absolute value of the\ndifference between numbers in any adjacent pair of cells is \n    1 = 1^4\n. In\nthe third example: \n    327\n is a multiple of \n    3\n, \n    583\n is a multiple\nof \n    11\n, \n    408\n is a multiple of \n    12\n, \n    664\n is a multiple of\n\n    8\n; \n    |408 - 327| = 3^4\n, \n    |583 - 327| = 4^4\n, \n    |664 - 408| =\n    4^4\n, \n    |664 - 583| = 3^4\n.\n\n",
