        "description": "The only difference between the two versions is that in this version \n    n\n    \n    \u2264 1000\n and the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    1000\n. A terminal is a row of \n    n\n equal segments numbered \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n in order. There are two terminals, one above the other. You are given\nan array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n. For all \n    i = 1, 2, \n    \u2026, n\n, there\nshould be a straight wire from some point on segment \n    i\n of the top\nterminal to some point on segment \n    a_i\n of the bottom terminal. You can't\nselect the endpoints of a segment. For example, the following pictures show\ntwo possible wirings if \n    n=7\n and \n    a=[4,1,4,6,7,7,5]\n. A crossing\noccurs when two wires share a point in common. In the picture above, crossings\nare circled in red. What is the maximum number of crossings there can be if\nyou place the wires optimally? Input The first line contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first\nline of each test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\nthe elements of the array. The sum of \n    n\n across all test cases does not\nexceed \n    1000\n. Output For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the\nmaximum number of crossings there can be if you place the wires optimally.\nExample Input 4 7 4 1 4 6 7 7 5 2 2 1 1 1 3 2 2 2 Output 6 1 0 3 Note The\nfirst test case is shown in the second picture in the statement. In the second\ntest case, the only wiring possible has the two wires cross, so the answer is\n\n    1\n. In the third test case, the only wiring possible has one wire, so the\nanswer is \n    0\n.\n\n",
