        "description": "There are currently \n    n\n hot topics numbered from \n    0\n to \n    n-1\n at\nyour local bridge club and \n    2^n\n players numbered from \n    0\n to\n\n    2^n-1\n. Each player holds a different set of views on those \n    n\n\ntopics, more specifically, the \n    i\n-th player holds a positive view on the\n\n    j\n-th topic if \n    i\n     \n    &\n     2^j > 0\n, and a negative view otherwise.\nHere \n    &\n denotes the bitwise AND operation. You are going to organize a\nbridge tournament capable of accommodating at most \n    k\n pairs of players\n(bridge is played in teams of two people). You can select teams arbitrarily\nwhile each player is in at most one team, but there is one catch: two players\ncannot be in the same pair if they disagree on \n    2\n or more of those\n\n    n\n topics, as they would argue too much during the play. You know that\nthe \n    i\n-th player will pay you \n    a_i\n dollars if they play in this\ntournament. Compute the maximum amount of money that you can earn if you pair\nthe players in your club optimally. Input The first line contains two integers\n\n    n\n, \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 20\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of hot topics and the number of pairs of players that your tournament\ncan accommodate. The second line contains \n    2^n\n integers \n    a_0, a_1,\n    \n    \u2026, a_2^n-1\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the amounts of money\nthat the players will pay to play in the tournament. Output Print one integer:\nthe maximum amount of money that you can earn if you pair the players in your\nclub optimally under the above conditions. Examples Input 3 1 8 3 5 7 1 10 3 2\nOutput 13 Input 2 3 7 4 5 7 Output 23 Input 3 2 1 9 1 5 7 8 1 1 Output 29 Note\nIn the first example, the best we can do is to pair together the \n    0\n-th\nplayer and the \n    2\n-nd player resulting in earnings of \n    8 + 5 = 13\n\ndollars. Although pairing the \n    0\n-th player with the \n    5\n-th player\nwould give us \n    8 + 10 = 18\n dollars, we cannot do this because those two\nplayers disagree on \n    2\n of the \n    3\n hot topics. In the second example,\nwe can pair the \n    0\n-th player with the \n    1\n-st player and pair the\n\n    2\n-nd player with the \n    3\n-rd player resulting in earnings of \n    7 + 4\n    + 5 + 7 = 23\n dollars.\n\n",
