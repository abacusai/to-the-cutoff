        "description": "Some number of people (this number is even) have stood in a circle. The people\nstand in the circle evenly. They are numbered clockwise starting from a person\nwith the number \n    1\n. Each person is looking through the circle's center at\nthe opposite person. A sample of a circle of \n    6\n persons. The orange\narrows indicate who is looking at whom. You don't know the exact number of\npeople standing in the circle (but this number is even, no doubt). It is known\nthat the person with the number \n    a\n is looking at the person with the\nnumber \n    b\n (and vice versa, of course). What is the number associated with\na person being looked at by the person with the number \n    c\n? If, for the\nspecified \n    a\n, \n    b\n, and \n    c\n, no such circle exists, output -1.\nInput The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. Each test case\nconsists of one line containing three distinct integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n,\n\n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a,b,c \n    \u2264 10^8\n). Output For each test case output in\na separate line a single integer \n    d\n \u2014 the number of the person being\nlooked at by the person with the number \n    c\n in a circle such that the\nperson with the number \n    a\n is looking at the person with the number\n\n    b\n. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. Output \n    -1\n\nif there's no circle meeting the given conditions. Example Input 7 6 2 4 2 3 1\n2 4 10 5 3 4 1 3 2 2 5 4 4 3 2 Output 8 -1 -1 -1 4 1 -1 Note In the first test\ncase, there's a desired circle of \n    8\n people. The person with the number\n\n    6\n will look at the person with the number \n    2\n and the person with\nthe number \n    8\n will look at the person with the number \n    4\n. In the\nsecond test case, there's no circle meeting the conditions. If the person with\nthe number \n    2\n is looking at the person with the number \n    3\n, the\ncircle consists of \n    2\n people because these persons are neighbors. But, in\nthis case, they must have the numbers \n    1\n and \n    2\n, but it doesn't meet\nthe problem's conditions. In the third test case, the only circle with the\npersons with the numbers \n    2\n and \n    4\n looking at each other consists of\n\n    4\n people. Therefore, the person with the number \n    10\n doesn't occur\nin the circle.\n\n",
