        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n of \n    n\n positive integers. Determine if, by\nrearranging the elements, you can make the array strictly increasing. In other\nwords, determine if it is possible to rearrange the elements such that \n    a_1\n    < a_2 < \n    \u2026 < a_n\n holds. Input The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first\nline of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    100\n) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the elements of\nthe array. Output For each test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if the\narray satisfies the condition, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can\noutput the answer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\"\nand \"YES\" will be recognized as a positive answer). Example Input 3 4 1 1 1 1\n5 8 7 1 3 4 1 5 Output NO YES YES Note In the first test case any\nrearrangement will keep the array \n    [1,1,1,1]\n, which is not strictly\nincreasing. In the second test case, you can make the array \n    [1,3,4,7,8]\n.\n\n",
