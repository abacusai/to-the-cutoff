        "description": "Let us call an edge-weighted tree with \n    n\n vertices numbered from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n good if the weight of each edge is either \n    1\n or \n    -1\n and\nfor each vertex \n    i\n, the product of the edge weights of all edges having\n\n    i\n as one endpoint is \n    -1\n. You are given a positive integer \n    n\n.\nThere are \n    n^n-2\n    \u00b7 2^n-1\n distinct\n    ^\n    \u2020\n edge-weighted\ntrees with \n    n\n vertices numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n such that each\nedge is either \n    1\n or \n    -1\n. Your task is to find the sum of\n\n    d(1,n)^\n of all such trees that are good. Since the answer can\nbe quite large, you only need to find it modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n.\n\n    ^\n    \u2020\n Two trees are considered to be distinct if either: there\nexists two vertices such that there is an edge between them in one of the\ntrees, and not in the other. there exists two vertices such that there is an\nedge between them in both trees but the weight of the edge between them in one\ntree is different from the one in the other tree. Note that by Cayley's\nformula, the number of trees on \n    n\n labeled vertices is \n    n^n-2\n.\nSince we have \n    n-1\n edges, there are \n    2^n-1\n possible assignment of\nweights(weight can either be \n    1\n or \n    -1\n). That is why total number of\ndistinct edge-weighted tree is \n    n^n-2\n    \u00b7 2^n-1\n.\n\n    ^\n \n    d(u,v)\n denotes the sum of the weight of all edges on\nthe unique simple path from \n    u\n to \n    v\n. Input The first and only line\nof input contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n). Output The only line of output should contain a single integer, the\nrequired answer, modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Examples Input 2 Output\n998244352 Input 1 Output 0 Input 4 Output 998244343 Input 10 Output 948359297\nInput 43434 Output 86232114 Note In the first test case, there is only \n    1\n\ndistinct good tree. The value of \n    d(1,2)\n for that tree is \n    -1\n, which\nis \n    998\n     244\n     352\n under modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. In the second\ntest case, the value of \n    d(1,1)\n for any tree is \n    0\n, so the answer is\n\n    0\n. In the third test case, there are \n    16\n distinct good trees. The\nvalue of \n    d(1,4)\n is: \n    -2\n for \n    2\n trees; \n    -1\n for \n    8\n\ntrees; \n    0\n for \n    4\n trees; \n    1\n for \n    2\n trees. The sum of\n\n    d(1,4)\n over all trees is \n    2 \n    \u00b7 (-2) + 8 \n    \u00b7 (-1) + 4 \n    \u00b7\n    (0) + 2 \n    \u00b7 (1) = -10\n, which is \n    998\n     244\n     343\n under modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353\n.\n\n",
