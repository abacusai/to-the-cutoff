        "description": "You are given five integers \n    n\n, \n    i\n, \n    j\n, \n    x\n, and \n    y\n.\nFind the number of bitonic permutations \n    B\n, of the numbers \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n, such that \n    B_i=x\n, and \n    B_j=y\n. Since the answer can be\nlarge, compute it modulo \n    10^9+7\n. A bitonic permutation is a permutation\nof numbers, such that the elements of the permutation first increase till a\ncertain index \n    k\n, \n    2 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n-1\n, and then decrease till the\nend. Refer to notes for further clarification. Input Each test contains\nmultiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test\ncases follows. The only line of each test case contains five integers,\n\n    n\n, \n    i\n, \n    j\n, \n    x\n, and \n    y\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n and\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 i,j,x,y \n    \u2264 n\n). It is guaranteed that \n    i < j\n and \n    x\n    \n     y\n. Output For each test case, output a single line containing the\nnumber of bitonic permutations satisfying the above conditions modulo\n\n    10^9+7\n.

For example, \n    [2,3,1,5,4]\n is a permutation, but\n\n    [1,2,2]\n is not a permutation (\n    2\n appears twice in the array) and\n\n    [1,3,4]\n is also not a permutation (\n    n=3\n but there is \n    4\n in the\narray). An array of \n    n \n    \u2265 3\n elements is bitonic if its elements are\nfirst increasing till an index \n    k\n, \n    2 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n-1\n, and then\ndecreasing till the end. For example, \n    [2,5,8,6,1]\n is a bitonic array\nwith \n    k=3\n, but \n    [2,5,8,1,6]\n is not a bitonic array (elements first\nincrease till \n    k=3\n, then decrease, and then increase again). A bitonic\npermutation is a permutation in which the elements follow the above-mentioned\nbitonic property. For example, \n    [2,3,5,4,1]\n is a bitonic permutation, but\n\n    [2,3,5,1,4]\n is not a bitonic permutation (since it is not a bitonic\narray) and \n    [2,3,4,4,1]\n is also not a bitonic permutation (since it is\nnot a permutation). Sample Test Case Description For \n    n=3\n, possible\npermutations are \n    [1,2,3]\n, \n    [1,3,2]\n, \n    [2,1,3]\n, \n    [2,3,1]\n,\n\n    [3,1,2]\n, and \n    [3,2,1]\n. Among the given permutations, the bitonic\npermutations are \n    [1,3,2]\n and \n    [2,3,1]\n. In the first test case, the\nexpected permutation must be of the form \n    [2,?,3]\n, which does not satisfy\neither of the two bitonic permutations with \n    n=3\n, therefore the answer is\n0. In the second test case, the expected permutation must be of the form\n\n    [?,3,2]\n, which only satisfies the bitonic permutation \n    [1,3,2]\n,\ntherefore, the answer is 1.\n\n",
