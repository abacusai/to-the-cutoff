        "description": "Petya and Vasya got employed as couriers. During the working day they are to\ndeliver packages to n different points on the line. According to the company's\ninternal rules, the delivery of packages must be carried out strictly in a\ncertain order. Initially, Petya is at the point with the coordinate s1, Vasya\nis at the point with the coordinate s2, and the clients are at the points x1,\nx2, ..., xn in the order of the required visit. The guys agree in advance who\nof them will deliver the package to which of the customers, and then they act\nas follows. When the package for the i-th client is delivered, the one who\ndelivers the package to the (i + 1)-st client is sent to the path (it can be\nthe same person who went to the point xi, or the other). The friend who is not\nbusy in delivering the current package, is standing still. To communicate with\neach other, the guys have got walkie-talkies. The walkie-talkies work rather\npoorly at great distances, so Petya and Vasya want to distribute the orders so\nthat the maximum distance between them during the day is as low as possible.\nHelp Petya and Vasya to minimize the maximum distance between them, observing\nall delivery rules. Input The first line contains three integers n, s1, s2 (1\n\u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 0 \u2264 s1, s2 \u2264 10^9) \u2014 number of points of delivery and starting\npositions of Petya and Vasya. The second line contains n integers x1, x2, ...,\nxn \u2014 customers coordinates (0 \u2264 xi \u2264 10^9), in the order to make a delivery.\nIt is guaranteed, that among the numbers s1, s2, x1, ..., xn there are no two\nequal. Output Output the only integer, minimum possible maximal distance\nbetween couriers during delivery. Examples Input 2 0 10 5 6 Output 10 Input 3\n2 1 3 4 5 Output 1 Input 1 4 5 2 Output 2 Note In the first test case the\ninitial distance between the couriers is 10. This value will be the answer,\nfor example, Petya can perform both deliveries, and Vasya will remain at the\nstarting point. In the second test case you can optimally act, for example,\nlike this: Vasya delivers the package to the first customer, Petya to the\nsecond and, finally, Vasya delivers the package to the third client. With this\norder of delivery, the distance between the couriers will never exceed 1. In\nthe third test case only two variants are possible: if the delivery of a\nsingle package is carried out by Petya, the maximum distance between them will\nbe 5 - 2 = 3. If Vasya will deliver the package, the maximum distance is 4 - 2\n= 2. The latter method is optimal.\n\n",
