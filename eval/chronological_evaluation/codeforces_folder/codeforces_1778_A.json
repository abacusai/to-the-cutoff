        "description": "You are given an array of \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n. The\nintegers are either \n    1\n or \n    -1\n. You have to perform the following\noperation exactly once on the array \n    a\n: Choose an index \n    i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 i < n\n) and flip the signs of \n    a_i\n and \n    a_i+1\n. Here,\nflipping the sign means \n    -1\n will be \n    1\n and \n    1\n will be \n    -1\n.\nWhat is the maximum possible value of \n    a_1 + a_2 + \n    \u2026 + a_n\n after\napplying the above operation? Input Each test contains multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    500\n). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test\ncase contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n), the\nlength of the array \n    a\n. The next line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    a_i = 1\n or \n    a_i = -1\n). The sum of \n    n\n\nover all cases doesn't exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print the\nmaximum possible sum of the array \n    a\n you can get in a separate line.\nExample Input 4 5 -1 1 1 -1 -1 5 1 1 -1 -1 -1 2 1 1 4 1 -1 -1 1 Output 3 3 -2\n4 Note In the first case, we can choose index \n    4\n and flip the signs of\n\n    a_4\n and \n    a_5\n. After this operation, the sum will be \n    -1+1+1+1+1 =\n    3\n. We can't make the sum larger than this. In the third case, the only\noption is to choose the index \n    1\n.\n\n",
