        "description": "n participants of the competition were split into m teams in some manner so\nthat each team has at least one participant. After the competition each pair\nof participants from the same team became friends. Your task is to write a\nprogram that will find the minimum and the maximum number of pairs of friends\nthat could have formed by the end of the competition. Input The only line of\ninput contains two integers n and m, separated by a single space (1 \u2264 m \u2264 n \u2264\n10^9) \u2014 the number of participants and the number of teams respectively.\nOutput The only line of the output should contain two integers kmin and kmax \u2014\nthe minimum possible number of pairs of friends and the maximum possible\nnumber of pairs of friends respectively. Examples Input 5 1 Output 10 10 Input\n3 2 Output 1 1 Input 6 3 Output 3 6 Note In the first sample all the\nparticipants get into one team, so there will be exactly ten pairs of friends.\nIn the second sample at any possible arrangement one team will always have two\nparticipants and the other team will always have one participant. Thus, the\nnumber of pairs of friends will always be equal to one. In the third sample\nminimum number of newly formed friendships can be achieved if participants\nwere split on teams consisting of 2 people, maximum number can be achieved if\nparticipants were split on teams of 1, 1 and 4 people.\n\n",
