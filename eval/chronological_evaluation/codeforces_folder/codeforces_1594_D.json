        "description": "Theofanis started playing the new online game called \"Among them\". However, he\nalways plays with Cypriot players, and they all have the same name: \"Andreas\"\n(the most common name in Cyprus). In each game, Theofanis plays with \n    n\n\nother players. Since they all have the same name, they are numbered from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n. The players write \n    m\n comments in the chat. A comment\nhas the structure of \"\n    i\n \n    j\n \n    c\n\" where \n    i\n and \n    j\n are\ntwo distinct integers and \n    c\n is a string (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i, j \n    \u2264 n\n;\n\n    i \n    \u2260 j\n; \n    c\n is either imposter or crewmate). The comment means\nthat player \n    i\n said that player \n    j\n has the role \n    c\n. An imposter\nalways lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth. Help Theofanis find the\nmaximum possible number of imposters among all the other Cypriot players, or\ndetermine that the comments contradict each other (see the notes for further\nexplanation). Note that each player has exactly one role: either imposter or\ncrewmate. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of each test case\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of players except Theofanis and the number of comments.\nEach of the next \n    m\n lines contains a comment made by the players of the\nstructure \"\n    i\n \n    j\n \n    c\n\" where \n    i\n and \n    j\n are two distinct\nintegers and \n    c\n is a string (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i, j \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    i \n    \u2260\n    j\n; \n    c\n is either imposter or crewmate). There can be multiple comments\nfor the same pair of \n    (i, j)\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of all\n\n    n\n does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n and the sum of all \n    m\n does\nnot exceed \n    5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print one integer\n\u2014 the maximum possible number of imposters. If the comments contradict each\nother, print \n    -1\n. Example Input 5 3 2 1 2 imposter 2 3 crewmate 5 4 1 3\ncrewmate 2 5 crewmate 2 4 imposter 3 4 imposter 2 2 1 2 imposter 2 1 crewmate\n3 5 1 2 imposter 1 2 imposter 3 2 crewmate 3 2 crewmate 1 3 imposter 5 0\nOutput 2 4 -1 2 5 Note In the first test case, imposters can be Andreas\n\n    2\n and \n    3\n. In the second test case, imposters can be Andreas\n\n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    3\n and \n    5\n. In the third test case, comments\ncontradict each other. This is because player \n    1\n says that player \n    2\n\nis an imposter, and player \n    2\n says that player \n    1\n is a crewmate. If\nplayer \n    1\n is a crewmate, then he must be telling the truth, so player\n\n    2\n must be an imposter. But if player \n    2\n is an imposter then he must\nbe lying, so player \n    1\n can't be a crewmate. Contradiction.\n\n",
