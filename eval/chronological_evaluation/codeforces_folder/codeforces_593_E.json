        "description": "Gosha's universe is a table consisting of n rows and m columns. Both the rows\nand columns are numbered with consecutive integers starting with 1. We will\nuse (r, c) to denote a cell located in the row r and column c. Gosha is often\ninvited somewhere. Every time he gets an invitation, he first calculates the\nnumber of ways to get to this place, and only then he goes. Gosha's house is\nlocated in the cell (1, 1). At any moment of time, Gosha moves from the cell\nhe is currently located in to a cell adjacent to it (two cells are adjacent if\nthey share a common side). Of course, the movement is possible only if such a\ncell exists, i.e. Gosha will not go beyond the boundaries of the table. Thus,\nfrom the cell (r, c) he is able to make a move to one of the cells (r - 1, c),\n(r, c - 1), (r + 1, c), (r, c + 1). Also, Ghosha can skip a move and stay in\nthe current cell (r, c). Besides the love of strange calculations, Gosha is\nallergic to cats, so he never goes to the cell that has a cat in it. Gosha\nknows exactly where and when he will be invited and the schedule of cats\ntravelling along the table. Formally, he has q records, the i-th of them has\none of the following forms: 1, xi, yi, ti \u2014 Gosha is invited to come to cell\n(xi, yi) at the moment of time ti. It is guaranteed that there is no cat\ninside cell (xi, yi) at this moment of time. 2, xi, yi, ti \u2014 at the moment ti\na cat appears in cell (xi, yi). It is guaranteed that no other cat is located\nin this cell (xi, yi) at that moment of time. 3, xi, yi, ti \u2014 at the moment ti\na cat leaves cell (xi, yi). It is guaranteed that there is cat located in the\ncell (xi, yi). Gosha plans to accept only one invitation, but he has not yet\ndecided, which particular one. In order to make this decision, he asks you to\ncalculate for each of the invitations i the number of ways to get to the cell\n(xi, yi) at the moment ti. For every invitation, assume that Gosha he starts\nmoving from cell (1, 1) at the moment 1. Moving between two neighboring cells\ntakes Gosha exactly one unit of tim. In particular, this means that Gosha can\ncome into the cell only if a cat sitting in it leaves the moment when Gosha\nbegins his movement from the neighboring cell, and if none of the cats comes\nto the cell at the time when Gosha is in it. Two ways to go from cell (1, 1)\nto cell (x, y) at time t are considered distinct if for at least one moment of\ntime from 1 to t Gosha's positions are distinct for the two ways at this\nmoment. Note, that during this travel Gosha is allowed to visit both (1, 1)\nand (x, y) multiple times. Since the number of ways can be quite large, print\nit modulo 10^9 + 7. Input The first line of the input contains three positive\nintegers n, m and q (1 \u2264 n\u00b7m \u2264 20, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10 000) \u2014 the number of rows and\ncolumns in the table and the number of events respectively. Next q lines\ndescribe the events, each description contains four integers tpi, xi, yi and\nti (1 \u2264 tp \u2264 3, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y \u2264 m, 2 \u2264 t \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the type of the event (1\nif Gosha gets an invitation, 2 if a cat comes to the cell and 3 if a cat\nleaves the cell), the coordinates of the cell where the action takes place and\nthe moment of time at which the action takes place respectively. It is\nguaranteed that the queries are given in the chronological order, i.e. ti < ti\n+ 1. Output For each invitation i (that is, tpi = 1) calculate the number of\nways to get to cell (xi, yi) at the moment of time ti. Respond to the\ninvitations chronologically, that is, in the order they appear in the input.\nExamples Input 1 3 3 2 1 2 3 3 1 2 5 1 1 1 7 Output 5 Input 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 1 3\n3 5 1 3 3 7 Output 2 42 Input 4 5 5 2 2 5 3 2 2 4 6 3 2 4 9 1 4 4 13 1 4 4 15\nOutput 490902 10598759 Note Explanation of the first sample. Each picture\nspecifies the number of ways to arrive at the cell at the appropriate time. (X\nstands for a cell blocked at this particular moment of time) Time moment 1.\nTime moment 2.
