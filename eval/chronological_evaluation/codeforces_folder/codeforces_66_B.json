        "description": "Little Petya often travels to his grandmother in the countryside. The\ngrandmother has a large garden, which can be represented as a rectangle 1 \u00d7 n\nin size, when viewed from above. This rectangle is divided into n equal square\nsections. The garden is very unusual as each of the square sections possesses\nits own fixed height and due to the newest irrigation system we can create\nartificial rain above each section. Creating artificial rain is an expensive\noperation. That's why we limit ourselves to creating the artificial rain only\nabove one section. At that, the water from each watered section will flow into\nits neighbouring sections if their height does not exceed the height of the\nsection. That is, for example, the garden can be represented by a 1 \u00d7 5\nrectangle, where the section heights are equal to 4, 2, 3, 3, 2. Then if we\ncreate an artificial rain over any of the sections with the height of 3, the\nwater will flow over all the sections, except the ones with the height of 4.\nSee the illustration of this example at the picture: As Petya is keen on\nprogramming, he decided to find such a section that if we create artificial\nrain above it, the number of watered sections will be maximal. Help him. Input\nThe first line contains a positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000). The second line\ncontains n positive integers which are the height of the sections. All the\nnumbers are no less than 1 and not more than 1000. Output Print a single\nnumber, the maximal number of watered sections if we create artificial rain\nabove exactly one section. Examples Input 1 2 Output 1 Input 5 1 2 1 2 1\nOutput 3 Input 8 1 2 1 1 1 3 3 4 Output 6\n\n",
