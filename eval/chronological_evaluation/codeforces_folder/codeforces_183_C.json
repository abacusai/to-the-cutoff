        "description": "You are given a directed graph G with n vertices and m arcs (multiple arcs and\nself-loops are allowed). You have to paint each vertex of the graph into one\nof the k (k \u2264 n) colors in such way that for all arcs of the graph leading\nfrom a vertex u to vertex v, vertex v is painted with the next color of the\ncolor used to paint vertex u. The colors are numbered cyclically 1 through k.\nThis means that for each color i (i < k) its next color is color i + 1. In\naddition, the next color of color k is color 1. Note, that if k = 1, then the\nnext color for color 1 is again color 1. Your task is to find and print the\nlargest possible value of k (k \u2264 n) such that it's possible to color G as\ndescribed above with k colors. Note that you don't necessarily use all the k\ncolors (that is, for each color i there does not necessarily exist a vertex\nthat is colored with color i). Input The first line contains two space-\nseparated integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5), denoting the number of vertices\nand the number of arcs of the given digraph, respectively. Then m lines\nfollow, each line will contain two space-separated integers ai and bi (1 \u2264 ai,\nbi \u2264 n), which means that the i-th arc goes from vertex ai to vertex bi.\nMultiple arcs and self-loops are allowed. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the\nmaximum possible number of the colors that can be used to paint the digraph\n(i.e. k, as described in the problem statement). Note that the desired value\nof k must satisfy the inequality 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. Examples Input 4 4 1 2 2 1 3 4 4 3\nOutput 2 Input 5 2 1 4 2 5 Output 5 Input 4 5 1 2 2 3 3 1 2 4 4 1 Output 3\nInput 4 4 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 Output 1 Note For the first example, with k = 2,\nthis picture depicts the two colors (arrows denote the next color of that\ncolor). With k = 2 a possible way to paint the graph is as follows. It can be\nproven that no larger value for k exists for this test case. For the second\nexample, here's the picture of the k = 5 colors. A possible coloring of the\ngraph is: For the third example, here's the picture of the k = 3 colors. A\npossible coloring of the graph is:\n\n",
