But Willy grew rather bored of\nsuch numbers, so he came up with a few games that were connected with them.\nChilly Willy wants to find the minimum number of length n, such that it is\nsimultaneously divisible by all numbers Willy already knows (2, 3, 5 and 7).\nHelp him with that. A number's length is the number of digits in its decimal\nrepresentation without leading zeros. Input A single input line contains a\nsingle integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). Output Print a single integer \u2014 the answer to\nthe problem without leading zeroes, or \"-1\" (without the quotes), if the\nnumber that meet the problem condition does not exist. Examples Input 1 Output\n-1 Input 5 Output 10080\n\n",
