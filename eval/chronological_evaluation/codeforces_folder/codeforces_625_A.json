        "description": "Kolya Gerasimov loves kefir very much. He lives in year 1984 and knows all the\ndetails of buying this delicious drink. One day, as you probably know, he\nfound himself in year 2084, and buying kefir there is much more complicated.\nKolya is hungry, so he went to the nearest milk shop. In 2084 you may buy\nkefir in a plastic liter bottle, that costs a rubles, or in glass liter\nbottle, that costs b rubles. Also, you may return empty glass bottle and get c\n(c < b) rubles back, but you cannot return plastic bottles. Kolya has n rubles\nand he is really hungry, so he wants to drink as much kefir as possible. There\nwere no plastic bottles in his 1984, so Kolya doesn't know how to act\noptimally and asks for your help. Input First line of the input contains a\nsingle integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^18) \u2014 the number of rubles Kolya has at the\nbeginning. Then follow three lines containing integers a, b and c (1 \u2264 a \u2264\n10^18, 1 \u2264 c < b \u2264 10^18) \u2014 the cost of one plastic liter bottle, the cost of\none glass liter bottle and the money one can get back by returning an empty\nglass bottle, respectively. Output Print the only integer \u2014 maximum number of\nliters of kefir, that Kolya can drink. Examples Input 10 11 9 8 Output 2 Input\n10 5 6 1 Output 2 Note In the first sample, Kolya can buy one glass bottle,\nthen return it and buy one more glass bottle. Thus he will drink 2 liters of\nkefir. In the second sample, Kolya can buy two plastic bottle and get two\nliters of kefir, or he can buy one liter glass bottle, then return it and buy\none plastic bottle. In both cases he will drink two liters of kefir.\n\n",
