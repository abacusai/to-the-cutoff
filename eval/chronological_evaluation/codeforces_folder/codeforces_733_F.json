        "name": "Drivers Dissatisfaction",
        "description": "In one kingdom there are n cities and m two-way roads. Each road connects a\npair of cities, and for each road we know the level of drivers dissatisfaction\n\u2014 the value wi. For each road we know the value ci \u2014 how many lamziks we\nshould spend to reduce the level of dissatisfaction with this road by one.\nThus, to reduce the dissatisfaction with the i-th road by k, we should spend\nk\u00b7ci lamziks. And it is allowed for the dissatisfaction to become zero or even\nnegative. In accordance with the king's order, we need to choose n - 1 roads\nand make them the main roads. An important condition must hold: it should be\npossible to travel from any city to any other by the main roads. The road\nministry has a budget of S lamziks for the reform. The ministry is going to\nspend this budget for repair of some roads (to reduce the dissatisfaction with\nthem), and then to choose the n - 1 main roads. Help to spend the budget in\nsuch a way and then to choose the main roads so that the total dissatisfaction\nwith the main roads will be as small as possible. The dissatisfaction with\nsome roads can become negative. It is not necessary to spend whole budget S.\nIt is guaranteed that it is possible to travel from any city to any other\nusing existing roads. Each road in the kingdom is a two-way road. Input The\nfirst line contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5, n - 1 \u2264 m \u2264 2\u00b710^5)\n\u2014 the number of cities and the number of roads in the kingdom, respectively.\nThe second line contains m integers w1, w2, ..., wm (1 \u2264 wi \u2264 10^9), where wi\nis the drivers dissatisfaction with the i-th road. The third line contains m\nintegers c1, c2, ..., cm (1 \u2264 ci \u2264 10^9), where ci is the cost (in lamziks) of\nreducing the dissatisfaction with the i-th road by one. The next m lines\ncontain the description of the roads. The i-th of this lines contain a pair of\nintegers ai and bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 n, ai \u2260 bi) which mean that the i-th road\nconnects cities ai and bi. All roads are two-way oriented so it is possible to\nmove by the i-th road from ai to bi, and vice versa. It is allowed that a pair\nof cities is connected by more than one road. The last line contains one\ninteger S (0 \u2264 S \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of lamziks which we can spend for\nreforms. Output In the first line print K \u2014 the minimum possible total\ndissatisfaction with main roads. In each of the next n - 1 lines print two\nintegers x, vx, which mean that the road x is among main roads and the road x,\nafter the reform, has the level of dissatisfaction vx. Consider that roads are\nnumbered from 1 to m in the order as they are given in the input data. The\nedges can be printed in arbitrary order. If there are several answers, print\nany of them.
