        "description": "You are given \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n, where \n    n\n is\nodd. You are allowed to flip the sign of some (possibly all or none) of them.\nYou wish to perform these flips in such a way that the following conditions\nhold: At least \n    n - 1/2\n of the adjacent differences \n    a_i +\n    1 - a_i\n for \n    i = 1, 2, \n    \u2026, n - 1\n are greater than or equal to\n\n    0\n. At least \n    n - 1/2\n of the adjacent differences \n    a_i\n    + 1 - a_i\n for \n    i = 1, 2, \n    \u2026, n - 1\n are less than or equal to\n\n    0\n. Find any valid way to flip the signs. It can be shown that under the\ngiven constraints, there always exists at least one choice of signs to flip\nthat satisfies the required condition. If there are several solutions, you can\nfind any of them. Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The first\nline contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 500\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each\ntest case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 99\n, \n    n\n is\nodd) \u2014 the number of integers given to you. The second line of each test case\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the numbers themselves. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10000\n. Output For each test\ncase, print \n    n\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n, corresponding to\nthe integers after flipping signs. \n    b_i\n has to be equal to either\n\n    a_i\n or \n    -a_i\n, and of the adjacent differences \n    b_i + 1 - b_i\n\nfor \n    i = 1, \n    \u2026, n - 1\n, at least \n    n - 1/2\n should be\nnon-negative and at least \n    n - 1/2\n should be non-positive. It\ncan be shown that under the given constraints, there always exists at least\none choice of signs to flip that satisfies the required condition. If there\nare several solutions, you can find any of them. Example Input 5 3 -2 4 3 5 1\n1 1 1 1 5 -2 4 7 -6 4 9 9 7 -4 -2 1 -3 9 -4 -5 9 -4 1 9 4 8 9 5 1 -9 Output -2\n-4 3 1 1 1 1 1 -2 -4 7 -6 4 -9 -7 -4 2 1 -3 -9 -4 -5 4 -1 -9 -4 -8 -9 -5 -1 9\nNote In the first test case, the difference \n    (-4) - (-2) = -2\n is non-\npositive, while the difference \n    3 - (-4) = 7\n is non-negative. In the\nsecond test case, we don't have to flip any signs. All \n    4\n differences are\nequal to \n    0\n, which is both non-positive and non-negative. In the third\ntest case, \n    7 - (-4)\n and \n    4 - (-6)\n are non-negative, while \n    (-4) -\n    (-2)\n and \n    (-6) - 7\n are non-positive.\n\n",
