        "description": "Polycarp likes arithmetic progressions. A sequence \n    [a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n]\n is called an arithmetic progression if for each \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i\n    < n\n) the value \n    a_i+1 - a_i\n is the same. For example, the sequences\n\n    [42]\n, \n    [5, 5, 5]\n, \n    [2, 11, 20, 29]\n and \n    [3, 2, 1, 0]\n are\narithmetic progressions, but \n    [1, 0, 1]\n, \n    [1, 3, 9]\n and \n    [2, 3,\n    1]\n are not. It follows from the definition that any sequence of length one\nor two is an arithmetic progression. Polycarp found some sequence of positive\nintegers \n    [b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n]\n. He agrees to change each element by\nat most one. In the other words, for each element there are exactly three\noptions: an element can be decreased by \n    1\n, an element can be increased\nby \n    1\n, an element can be left unchanged. Determine a minimum possible\nnumber of elements in \n    b\n which can be changed (by exactly one), so that\nthe sequence \n    b\n becomes an arithmetic progression, or report that it is\nimpossible. It is possible that the resulting sequence contains element equals\n\n    0\n. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 100\n     000)\n \u2014 the number of elements in \n    b\n. The second line\ncontains a sequence \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9)\n. Output If it is impossible to make an arithmetic progression with\ndescribed operations, print -1. In the other case, print non-negative integer\n\u2014 the minimum number of elements to change to make the given sequence becomes\nan arithmetic progression. The only allowed operation is to add/to subtract\none from an element (can't use operation twice to the same position). Examples\nInput 4 24 21 14 10 Output 3 Input 2 500 500 Output 0 Input 3 14 5 1 Output -1\nInput 5 1 3 6 9 12 Output 1 Note In the first example Polycarp should increase\nthe first number on \n    1\n, decrease the second number on \n    1\n, increase\nthe third number on \n    1\n, and the fourth number should left unchanged. So,\nafter Polycarp changed three elements by one, his sequence became equals to\n\n    [25, 20, 15, 10]\n, which is an arithmetic progression. In the second\nexample Polycarp should not change anything, because his sequence is an\narithmetic progression. In the third example it is impossible to make an\narithmetic progression. In the fourth example Polycarp should change only the\nfirst element, he should decrease it on one. After that his sequence will\nlooks like \n    [0, 3, 6, 9, 12]\n, which is an arithmetic progression.\n\n",
