        "description": "You are given an undirected unweighted tree consisting of \n    n\n vertices. An\nundirected tree is a connected undirected graph with \n    n - 1\n edges. Your\ntask is to choose two pairs of vertices of this tree (all the chosen vertices\nshould be distinct) \n    (x_1, y_1)\n and \n    (x_2, y_2)\n in such a way that\nneither \n    x_1\n nor \n    y_1\n belong to the simple path from \n    x_2\n to\n\n    y_2\n and vice versa (neither \n    x_2\n nor \n    y_2\n should not belong to\nthe simple path from \n    x_1\n to \n    y_1\n). It is guaranteed that it is\npossible to choose such pairs for the given tree. Among all possible ways to\nchoose such pairs you have to choose one with the maximum number of common\nvertices between paths from \n    x_1\n to \n    y_1\n and from \n    x_2\n to\n\n    y_2\n. And among all such pairs you have to choose one with the maximum\ntotal length of these two paths. It is guaranteed that the answer with at\nleast two common vertices exists for the given tree. The length of the path is\nthe number of edges in it. The simple path is the path that visits each vertex\nat most once. Input The first line contains an integer \n    n\n \u2014 the number of\nvertices in the tree (\n    6 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). Each of the next\n\n    n - 1\n lines describes the edges of the tree. Edge \n    i\n is denoted by\ntwo integers \n    u_i\n and \n    v_i\n, the labels of vertices it connects (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    u_i \n     v_i\n). It is guaranteed that the\ngiven edges form a tree. It is guaranteed that the answer with at least two\ncommon vertices exists for the given tree. Output Print any two pairs of\nvertices satisfying the conditions described in the problem statement. It is\nguaranteed that it is possible to choose such pairs for the given tree.\nExamples Input 7 1 4 1 5 1 6 2 3 2 4 4 7 Output 3 6 7 5 Input 9 9 3 3 5 1 2 4\n3 4 7 1 7 4 6 3 8 Output 2 9 6 8 Input 10 6 8 10 3 3 7 5 8 1 7 7 2 2 9 2 8 1 4\nOutput 10 6 4 5 Input 11 1 2 2 3 3 4 1 5 1 6 6 7 5 8 5 9 4 10 4 11 Output 9 11\n8 10 Note The picture corresponding to the first example: The intersection of\ntwo paths is \n    2\n (vertices \n    1\n and \n    4\n) and the total length is\n\n    4 + 3 = 7\n. The picture corresponding to the second example: The\nintersection of two paths is \n    2\n (vertices \n    3\n and \n    4\n) and the\ntotal length is \n    5 + 3 = 8\n. The picture corresponding to the third\nexample: The intersection of two paths is \n    3\n (vertices \n    2\n, \n    7\n\nand \n    8\n) and the total length is \n    5 + 5 = 10\n. The picture\ncorresponding to the fourth example: The intersection of two paths is \n    5\n\n(vertices \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    3\n, \n    4\n and \n    5\n) and the total length\nis \n    6 + 6 = 12\n.\n\n",
