        "description": "Did you think there was going to be a JoJo legend here? But no, that was me,\nDio! Given a binary string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n, consisting of characters\n0 and 1. Let's build a square table of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 n\n, consisting of\n0 and 1 characters as follows. In the first row of the table write the\noriginal string \n    s\n. In the second row of the table write cyclic shift of\nthe string \n    s\n by one to the right. In the third row of the table, write\nthe cyclic shift of line \n    s\n by two to the right. And so on. Thus, the row\nwith number \n    k\n will contain a cyclic shift of string \n    s\n by \n    k\n\nto the right. The rows are numbered from \n    0\n to \n    n - 1\n top-to-bottom.\nIn the resulting table we need to find the rectangle consisting only of ones\nthat has the largest area. We call a rectangle the set of all cells \n    (i,\n    j)\n in the table, such that \n    x_1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 x_2\n and \n    y_1 \n    \u2264 j\n    \n    \u2264 y_2\n for some integers \n    0 \n    \u2264 x_1 \n    \u2264 x_2 < n\n and \n    0 \n    \u2264\n    y_1 \n    \u2264 y_2 < n\n. Recall that the cyclic shift of string \n    s\n by\n\n    k\n to the right is the string \n    s_n-k+1\n    \u2026 s_n s_1 s_2 \n    \u2026\n    s_n-k\n. For example, the cyclic shift of the string \"01011\" by \n    0\n to\nthe right is the string itself \"01011\", its cyclic shift by \n    3\n to the\nright is the string \"01101\". Input Each test consists of multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first and the only line of each test case contains a single binary string\n\n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    | s \n    |\n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n), consisting\nof characters 0 and 1. It is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths\n\n    |s|\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case, output a single integer \u2014 the maximum area of a rectangle\nconsisting only of ones. If there is no such rectangle, output \n    0\n.\nExample Input 5 0 1 101 011110 101010 Output 0 1 2 6 1 Note In the first test\ncase, there is a table \n    1 \n    \u00d7 1\n consisting of a single character 0,\nso there are no rectangles consisting of ones, and the answer is \n    0\n. In\nthe second test case, there is a table \n    1 \n    \u00d7 1\n, consisting of a\nsingle character 1, so the answer is \n    1\n. In the third test case, there is\na table: 101110011 In the fourth test case, there is a table:\n011110001111100111110011111001111100 In the fifth test case, there is a table:\n101010010101101010010101101010010101 Rectangles with maximum area are shown in\nbold.\n\n",
