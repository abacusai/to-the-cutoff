        "description": "Polycarp urgently needs a shovel! He comes to the shop and chooses an\nappropriate one. The shovel that Policarp chooses is sold for k burles. Assume\nthat there is an unlimited number of such shovels in the shop. In his pocket\nPolycarp has an unlimited number of \"10-burle coins\" and exactly one coin of r\nburles (1 \u2264 r \u2264 9). What is the minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy\nso that he can pay for the purchase without any change? It is obvious that he\ncan pay for 10 shovels without any change (by paying the requied amount of\n10-burle coins and not using the coin of r burles). But perhaps he can buy\nfewer shovels and pay without any change. Note that Polycarp should buy at\nleast one shovel. Input The single line of input contains two integers k and r\n(1 \u2264 k \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 r \u2264 9) \u2014 the price of one shovel and the denomination of\nthe coin in Polycarp's pocket that is different from \"10-burle coins\".\nRemember that he has an unlimited number of coins in the denomination of 10,\nthat is, Polycarp has enough money to buy any number of shovels. Output Print\nthe required minimum number of shovels Polycarp has to buy so that he can pay\nfor them without any change. Examples Input 117 3 Output 9 Input 237 7 Output\n1 Input 15 2 Output 2 Note In the first example Polycarp can buy 9 shovels and\npay 9\u00b7117 = 1053 burles. Indeed, he can pay this sum by using 10-burle coins\nand one 3-burle coin. He can't buy fewer shovels without any change. In the\nsecond example it is enough for Polycarp to buy one shovel. In the third\nexample Polycarp should buy two shovels and pay 2\u00b715 = 30 burles. It is\nobvious that he can pay this sum without any change.\n\n",
