        "description": "Nastya just made a huge mistake and dropped a whole package of rice on the\nfloor. Mom will come soon. If she sees this, then Nastya will be punished. In\ntotal, Nastya dropped \n    n\n grains. Nastya read that each grain weighs some\ninteger number of grams from \n    a - b\n to \n    a + b\n, inclusive (numbers\n\n    a\n and \n    b\n are known), and the whole package of \n    n\n grains weighs\nfrom \n    c - d\n to \n    c + d\n grams, inclusive (numbers \n    c\n and \n    d\n\nare known). The weight of the package is the sum of the weights of all \n    n\n\ngrains in it. Help Nastya understand if this information can be correct. In\nother words, check whether each grain can have such a mass that the \n    i\n-th\ngrain weighs some integer number \n    x_i\n \n    (a - b \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 a +\n    b)\n, and in total they weigh from \n    c - d\n to \n    c + d\n, inclusive\n(\n    c - d \n    \u2264\n    \u2211\n    _i=1^nx_i\n    \u2264 c + d\n). Input The\ninput consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000)\n \u2014 the number of test cases. The\nnext \n    t\n lines contain descriptions of the test cases, each line contains\n\n    5\n integers: \n    n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000)\n \u2014 the number of\ngrains that Nastya counted and \n    a, b, c, d\n \n    (0 \n    \u2264 b < a \n    \u2264\n    1000, 0 \n    \u2264 d < c \n    \u2264 1000)\n \u2014 numbers that determine the possible\nweight of one grain of rice (from \n    a - b\n to \n    a + b\n) and the possible\ntotal weight of the package (from \n    c - d\n to \n    c + d\n). Output For each\ntest case given in the input print \"Yes\", if the information about the weights\nis not inconsistent, and print \"No\" if \n    n\n grains with masses from \n    a -\n    b\n to \n    a + b\n cannot make a package with a total mass from \n    c - d\n\nto \n    c + d\n. Example Input 5 7 20 3 101 18 11 11 10 234 2 8 9 7 250 122 19\n41 21 321 10 3 10 8 6 1 Output Yes No Yes No Yes Note In the first test case\nof the example, we can assume that each grain weighs \n    17\n grams, and a\npack \n    119\n grams, then really Nastya could collect the whole pack. In the\nthird test case of the example, we can assume that each grain weighs \n    16\n\ngrams, and a pack \n    128\n grams, then really Nastya could collect the whole\npack. In the fifth test case of the example, we can be assumed that \n    3\n\ngrains of rice weigh \n    2\n, \n    2\n, and \n    3\n grams, and a pack is\n\n    7\n grams, then really Nastya could collect the whole pack. In the second\nand fourth test cases of the example, we can prove that it is impossible to\ndetermine the correct weight of all grains of rice and the weight of the pack\nso that the weight of the pack is equal to the total weight of all collected\ngrains.\n\n",
