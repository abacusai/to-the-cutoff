        "description": "John has just bought a new car and is planning a journey around the country.\nCountry has N cities, some of which are connected by bidirectional roads.\nThere are N - 1 roads and every city is reachable from any other city. Cities\nare labeled from 1 to N. John first has to select from which city he will\nstart his journey. After that, he spends one day in a city and then travels to\na randomly choosen city which is directly connected to his current one and\nwhich he has not yet visited. He does this until he can't continue obeying\nthese rules. To select the starting city, he calls his friend Jack for advice.\nJack is also starting a big casino business and wants to open casinos in some\nof the cities (max 1 per city, maybe nowhere). Jack knows John well and he\nknows that if he visits a city with a casino, he will gamble exactly once\nbefore continuing his journey. He also knows that if John enters a casino in a\ngood mood, he will leave it in a bad mood and vice versa. Since he is John's\nfriend, he wants him to be in a good mood at the moment when he finishes his\njourney. John is in a good mood before starting the journey. In how many ways\ncan Jack select a starting city for John and cities where he will build\ncasinos such that no matter how John travels, he will be in a good mood at the\nend? Print answer modulo 10^9 + 7. Input In the first line, a positive integer\nN (1 \u2264 N \u2264 100000), the number of cities. In the next N - 1 lines, two numbers\na, b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 N) separated by a single space meaning that cities a and b\nare connected by a bidirectional road. Output Output one number, the answer to\nthe problem modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input 2 1 2 Output 4 Input 3 1 2 2 3\nOutput 10 Note Example 1: If Jack selects city 1 as John's starting city, he\ncan either build 0 casinos, so John will be happy all the time, or build a\ncasino in both cities, so John would visit a casino in city 1, become unhappy,\nthen go to city 2, visit a casino there and become happy and his journey ends\nthere because he can't go back to city 1. If Jack selects city 2 for start,\neverything is symmetrical, so the answer is 4. Example 2: If Jack tells John\nto start from city 1, he can either build casinos in 0 or 2 cities (total 4\npossibilities). If he tells him to start from city 2, then John's journey will\neither contain cities 2 and 1 or 2 and 3. Therefore, Jack will either have to\nbuild no casinos, or build them in all three cities. With other options, he\nrisks John ending his journey unhappy. Starting from 3 is symmetric to\nstarting from 1, so in total we have 4 + 2 + 4 = 10 options.\n\n",
