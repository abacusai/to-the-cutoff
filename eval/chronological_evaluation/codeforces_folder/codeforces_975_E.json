        "description": "Hag is a very talented person. He has always had an artist inside him but his\nfather forced him to study mechanical engineering. Yesterday he spent all of\nhis time cutting a giant piece of wood trying to make it look like a goose.\nAnyway, his dad found out that he was doing arts rather than studying\nmechanics and other boring subjects. He confronted Hag with the fact that he\nis a spoiled son that does not care about his future, and if he continues to\ndo arts he will cut his 25 Lira monthly allowance. Hag is trying to prove to\nhis dad that the wooden piece is a project for mechanics subject. He also told\nhis dad that the wooden piece is a strictly convex polygon with \n    n\n\nvertices. Hag brought two pins and pinned the polygon with them in the\n\n    1\n-st and \n    2\n-nd vertices to the wall. His dad has \n    q\n queries to\nHag of two types. \n    1\n \n    f\n \n    t\n: pull a pin from the vertex \n    f\n,\nwait for the wooden polygon to rotate under the gravity force (if it will\nrotate) and stabilize. And then put the pin in vertex \n    t\n. \n    2\n\n\n    v\n: answer what are the coordinates of the vertex \n    v\n. Please help\nHag to answer his father's queries. You can assume that the wood that forms\nthe polygon has uniform density and the polygon has a positive thickness, same\nin all points. After every query of the 1-st type Hag's dad tries to move the\npolygon a bit and watches it stabilize again. Input The first line contains\ntwo integers \n    n\n and \n    q\n (\n    3\n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 200000\n) \u2014 the number of vertices in the polygon and the\nnumber of queries. The next \n    n\n lines describe the wooden polygon, the\n\n    i\n-th line contains two integers \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n (\n    |x_i|,\n    |y_i|\n    \u2264 10^8\n) \u2014 the coordinates of the \n    i\n-th vertex of the\npolygon. It is guaranteed that polygon is strictly convex and the vertices are\ngiven in the counter-clockwise order and all vertices are distinct. The next\n\n    q\n lines describe the queries, one per line. Each query starts with its\ntype \n    1\n or \n    2\n. Each query of the first type continues with two\nintegers \n    f\n and \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 f, t \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the vertex the pin\nis taken from, and the vertex the pin is put to and the polygon finishes\nrotating. It is guaranteed that the vertex \n    f\n contains a pin. Each query\nof the second type continues with a single integer \n    v\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 v \n    \u2264\n    n\n) \u2014 the vertex the coordinates of which Hag should tell his father. It is\nguaranteed that there is at least one query of the second type. Output The\noutput should contain the answer to each query of second type \u2014 two numbers in\na separate line. Your answer is considered correct, if its absolute or\nrelative error does not exceed \n    10^-4\n. Formally, let your answer be\n\n    a\n, and the jury's answer be \n    b\n. Your answer is considered correct\nif \n    |a - b|/\n    max(1, |b|)\n    \u2264 10^-4\n Examples Input 3 4 0\n0 2 0 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 3 Output 3.4142135624 -1.4142135624 2.0000000000\n0.0000000000 0.5857864376 -1.4142135624 Input 3 2 -1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 1\nOutput 1.0000000000 -1.0000000000 Note In the first test note the initial and\nthe final state of the wooden polygon. Red Triangle is the initial state and\nthe green one is the triangle after rotation around \n    (2,0)\n. In the second\nsample note that the polygon rotates \n    180\n degrees counter-clockwise or\nclockwise direction (it does not matter), because Hag's father makes sure that\nthe polygon is stable and his son does not trick him.\n\n",
