        "description": "Little Johnny has recently learned about set theory. Now he is studying binary\nrelations. You've probably heard the term \"equivalence relation\". These\nrelations are very important in many areas of mathematics. For example, the\nequality of the two numbers is an equivalence relation. A set \u03c1 of pairs (a,\nb) of elements of some set A is called a binary relation on set A. For two\nelements a and b of the set A we say that they are in relation \u03c1, if pair , in\nthis case we use a notation . Binary relation is equivalence relation, if: It\nis reflexive (for any a it is true that ); It is symmetric (for any a, b it is\ntrue that if , then ); It is transitive (if and , than ).Little Johnny is not\ncompletely a fool and he noticed that the first condition is not necessary!\nHere is his \"proof\": Take any two elements, a and b. If , then (according to\nproperty (2)), which means (according to property (3)). It's very simple,\nisn't it? However, you noticed that Johnny's \"proof\" is wrong, and decided to\nshow him a lot of examples that prove him wrong. Here's your task: count the\nnumber of binary relations over a set of size n such that they are symmetric,\ntransitive, but not an equivalence relations (i.e. they are not reflexive).\nSince their number may be very large (not 0, according to Little Johnny),\nprint the remainder of integer division of this number by 10^9 + 7. Input A\nsingle line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4000). Output In a single\nline print the answer to the problem modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input 1 Output\n1 Input 2 Output 3 Input 3 Output 10 Note If n = 1 there is only one such\nrelation \u2014 an empty one, i.e. . In other words, for a single element x of set\nA the following is hold: . If n = 2 there are three such relations. Let's\nassume that set A consists of two elements, x and y. Then the valid relations\nare , \u03c1 = (x, x), \u03c1 = (y, y). It is easy to see that the three listed\nbinary relations are symmetric and transitive relations, but they are not\nequivalence relations.\n\n",
