        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n. The score of \n    a\n is the\nMEX\n    ^\n    \u2020\n of \n    [a_1+a_2,a_2+a_3,\n    \u2026,a_n-1+a_n]\n. Find\nthe minimum score of \n    a\n if you are allowed to rearrange elements of\n\n    a\n in any order. Note that you are not required to construct the array\n\n    a\n that achieves the minimum score. \n    ^\n    \u2020\n The MEX (minimum\nexcluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not\nbelong to the array. For instance: The MEX of \n    [2,2,1]\n is \n    0\n,\nbecause \n    0\n does not belong to the array. The MEX of \n    [3,1,0,1]\n is\n\n    2\n, because \n    0\n and \n    1\n belong to the array, but \n    2\n does\nnot. The MEX of \n    [0,3,1,2]\n is \n    4\n because \n    0\n, \n    1\n, \n    2\n,\nand \n    3\n belong to the array, but \n    4\n does not. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test\ncase contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b710^5\n). The\nsecond line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n). It is guaranteed that the sum\nof \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case, output the minimum score of \n    a\n after rearranging the\nelements of \n    a\n in any order. Example Input 3 2 0 0 3 0 0 1 8 1 0 0 0 2 0\n3 0 Output 1 0 1 Note In the first test case, it is optimal to rearrange\n\n    a\n as \n    [0,0]\n, the score of this array is the MEX of \n    [0+0]=[0]\n,\nwhich is \n    1\n. In the second test case, it is optimal to rearrange \n    a\n\nas \n    [0,1,0]\n, the score of this array is the MEX of \n    [0+1,1+0]=[1,1]\n,\nwhich is \n    0\n.\n\n",
