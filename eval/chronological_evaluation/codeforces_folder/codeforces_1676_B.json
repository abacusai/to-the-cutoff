        "description": "There are \n    n\n boxes with different quantities of candies in each of them.\nThe \n    i\n-th box has \n    a_i\n candies inside. You also have \n    n\n friends\nthat you want to give the candies to, so you decided to give each friend a box\nof candies. But, you don't want any friends to get upset so you decided to eat\nsome (possibly none) candies from each box so that all boxes have the same\nquantity of candies in them. Note that you may eat a different number of\ncandies from different boxes and you cannot add candies to any of the boxes.\nWhat's the minimum total number of candies you have to eat to satisfy the\nrequirements? Input The first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case\ncontains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the number of boxes\nyou have. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^7\n) \u2014 the quantity of\ncandies in each box. Output For each test case, print a single integer\ndenoting the minimum number of candies you have to eat to satisfy the\nrequirements. Example Input 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 1000 1000 5 1000 1000 1000 10 1 2\n3 5 1 2 7 9 13 5 3 8 8 8 1 10000000 Output 10 4975 38 0 0 Note For the first\ntest case, you can eat \n    1\n candy from the second box, \n    2\n candies from\nthe third box, \n    3\n candies from the fourth box and \n    4\n candies from\nthe fifth box. Now the boxes have \n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n candies in them and\nyou ate \n    0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\n candies in total so the answer is\n\n    10\n. For the second test case, the best answer is obtained by making all\nboxes contain \n    5\n candies in them, thus eating \n    995 + 995 + 0 + 995 +\n    995 + 995 = 4975\n candies in total.\n\n",
