        "description": "\"Duel!\" Betting on the lovely princess Claris, the duel between Tokitsukaze\nand Quailty has started. There are \n    n\n cards in a row. Each card has two\nsides, one of which has color. At first, some of these cards are with color\nsides facing up and others are with color sides facing down. Then they take\nturns flipping cards, in which Tokitsukaze moves first. In each move, one\nshould choose exactly \n    k\n consecutive cards and flip them to the same\nside, which means to make their color sides all face up or all face down. If\nall the color sides of these \n    n\n cards face the same direction after one's\nmove, the one who takes this move will win. Princess Claris wants to know who\nwill win the game if Tokitsukaze and Quailty are so clever that they won't\nmake mistakes. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The second line contains a single string\nof length \n    n\n that only consists of \n    0\n and \n    1\n, representing the\nsituation of these \n    n\n cards, where the color side of the \n    i\n-th card\nfaces up if the \n    i\n-th character is \n    1\n, or otherwise, it faces down\nand the \n    i\n-th character is \n    0\n. Output Print \"once again\" (without\nquotes) if the total number of their moves can exceed \n    10^9\n, which is\nconsidered a draw. In other cases, print \"tokitsukaze\" (without quotes) if\nTokitsukaze will win, or \"quailty\" (without quotes) if Quailty will win. Note\nthat the output characters are case-sensitive, and any wrong spelling would be\nrejected. Examples Input 4 2 0101 Output quailty Input 6 1 010101 Output once\nagain Input 6 5 010101 Output tokitsukaze Input 4 1 0011 Output once again\nNote In the first example, no matter how Tokitsukaze moves, there would be\nthree cards with color sides facing the same direction after her move, and\nQuailty can flip the last card to this direction and win. In the second\nexample, no matter how Tokitsukaze moves, Quailty can choose the same card and\nflip back to the initial situation, which can allow the game to end in a draw.\nIn the third example, Tokitsukaze can win by flipping the leftmost five cards\nup or flipping the rightmost five cards down. The fourth example can be\nexplained in the same way as the second example does.\n\n",
