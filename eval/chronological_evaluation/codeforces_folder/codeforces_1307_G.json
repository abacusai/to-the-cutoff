        "description": "Farmer John is obsessed with making Bessie exercise more! Bessie is out\ngrazing on the farm, which consists of \n    n\n fields connected by \n    m\n\ndirected roads. Each road takes some time \n    w_i\n to cross. She is currently\nat field \n    1\n and will return to her home at field \n    n\n at the end of\nthe day. Farmer John has plans to increase the time it takes to cross certain\nroads. He can increase the time it takes to cross each road by a nonnegative\namount, but the total increase cannot exceed \n    x_i\n for the \n    i\n-th\nplan. Determine the maximum he can make the shortest path from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n for each of the \n    q\n independent plans. Input The first line\ncontains integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u00b7 (n-1)\n) \u2014 the number of fields and number of roads,\nrespectively. Each of the following \n    m\n lines contains \n    3\n integers,\n\n    u_i\n, \n    v_i\n, and \n    w_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 w_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n), meaning there is an road from field \n    u_i\n to\nfield \n    v_i\n that takes \n    w_i\n time to cross. It is guaranteed that\nthere exists a way to get to field \n    n\n from field \n    1\n. It is\nguaranteed that the graph does not contain self-loops or parallel edges. It is\npossible to have a road from \n    u\n to \n    v\n and a road from \n    v\n to\n\n    u\n. The next line contains a single integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n), the number of plans. Each of the following \n    q\n lines contains a\nsingle integer \n    x_i\n, the query (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 10^5\n). Output For\neach query, output the maximum Farmer John can make the shortest path if the\ntotal increase does not exceed \n    x_i\n. Your answer is considered correct if\nits absolute or relative error does not exceed \n    10^-6\n. Formally, let\nyour answer be \n    a\n, and the jury's answer be \n    b\n. Your answer is\naccepted if and only if \n    |a - b|/\n    max(1, |b|)\n    \u2264\n    10^-6\n.
