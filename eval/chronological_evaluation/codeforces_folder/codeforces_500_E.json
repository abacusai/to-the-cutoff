        "description": "Celebrating the new year, many people post videos of falling dominoes; Here's\na list of them: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=New+Years+Dominos\nUser ainta, who lives in a 2D world, is going to post a video as well. There\nare n dominoes on a 2D Cartesian plane. i-th domino (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) can be\nrepresented as a line segment which is parallel to the y-axis and whose length\nis li. The lower point of the domino is on the x-axis. Let's denote the\nx-coordinate of the i-th domino as pi. Dominoes are placed one after another,\nso p1 < p2 < ... < pn - 1 < pn holds. User ainta wants to take a video of\nfalling dominoes. To make dominoes fall, he can push a single domino to the\nright. Then, the domino will fall down drawing a circle-shaped orbit until the\nline segment totally overlaps with the x-axis. Also, if the s-th domino\ntouches the t-th domino while falling down, the t-th domino will also fall\ndown towards the right, following the same procedure above. Domino s touches\ndomino t if and only if the segment representing s and t intersects. See the\npicture above. If he pushes the leftmost domino to the right, it falls down,\ntouching dominoes (A), (B) and (C). As a result, dominoes (A), (B), (C) will\nalso fall towards the right. However, domino (D) won't be affected by pushing\nthe leftmost domino, but eventually it will fall because it is touched by\ndomino (C) for the first time. The picture above is an example of falling\ndominoes. Each red circle denotes a touch of two dominoes. User ainta has q\nplans of posting the video. j-th of them starts with pushing the xj-th domino,\nand lasts until the yj-th domino falls. But sometimes, it could be impossible\nto achieve such plan, so he has to lengthen some dominoes. It costs one dollar\nto increase the length of a single domino by 1. User ainta wants to know, for\neach plan, the minimum cost needed to achieve it. Plans are processed\nindependently, i. e. if domino's length is increased in some plan, it doesn't\naffect its length in other plans. Set of dominos that will fall except xj-th\ndomino and yj-th domino doesn't matter, but the initial push should be on\ndomino xj. Input The first line contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5)\u2014 the\nnumber of dominoes. Next n lines describe the dominoes. The i-th line (1 \u2264 i \u2264\nn) contains two space-separated integers pi, li (1 \u2264 pi, li \u2264 10^9)\u2014 the\nx-coordinate and the length of the i-th domino. It is guaranteed that p1 < p2\n< ... < pn - 1 < pn. The next line contains an integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5) \u2014\nthe number of plans. Next q lines describe the plans. The j-th line (1 \u2264 j \u2264\nq) contains two space-separated integers xj, yj (1 \u2264 xj < yj \u2264 n). It means\nthe j-th plan is, to push the xj-th domino, and shoot a video until the yj-th\ndomino falls. Output For each plan, print a line containing the minimum cost\nneeded to achieve it. If no cost is needed, print 0. Examples Input 6 1 5 3 3\n4 4 9 2 10 1 12 1 4 1 2 2 4 2 5 2 6 Output 0 1 1 2 Note Consider the example.\nThe dominoes are set like the picture below. Let's take a look at the 4th\nplan. To make the 6th domino fall by pushing the 2nd domino, the length of the\n3rd domino (whose x-coordinate is 4) should be increased by 1, and the 5th\ndomino (whose x-coordinate is 9) should be increased by 1 (other option is to\nincrease 4th domino instead of 5th also by 1). Then, the dominoes will fall\nlike in the picture below. Each cross denotes a touch between two dominoes.\n\n",
