        "description": "There are two sequences of colorful stones. The color of each stone is one of\nred, green, or blue. You are given two strings s and t. The i-th (1-based)\ncharacter of s represents the color of the i-th stone of the first sequence.\nSimilarly, the i-th (1-based) character of t represents the color of the i-th\nstone of the second sequence. If the character is \"R\", \"G\", or \"B\", the color\nof the corresponding stone is red, green, or blue, respectively. Initially\nSquirrel Liss is standing on the first stone of the first sequence and Cat\nVasya is standing on the first stone of the second sequence. You can perform\nthe following instructions zero or more times. Each instruction is one of the\nthree types: \"RED\", \"GREEN\", or \"BLUE\". After an instruction c, the animals\nstanding on stones whose colors are c will move one stone forward. For\nexample, if you perform an instruction \u00abRED\u00bb, the animals standing on red\nstones will move one stone forward. You are not allowed to perform\ninstructions that lead some animals out of the sequences. In other words, if\nsome animals are standing on the last stones, you can't perform the\ninstructions of the colors of those stones. A pair of positions (position of\nLiss, position of Vasya) is called a state. A state is called reachable if the\nstate is reachable by performing instructions zero or more times from the\ninitial state (1, 1). Calculate the number of distinct reachable states. Input\nThe input contains two lines. The first line contains the string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264\n10^6). The second line contains the string t (1 \u2264 |t| \u2264 10^6). The characters\nof each string will be one of \"R\", \"G\", or \"B\". Output Print the number of\ndistinct reachable states in a single line. Please, do not write the \nspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the\ncin, cout streams or the \nInput RGBB BRRBRR Output 19 Input RRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRR Output 8 Note In the\nfirst example, there are five reachable states: (1, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3,\n2), and (3, 3). For example, the state (3, 3) is reachable because if you\nperform instructions \"RED\", \"GREEN\", and \"BLUE\" in this order from the initial\nstate, the state will be (3, 3). The following picture shows how the\ninstructions work in this case.\n\n",
