        "description": "In an ICPC contest, balloons are distributed as follows: Whenever a team\nsolves a problem, that team gets a balloon. The first team to solve a problem\ngets an additional balloon. A contest has 26 problems, labelled\n\n    \n, \n    \n, \n    \n, ...,\n\n    \n. You are given the order of solved problems in the contest,\ndenoted as a string \n    s\n, where the \n    i\n-th character indicates that the\nproblem \n    s_i\n has been solved by some team. No team will solve the same\nproblem twice.Determine the total number of balloons that the teams received.\nNote that some problems may be solved by none of the teams. Input The first\nline of the input contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014\nthe number of testcases. The first line of each test case contains an integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the length of the string. The second\nline of each test case contains a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting\nof uppercase English letters, denoting the order of solved problems. Output\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the total number of balloons\nthat the teams received. Example Input 6 3 ABA 1 A 3 ORZ 5 BAAAA 4 BKPT 10\nCODEFORCES Output 5 2 6 7 8 17 Note In the first test case, \n    5\n balloons\nare given out: Problem \n    \n is solved. That team receives\n\n    2\n balloons: one because they solved the problem, an an additional one\nbecause they are the first team to solve problem \n    \n. Problem\n\n    \n is solved. That team receives \n    2\n balloons: one because\nthey solved the problem, an an additional one because they are the first team\nto solve problem \n    \n. Problem \n    \n is solved.\nThat team receives only \n    1\n balloon, because they solved the problem. Note\nthat they don't get an additional balloon because they are not the first team\nto solve problem \n    \n. The total number of balloons given out is\n\n    2+2+1=5\n.In the second test case, there is only one problem solved. The\nteam who solved it receives \n    2\n balloons: one because they solved the\nproblem, an an additional one because they are the first team to solve problem\n\n    \n.\n\n",
