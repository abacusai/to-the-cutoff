        "name": "Inna and Alarm Clock",
        "description": "Inna loves sleeping very much, so she needs n alarm clocks in total to wake\nup. Let's suppose that Inna's room is a 100 \u00d7 100 square with the lower left\ncorner at point (0, 0) and with the upper right corner at point (100, 100).\nThen the alarm clocks are points with integer coordinates in this square. The\nmorning has come. All n alarm clocks in Inna's room are ringing, so Inna wants\nto turn them off. For that Inna has come up with an amusing game: First Inna\nchooses a type of segments that she will use throughout the game. The segments\ncan be either vertical or horizontal. Then Inna makes multiple moves. In a\nsingle move, Inna can paint a segment of any length on the plane, she chooses\nits type at the beginning of the game (either vertical or horizontal), then\nall alarm clocks that are on this segment switch off. The game ends when all\nthe alarm clocks are switched off. Inna is very sleepy, so she wants to get\nthrough the alarm clocks as soon as possible. Help her, find the minimum\nnumber of moves in the game that she needs to turn off all the alarm clocks!\nInput The first line of the input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the\nnumber of the alarm clocks. The next n lines describe the clocks: the i-th\nline contains two integers xi, yi \u2014 the coordinates of the i-th alarm clock (0\n\u2264 xi, yi \u2264 100). Note that a single point in the room can contain any number\nof alarm clocks and the alarm clocks can lie on the sides of the square that\nrepresents the room. Output In a single line print a single integer \u2014 the\nminimum number of segments Inna will have to draw if she acts optimally.\nExamples Input 4 0 0 0 1 0 2 1 0 Output 2 Input 4 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 Output 2\nInput 4 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 Output 3 Note In the first sample, Inna first chooses\ntype \"vertical segments\", and then she makes segments with ends at : (0, 0),\n(0, 2); and, for example, (1, 0), (1, 1). If she paints horizontal segments,\nshe will need at least 3 segments. In the third sample it is important to note\nthat Inna doesn't have the right to change the type of the segments during the\ngame. That's why she will need 3 horizontal or 3 vertical segments to end the\ngame.\n\n",
