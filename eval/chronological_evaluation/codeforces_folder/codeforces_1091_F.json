        "description": "Bob is a duck. He wants to get to Alice's nest, so that those two can duck!\nDuck is the ultimate animal! (Image courtesy of See Bang) The journey can be\nrepresented as a straight line, consisting of \n    n\n segments. Bob is located\nto the left of the first segment, while Alice's nest is on the right of the\nlast segment. Each segment has a length in meters, and also terrain type:\ngrass, water or lava. Bob has three movement types: swimming, walking and\nflying. He can switch between them or change his direction at any point in\ntime (even when he is located at a non-integer coordinate), and doing so\ndoesn't require any extra time. Bob can swim only on the water, walk only on\nthe grass and fly over any terrain. Flying one meter takes \n    1\n second,\nswimming one meter takes \n    3\n seconds, and finally walking one meter takes\n\n    5\n seconds. Bob has a finite amount of energy, called stamina. Swimming\nand walking is relaxing for him, so he gains \n    1\n stamina for every meter\nhe walks or swims. On the other hand, flying is quite tiring, and he spends\n\n    1\n stamina for every meter flown. Staying in place does not influence his\nstamina at all. Of course, his stamina can never become negative. Initially,\nhis stamina is zero. What is the shortest possible time in which he can reach\nAlice's nest? Input The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of segments of terrain. The second line\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    l_1, l_2, \n    \u2026, l_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264\n    10^12\n). The \n    l_i\n represents the length of the \n    i\n-th terrain\nsegment in meters. The third line contains a string \n    s\n consisting of\n\n    n\n characters \"G\", \"W\", \"L\", representing Grass, Water and Lava,\nrespectively. It is guaranteed that the first segment is not Lava. Output\nOutput a single integer \n    t\n \u2014 the minimum time Bob needs to reach Alice.\nExamples Input 1 10 G Output 30 Input 2 10 10 WL Output 40 Input 2 1 2 WL\nOutput 8 Input 3 10 10 10 GLW Output 80 Note In the first sample, Bob first\nwalks \n    5\n meters in \n    25\n seconds. Then he flies the remaining \n    5\n\nmeters in \n    5\n seconds. In the second sample, Bob first swims \n    10\n\nmeters in \n    30\n seconds. Then he flies over the patch of lava for \n    10\n\nseconds. In the third sample, the water pond is much smaller. Bob first swims\nover the water pond, taking him \n    3\n seconds. However, he cannot fly over\nthe lava just yet, as he only has one stamina while he needs two. So he swims\nback for half a meter, and then half a meter forward, taking him \n    3\n\nseconds in total. Now he has \n    2\n stamina, so he can spend \n    2\n seconds\nflying over the lava. In the fourth sample, he walks for \n    50\n seconds,\nflies for \n    10\n seconds, swims for \n    15\n seconds, and finally flies for\n\n    5\n seconds.\n\n",
