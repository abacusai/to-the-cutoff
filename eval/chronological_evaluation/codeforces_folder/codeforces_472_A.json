        "description": "One way to create a task is to learn from math. You can generate some random\nmath statement or modify some theorems to get something new and build a new\ntask from that. For example, there is a statement called the \"Goldbach's\nconjecture\". It says: \"each even number no less than four can be expressed as\nthe sum of two primes\". Let's modify it. How about a statement like that:\n\"each integer no less than 12 can be expressed as the sum of two composite\nnumbers.\" Not like the Goldbach's conjecture, I can prove this theorem. You\nare given an integer n no less than 12, express it as a sum of two composite\nnumbers. Input The only line contains an integer n (12 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6). Output\nOutput two composite integers x and y (1 < x, y < n) such that x + y = n. If\nthere are multiple solutions, you can output any of them. Examples Input 12\nOutput 4 8 Input 15 Output 6 9 Input 23 Output 8 15 Input 1000000 Output\n500000 500000 Note In the first example, 12 = 4 + 8 and both 4, 8 are\ncomposite numbers. You can output \"6 6\" or \"8 4\" as well. In the second\nexample, 15 = 6 + 9. Note that you can't output \"1 14\" because 1 is not a\ncomposite number.\n\n",
