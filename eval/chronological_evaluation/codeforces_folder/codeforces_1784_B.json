        "description": "A cooperative game is played by \n    m\n people. In the game, there are\n\n    3m\n sheets of paper: \n    m\n sheets with letter 'w', \n    m\n sheets with\nletter 'i', and \n    m\n sheets with letter 'n'. Initially, each person is\ngiven three sheets (possibly with equal letters). The goal of the game is to\nallow each of the \n    m\n people to spell the word \"win\" using their sheets of\npaper. In other words, everyone should have one sheet with letter 'w', one\nsheet with letter 'i', and one sheet with letter 'n'. To achieve the goal,\npeople can make exchanges. Two people participate in each exchange. Both of\nthem choose exactly one sheet of paper from the three sheets they own and\nexchange it with each other. Find the shortest sequence of exchanges after\nwhich everyone has one 'w', one 'i', and one 'n'. Input Each test contains\nmultiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). The description of the test cases follows. The\nfirst line of each test case contains a single integer \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 m\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of people. The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    m\n\nlines contains a string \n    s_i\n of length \n    3\n consisting of lowercase\nEnglish letters 'w', 'i', and 'n', denoting the letters person \n    i\n has on\ntheir sheets of paper at the beginning of the game, in arbitrary order. Each\nof the letters 'w', 'i', and 'n' appears on the sheets of paper exactly\n\n    m\n times in total. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    m\n over all test\ncases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print a non-\nnegative integer \n    k\n \u2014 the smallest number of exchanges people need to\nmake everyone have one 'w', one 'i', and one 'n'. In each of the next \n    k\n\nlines print four tokens \n    a_1\n \n    c_1\n \n    a_2\n \n    c_2\n, describing\nthe exchanges in chronological order (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_1, a_2 \n    \u2264 m\n; \n    a_1\n    \n     a_2\n; \n    c_1, c_2\n are one of \n    \ud835\udea0, \n    \ud835\ude92,\n    \n    \ud835\ude97\n): person \n    a_1\n gives letter \n    c_1\n to person\n\n    a_2\n, while person \n    a_2\n gives letter \n    c_2\n to person \n    a_1\n\nat the same time. If there are multiple solutions, print any. Example Input 3\n2 nwi inw 3 inn nww wii 4 win www iii nnn Output 0 2 2 w 3 i 3 w 1 n 3 2 w 3 i\n2 w 4 n 3 i 4 n\n\n",
