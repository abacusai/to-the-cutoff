        "description": "Mainak has two positive integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n. Mainak finds a sequence\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n of \n    n\n positive integers interesting, if for\nall integers \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n), the bitwise XOR of all\nelements in \n    a\n which are strictly less than \n    a_i\n is \n    0\n.\nFormally if \n    p_i\n is the bitwise XOR of all elements in \n    a\n which are\nstrictly less than \n    a_i\n, then \n    a\n is an interesting sequence if\n\n    p_1 = p_2 = \n    \u2026 = p_n = 0\n. For example, sequences\n\n    [1,3,2,3,1,2,3]\n, \n    [4,4,4,4]\n, \n    [25]\n are interesting, whereas\n\n    [1,2,3,4]\n (\n    p_2 = 1 \n     0\n), \n    [4,1,1,2,4]\n (\n    p_1 = 1\n    \n    \u2295 1 \n    \u2295 2 = 2 \n     0\n), \n    [29,30,30]\n (\n    p_2 = 29 \n    \n    0\n) aren't interesting. Here \n    a \n    \u2295 b\n denotes bitwise XOR of\nintegers \n    a\n and \n    b\n. Find any interesting sequence \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (or report that there exists no such sequence) such that the\nsum of the elements in the sequence \n    a\n is equal to \n    m\n, i.e. \n    a_1 +\n    a_2 \n    \u2026 + a_n = m\n. As a reminder, the bitwise XOR of an empty sequence\nis considered to be \n    0\n. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first\nline and the only line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the length\nof the sequence and the sum of the elements. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test\ncase, if there exists some interesting sequence, output \"Yes\" on the first\nline, otherwise output \"No\". You may print each letter in any case (for\nexample, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as positive\nanswer). If the answer is \"Yes\", output \n    n\n positive integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    a_i \n    \u2265 1\n), forming an interesting sequence such\nthat \n    a_1 + a_2 \n    \u2026 + a_n = m\n. If there are multiple solutions,\noutput any. Example Input 4 1 3 6 12 2 1 3 6 Output Yes 3 Yes 1 3 2 2 3 1 No\nYes 2 2 2 Note In the first test case, \n    [3]\n is the only interesting\nsequence of length \n    1\n having sum \n    3\n. In the third test case, there\nis no sequence of length \n    2\n having sum of elements equal to \n    1\n, so\nthere is no such interesting sequence. In the fourth test case, \n    p_1 = p_2 =\n    p_3 = 0\n, because bitwise XOR of an empty sequence is \n    0\n.\n\n",
