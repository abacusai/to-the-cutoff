        "description": "One quite ordinary day Valera went to school (there's nowhere else he should\ngo on a week day). In a maths lesson his favorite teacher Ms. Evans told\nstudents about divisors. Despite the fact that Valera loved math, he didn't\nfind this particular topic interesting. Even more, it seemed so boring that he\nfell asleep in the middle of a lesson. And only a loud ringing of a school\nbell could interrupt his sweet dream. Of course, the valuable material and the\nteacher's explanations were lost. However, Valera will one way or another have\nto do the homework. As he does not know the new material absolutely, he cannot\ndo the job himself. That's why he asked you to help. You're his best friend\nafter all, you just cannot refuse to help. Valera's home task has only one\nproblem, which, though formulated in a very simple way, has not a trivial\nsolution. Its statement looks as follows: if we consider all positive integers\nin the interval [a;b] then it is required to count the amount of such numbers\nin this interval that their smallest divisor will be a certain integer k (you\ndo not have to consider divisor equal to one). In other words, you should\ncount the amount of such numbers from the interval [a;b], that are not\ndivisible by any number between 2 and k - 1 and yet are divisible by k. Input\nThe first and only line contains three positive integers a, b, k (1 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264\n2\u00b710^9, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 2\u00b710^9). Output Print on a single line the answer to the given\nproblem. Examples Input 1 10 2 Output 5 Input 12 23 3 Output 2 Input 6 19 5\nOutput 0 Note Comments to the samples from the statement: In the first sample\nthe answer is numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. In the second one \u2014 15, 21 In the third\none there are no such numbers.\n\n",
