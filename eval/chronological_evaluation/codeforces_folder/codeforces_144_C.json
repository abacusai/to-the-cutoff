        "description": "A string t is called an anagram of the string s, if it is possible to\nrearrange letters in t so that it is identical to the string s. For example,\nthe string \"aab\" is an anagram of the string \"aba\" and the string \"aaa\" is\nnot. The string t is called a substring of the string s if it can be read\nstarting from some position in the string s. For example, the string \"aba\" has\nsix substrings: \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\". You are given a string s,\nconsisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters \"?\". You are also given a\nstring p, consisting of lowercase Latin letters only. Let's assume that a\nstring is good if you can obtain an anagram of the string p from it, replacing\nthe \"?\" characters by Latin letters. Each \"?\" can be replaced by exactly one\ncharacter of the Latin alphabet. For example, if the string p = \u00ababa\u00bb, then\nthe string \"a??\" is good, and the string \u00ab?bc\u00bb is not. Your task is to find\nthe number of good substrings of the string s (identical substrings must be\ncounted in the answer several times). Input The first line is non-empty string\ns, consisting of no more than 10^5 lowercase Latin letters and characters \"?\".\nThe second line is non-empty string p, consisting of no more than 10^5\nlowercase Latin letters. Please note that the length of the string p can\nexceed the length of the string s. Output Print the single number representing\nthe number of good substrings of string s. Two substrings are considered\ndifferent in their positions of occurrence are different. Thus, if some string\noccurs several times, then it should be counted the same number of times.\nExamples Input bb??x??? aab Output 2 Input ab?c acb Output 2 Note Consider the\nfirst sample test. Here the string s has two good substrings: \"b??\" (after we\nreplace the question marks we get \"baa\"), \"???\" (after we replace the question\nmarks we get \"baa\"). Let's consider the second sample test. Here the string s\nhas two good substrings: \"ab?\" (\"?\" can be replaced by \"c\"), \"b?c\" (\"?\" can be\nreplaced by \"a\").\n\n",
