        "description": "The Berland Army is preparing for a large military parade. It is already\ndecided that the soldiers participating in it will be divided into \n    k\n\nrows, and all rows will contain the same number of soldiers. Of course, not\nevery arrangement of soldiers into \n    k\n rows is suitable. Heights of all\nsoldiers in the same row should not differ by more than \n    1\n. The height of\neach soldier is an integer between \n    1\n and \n    n\n. For each possible\nheight, you know the number of soldiers having this height. To conduct a\nparade, you have to choose the soldiers participating in it, and then arrange\nall of the chosen soldiers into \n    k\n rows so that both of the following\nconditions are met: each row has the same number of soldiers, no row contains\na pair of soldiers such that their heights differ by \n    2\n or more.\nCalculate the maximum number of soldiers who can participate in the parade.\nInput The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test\ncase begins with a line containing two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 30000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^12\n) \u2014 the number of\ndifferent heights of soldiers and the number of rows of soldiers in the\nparade, respectively. The second (and final) line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    c_1\n, \n    c_2\n, ..., \n    c_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264\n    10^12\n), where \n    c_i\n is the number of soldiers having height \n    i\n\nin the Berland Army. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases does not exceed \n    30000\n. Output For each test case, print one\ninteger \u2014 the maximum number of soldiers that can participate in the parade.\nExample Input 5 3 4 7 1 13 1 1 100 1 3 100 2 1 1000000000000 1000000000000 4 1\n10 2 11 1 Output 16 100 99 2000000000000 13 Note Explanations for the example\ntest cases: the heights of soldiers in the rows can be: \n    [3, 3, 3, 3]\n,\n\n    [1, 2, 1, 1]\n, \n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n, \n    [3, 3, 3, 3]\n (each list\nrepresents a row); all soldiers can march in the same row; \n    33\n soldiers\nwith height \n    1\n in each of \n    3\n rows; all soldiers can march in the\nsame row; all soldiers with height \n    2\n and \n    3\n can march in the same\nrow.\n\n",
