        "description": "Shohag has an integer sequence \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n. He can perform\nthe following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): Select any\npositive integer \n    k\n (it can be different in different operations). Choose\nany position in the sequence (possibly the beginning or end of the sequence,\nor in between any two elements) and insert \n    k\n into the sequence at this\nposition. This way, the sequence \n    a\n changes, and the next operation is\nperformed on this changed sequence. For example, if \n    a=[3,3,4]\n and he\nselects \n    k = 2\n, then after the operation he can obtain one of the\nsequences \n    [\n    2,3,3,4]\n, \n    [3,\n    2,3,4]\n,\n\n    [3,3,\n    2,4]\n, or \n    [3,3,4,\n    2]\n. Shohag wants\nthis sequence to satisfy the following condition: for each \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    |a|\n, \n    a_i \n    \u2264 i\n. Here, \n    |a|\n denotes the size of \n    a\n. Help\nhim to find the minimum number of operations that he has to perform to achieve\nthis goal. We can show that under the constraints of the problem it's always\npossible to achieve this goal in a finite number of operations. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the initial length of the\nsequence. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the elements of the\nsequence. Output For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum\nnumber of operations needed to perform to achieve the goal mentioned in the\nstatement. Example Input 4 3 1 3 4 5 1 2 5 7 4 1 1 3 69 6969 696969 Output 1 3\n0 696966 Note In the first test case, we have to perform at least one\noperation, as \n    a_2=3>2\n. We can perform the operation \n    [1, 3, 4]\n    \n    \u2192 [1, \n    2, 3, 4]\n (the newly inserted element is\nunderlined), now the condition is satisfied. In the second test case, Shohag\ncan perform the following operations: \n    [1, 2, 5, 7, 4] \n    \u2192 [1, 2,\n    \n    3, 5, 7, 4] \n    \u2192 [1, 2, 3, \n    4, 5, 7, 4]\n    \n    \u2192 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \n    3, 7, 4]\n. In the third test\ncase, the sequence already satisfies the condition.\n\n",
