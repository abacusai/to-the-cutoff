        "name": "An overnight dance in discotheque",
        "description": "The crowdedness of the discotheque would never stop our friends from having\nfun, but a bit more spaciousness won't hurt, will it? The discotheque can be\nseen as an infinite xy-plane, in which there are a total of n dancers. Once\nsomeone starts moving around, they will move only inside their own movement\nrange, which is a circular area Ci described by a center (xi, yi) and a radius\nri. No two ranges' borders have more than one common point, that is for every\npair (i, j) (1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n) either ranges Ci and Cj are disjoint, or one of\nthem is a subset of the other. Note that it's possible that two ranges'\nborders share a single common point, but no two dancers have exactly the same\nranges. Tsukihi, being one of them, defines the spaciousness to be the area\ncovered by an odd number of movement ranges of dancers who are moving. An\nexample is shown below, with shaded regions representing the spaciousness if\neveryone moves at the same time. But no one keeps moving for the whole night\nafter all, so the whole night's time is divided into two halves \u2014 before\nmidnight and after midnight. Every dancer moves around in one half, while\nsitting down with friends in the other. The spaciousness of two halves are\ncalculated separately and their sum should, of course, be as large as\npossible. The following figure shows an optimal solution to the example above.\nBy different plans of who dances in the first half and who does in the other,\ndifferent sums of spaciousness over two halves are achieved. You are to find\nthe largest achievable value of this sum. Input The first line of input\ncontains a positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the number of dancers. The\nfollowing n lines each describes a dancer: the i-th line among them contains\nthree space-separated integers xi, yi and ri ( - 10^6 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 10^6, 1 \u2264 ri\n\u2264 10^6), describing a circular movement range centered at (xi, yi) with radius\nri. Output Output one decimal number \u2014 the largest achievable sum of\nspaciousness over two halves of the night. The output is considered correct if\nit has a relative or absolute error of at most 10^-9. Formally, let your\nanswer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct if\n.
