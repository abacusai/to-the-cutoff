        "description": "Bob is decorating his kitchen, more precisely, the floor. He has found a prime\ncandidate for the tiles he will use. They come in a simple form factor \u2014 a\nsquare tile that is diagonally split into white and black part as depicted in\nthe figure below. The dimension of this tile is perfect for this kitchen, as\nhe will need exactly \n    w \n    \u00d7 h\n tiles without any scraps. That is, the\nwidth of the kitchen is \n    w\n tiles, and the height is \n    h\n tiles. As\neach tile can be rotated in one of four ways, he still needs to decide on how\nexactly he will tile the floor. There is a single aesthetic criterion that he\nwants to fulfil: two adjacent tiles must not share a colour on the edge \u2014 i.e.\none of the tiles must have a white colour on the shared border, and the second\none must be black. The picture on the left shows one valid tiling of a \n    3\n    \n    \u00d7 2\n kitchen. The picture on the right shows an invalid arrangement,\nas the bottom two tiles touch with their white parts. Find the number of\npossible tilings. As this number may be large, output its remainder when\ndivided by \n    998244353\n (a prime number). Input The only line contains two\nspace separated integers \n    w\n, \n    h\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 w,h \n    \u2264 1\n     000\n)\n\u2014 the width and height of the kitchen, measured in tiles. Output Output a\nsingle integer \n    n\n \u2014 the remainder of the number of tilings when divided\nby \n    998244353\n. Examples Input 2 2 Output 16 Input 2 4 Output 64\n\n",
