        "name": "Missile Silos",
        "description": "A country called Berland consists of n cities, numbered with integer numbers\nfrom 1 to n. Some of them are connected by bidirectional roads. Each road has\nsome length. There is a path from each city to any other one by these roads.\nAccording to some Super Duper Documents, Berland is protected by the Super\nDuper Missiles. The exact position of the Super Duper Secret Missile Silos is\nkept secret but Bob managed to get hold of the information. That information\nsays that all silos are located exactly at a distance l from the capital. The\ncapital is located in the city with number s. The documents give the formal\ndefinition: the Super Duper Secret Missile Silo is located at some place\n(which is either city or a point on a road) if and only if the shortest\ndistance from this place to the capital along the roads of the country equals\nexactly l. Bob wants to know how many missile silos are located in Berland to\nsell the information then to enemy spies. Help Bob. Input The first line\ncontains three integers n, m and s (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, , 1 \u2264 s \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of\ncities, the number of roads in the country and the number of the capital,\ncorrespondingly. Capital is the city no. s. Then m lines contain the\ndescriptions of roads. Each of them is described by three integers vi, ui, wi\n(1 \u2264 vi, ui \u2264 n, vi \u2260 ui, 1 \u2264 wi \u2264 1000), where vi, ui are numbers of the\ncities connected by this road and wi is its length. The last input line\ncontains integer l (0 \u2264 l \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the distance from the capital to the\nmissile silos. It is guaranteed that: between any two cities no more than one\nroad exists; each road connects two different cities; from each city there is\nat least one way to any other city by the roads. Output Print the single\nnumber \u2014 the number of Super Duper Secret Missile Silos that are located in\nBerland. Examples Input 4 6 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 2 3 1 2 4 1 3 4 1 1 4 2 2 Output 3\nInput 5 6 3 3 1 1 3 2 1 3 4 1 3 5 1 1 2 6 4 5 8 4 Output 3 Note In the first\nsample the silos are located in cities 3 and 4 and on road (1, 3) at a\ndistance 2 from city 1 (correspondingly, at a distance 1 from city 3). In the\nsecond sample one missile silo is located right in the middle of the road (1,\n2). Two more silos are on the road (4, 5) at a distance 3 from city 4 in the\ndirection to city 5 and at a distance 3 from city 5 to city 4.\n\n",
