        "description": "You are given a string \n    s\n. You have to determine whether it is possible\nto build the string \n    s\n out of strings aa, aaa, bb and/or bbb by\nconcatenating them. You can use the strings aa, aaa, bb and/or bbb any number\nof times and in any order. For example: aaaabbb can be built as aa \n    +\n aa\n\n    +\n bbb; bbaaaaabbb can be built as bb \n    +\n aaa \n    +\n aa \n    +\n bbb;\naaaaaa can be built as aa \n    +\n aa \n    +\n aa; abab cannot be built from aa,\naaa, bb and/or bbb. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of\none line containing the string \n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 |s| \n    \u2264 50\n),\nconsisting of characters a and/or b. Output For each test case, print YES if\nit is possible to build the string \n    s\n. Otherwise, print NO. You may print\neach letter in any case (for example, YES, yes, Yes will all be recognized as\npositive answer, NO, no and nO will all be recognized as negative answer).\nExample Input 8 aaaabbb bbaaaaabbb aaaaaa abab a b aaaab bbaaa Output YES YES\nYES NO NO NO NO YES Note The first four test cases of the example are\ndescribed in the statement.\n\n",
