        "description": "Polycarp is an organizer of a Berland ICPC regional event. There are \n    n\n\nuniversities in Berland numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Polycarp knows all\ncompetitive programmers in the region. There are \n    n\n students: the\n\n    i\n-th student is enrolled at a university \n    u_i\n and has a programming\nskill \n    s_i\n. Polycarp has to decide on the rules now. In particular, the\nnumber of members in the team. Polycarp knows that if he chooses the size of\nthe team to be some integer \n    k\n, each university will send their \n    k\n\nstrongest (with the highest programming skill \n    s\n) students in the first\nteam, the next \n    k\n strongest students in the second team and so on. If\nthere are fewer than \n    k\n students left, then the team can't be formed.\nNote that there might be universities that send zero teams. The strength of\nthe region is the total skill of the members of all present teams. If there\nare no teams present, then the strength is \n    0\n. Help Polycarp to find the\nstrength of the region for each choice of \n    k\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n.\nInput The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase contains a\nsingle integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\nuniversities and the number of students. The second line of each testcase\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    u_1, u_2, \n    \u2026, u_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i \n    \u2264\n    n\n) \u2014 the university the \n    i\n-th student is enrolled at. The third line\nof each testcase contains \n    n\n integers \n    s_1, s_2, \n    \u2026, s_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 s_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the programming skill of the \n    i\n-th student.\nThe sum of \n    n\n over all testcases doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n.\nOutput For each testcase print \n    n\n integers: the strength of the region \u2014\nthe total skill of the members of the present teams \u2014 for each choice of team\nsize \n    k\n.
