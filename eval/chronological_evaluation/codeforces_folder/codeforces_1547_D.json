        "description": "A sequence of non-negative integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n is called\ngrowing if for all \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n - 1\n all ones (of binary\nrepresentation) in \n    a_i\n are in the places of ones (of binary\nrepresentation) in \n    a_i + 1\n (in other words, \n    a_i \n     \n    &\n      a_i +\n    1 = a_i\n, where \n    &\n denotes bitwise AND). If \n    n = 1\n then the\nsequence is considered growing as well. For example, the following four\nsequences are growing: \n    [2, 3, 15, 175]\n \u2014 in binary it's \n    [10_2, 11_2,\n    1111_2, 10101111_2]\n; \n    [5]\n \u2014 in binary it's \n    [101_2]\n; \n    [1, 3, 7,\n    15]\n \u2014 in binary it's \n    [1_2, 11_2, 111_2, 1111_2]\n; \n    [0, 0, 0]\n \u2014 in\nbinary it's \n    [0_2, 0_2, 0_2]\n. The following three sequences are non-\ngrowing: \n    [3, 4, 5]\n \u2014 in binary it's \n    [11_2, 100_2, 101_2]\n; \n    [5,\n    4, 3]\n \u2014 in binary it's \n    [101_2, 100_2, 011_2]\n; \n    [1, 2, 4, 8]\n \u2014 in\nbinary it's \n    [0001_2, 0010_2, 0100_2, 1000_2]\n. Consider two sequences of\nnon-negative integers \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n\n and \n    y_1, y_2, \n    \u2026,\n    y_n\n. Let's call this pair of sequences co-growing if the sequence \n    x_1\n    \n    \u2295 y_1, x_2 \n    \u2295 y_2, \n    \u2026, x_n \n    \u2295 y_n\n is growing where\n\n    \u2295\n denotes bitwise XOR. You are given a sequence of integers\n\n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n\n. Find the lexicographically minimal sequence\n\n    y_1, y_2, \n    \u2026, y_n\n such that sequences \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n are\nco-growing. The sequence \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n is lexicographically\nsmaller than the sequence \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n if there exists \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n such that \n    a_i = b_i\n for any \n    1 \n    \u2264 i < k\n but\n\n    a_k < b_k\n. Input The first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of each test\ncase contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014\nlength of the sequence \n    x_i\n. The second line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x_i < 2^30\n) \u2014 elements of the\nsequence \n    x_i\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n overall all test\ncases doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print\n\n    n\n integers \n    y_1, y_2, \n    \u2026, y_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 y_i < 2^30\n) \u2014\nlexicographically minimal sequence such that such that it's co-growing with\ngiven sequence \n    x_i\n.
