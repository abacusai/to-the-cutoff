        "name": "Mr. Kitayuta, the Treasure Hunter",
        "description": "The Shuseki Islands are an archipelago of 30001 small islands in the Yutampo\nSea. The islands are evenly spaced along a line, numbered from 0 to 30000 from\nthe west to the east. These islands are known to contain many treasures. There\nare n gems in the Shuseki Islands in total, and the i-th gem is located on\nisland pi. Mr. Kitayuta has just arrived at island 0. With his great jumping\nability, he will repeatedly perform jumps between islands to the east\naccording to the following process: First, he will jump from island 0 to\nisland d. After that, he will continue jumping according to the following\nrule. Let l be the length of the previous jump, that is, if his previous jump\nwas from island prev to island cur, let l = cur - prev. He will perform a jump\nof length l - 1, l or l + 1 to the east. That is, he will jump to island (cur\n+ l - 1), (cur + l) or (cur + l + 1) (if they exist). The length of a jump\nmust be positive, that is, he cannot perform a jump of length 0 when l = 1. If\nthere is no valid destination, he will stop jumping. Mr. Kitayuta will collect\nthe gems on the islands visited during the process. Find the maximum number of\ngems that he can collect. Input The first line of the input contains two\nspace-separated integers n and d (1 \u2264 n, d \u2264 30000), denoting the number of\nthe gems in the Shuseki Islands and the length of the Mr. Kitayuta's first\njump, respectively. The next n lines describe the location of the gems. The\ni-th of them (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) contains a integer pi (d \u2264 p1 \u2264 p2 \u2264 ... \u2264 pn \u2264\n30000), denoting the number of the island that contains the i-th gem. Output\nPrint the maximum number of gems that Mr. Kitayuta can collect.
