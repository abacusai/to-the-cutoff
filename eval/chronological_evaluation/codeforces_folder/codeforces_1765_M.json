        "description": "You are given an integer \n    n\n. Your task is to find two positive (greater\nthan \n    0\n) integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n such that \n    a+b=n\n and the least\ncommon multiple (LCM) of \n    a\n and \n    b\n is the minimum among all possible\nvalues of \n    a\n and \n    b\n. If there are multiple answers, you can print\nany of them. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test\ncase contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Output\nFor each test case, print two positive integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n \u2014 the\nanswer to the problem. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of\nthem. Example Input 4 2 9 5 10 Output 1 1 3 6 1 4 5 5 Note In the second\nexample, there are \n    8\n possible pairs of \n    a\n and \n    b\n: \n    a = 1\n,\n\n    b = 8\n, \n    LCM(1, 8) = 8\n; \n    a = 2\n, \n    b = 7\n, \n    LCM(2, 7) =\n    14\n; \n    a = 3\n, \n    b = 6\n, \n    LCM(3, 6) = 6\n; \n    a = 4\n, \n    b =\n    5\n, \n    LCM(4, 5) = 20\n; \n    a = 5\n, \n    b = 4\n, \n    LCM(5, 4) = 20\n;\n\n    a = 6\n, \n    b = 3\n, \n    LCM(6, 3) = 6\n; \n    a = 7\n, \n    b = 2\n,\n\n    LCM(7, 2) = 14\n; \n    a = 8\n, \n    b = 1\n, \n    LCM(8, 1) = 8\n. In the\nthird example, there are \n    5\n possible pairs of \n    a\n and \n    b\n: \n    a =\n    1\n, \n    b = 4\n, \n    LCM(1, 4) = 4\n; \n    a = 2\n, \n    b = 3\n, \n    LCM(2, 3)\n    = 6\n; \n    a = 3\n, \n    b = 2\n, \n    LCM(3, 2) = 6\n; \n    a = 4\n, \n    b =\n    1\n, \n    LCM(4, 1) = 4\n.\n\n",
