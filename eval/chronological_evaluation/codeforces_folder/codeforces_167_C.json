        "description": "In some country live wizards. They love playing with numbers. The blackboard\nhas two numbers written on it \u2014 a and b. The order of the numbers is not\nimportant. Let's consider a \u2264 b for the sake of definiteness. The players can\ncast one of the two spells in turns: Replace b with b - a^k. Number k can be\nchosen by the player, considering the limitations that k > 0 and b - a^k \u2265 0.\nNumber k is chosen independently each time an active player casts a spell.\nReplace b with b mod a. If a > b, similar moves are possible. If at least one\nof the numbers equals zero, a player can't make a move, because taking a\nremainder modulo zero is considered somewhat uncivilized, and it is far too\nboring to subtract a zero. The player who cannot make a move, loses. To\nperform well in the magic totalizator, you need to learn to quickly determine\nwhich player wins, if both wizards play optimally: the one that moves first or\nthe one that moves second. Input The first line contains a single integer t \u2014\nthe number of input data sets (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4). Each of the next t lines\ncontains two integers a, b (0 \u2264 a, b \u2264 10^18). The numbers are separated by a\nspace. Please do not use the \nintegers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the \nspecificator. Output For any of the t input sets print \"First\" (without the\nquotes) if the player who moves first wins. Print \"Second\" (without the\nquotes) if the player who moves second wins. Print the answers to different\ndata sets on different lines in the order in which they are given in the\ninput. Examples Input 4 10 21 31 10 0 1 10 30 Output First Second Second First\nNote In the first sample, the first player should go to (11,10). Then, after a\nsingle move of the second player to (1,10), he will take 10 modulo 1 and win.\nIn the second sample the first player has two moves to (1,10) and (21,10).\nAfter both moves the second player can win. In the third sample, the first\nplayer has no moves. In the fourth sample, the first player wins in one move,\ntaking 30 modulo 10.\n\n",
