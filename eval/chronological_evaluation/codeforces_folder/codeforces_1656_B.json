        "description": "You are given a list of \n    n\n integers. You can perform the following\noperation: you choose an element \n    x\n from the list, erase \n    x\n from the\nlist, and subtract the value of \n    x\n from all the remaining elements. Thus,\nin one operation, the length of the list is decreased by exactly \n    1\n.\nGiven an integer \n    k\n (\n    k>0\n), find if there is some sequence of\n\n    n-1\n operations such that, after applying the operations, the only\nremaining element of the list is equal to \n    k\n. Input The input consists of\nmultiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test\ncases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n\nand \n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n), the number of integers in the list, and the target value,\nrespectively. The second line of each test case contains the \n    n\n integers\nof the list \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases is not\ngreater that \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print YES if you\ncan achieve \n    k\n with a sequence of \n    n-1\n operations. Otherwise, print\nNO. You may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\",\n\"yEs\" will all be recognized as a positive answer). Example Input 4 4 5 4 2 2\n7 5 4 1 9 1 3 4 2 17 17 0 2 17 18 18 Output YES NO YES NO Note In the first\nexample we have the list \n    4, 2, 2, 7\n, and we have the target\n\n    k = 5\n. One way to achieve it is the following: first we choose the third\nelement, obtaining the list \n    2, 0, 5\n. Next we choose the first\nelement, obtaining the list \n    -2, 3\n. Finally, we choose the\nfirst element, obtaining the list \n    5\n.\n\n",
