        "description": "There are \n    n\n districts in the town, the \n    i\n-th district belongs to\nthe \n    a_i\n-th bandit gang. Initially, no districts are connected to each\nother. You are the mayor of the city and want to build \n    n-1\n two-way roads\nto connect all districts (two districts can be connected directly or through\nother connected districts). If two districts belonging to the same gang are\nconnected directly with a road, this gang will revolt. You don't want this so\nyour task is to build \n    n-1\n two-way roads in such a way that all districts\nare reachable from each other (possibly, using intermediate districts) and\neach pair of directly connected districts belong to different gangs, or\ndetermine that it is impossible to build \n    n-1\n roads to satisfy all the\nconditions. You have to answer \n    t\n independent test cases. Input The first\nline of the input contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 500\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of\nthe test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of districts. The second line of the test case contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), where\n\n    a_i\n is the gang the \n    i\n-th district belongs to. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n does not exceed \n    5000\n (\n    \u2211 n \n    \u2264\n    5000\n). Output For each test case, print: NO on the only line if it is\nimpossible to connect all districts satisfying the conditions from the problem\nstatement. YES on the first line and \n    n-1\n roads on the next \n    n-1\n\nlines. Each road should be presented as a pair of integers \n    x_i\n and\n\n    y_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i, y_i \n    \u2264 n; x_i \n     y_i\n), where \n    x_i\n and\n\n    y_i\n are two districts the \n    i\n-th road connects. For each road\n\n    i\n, the condition \n    a[x_i] \n     a[y_i]\n should be satisfied. Also,\nall districts should be reachable from each other (possibly, using\nintermediate districts).
