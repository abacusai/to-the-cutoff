        "description": "There is a prison that can be represented as a rectangular matrix with \n    n\n\nrows and \n    m\n columns. Therefore, there are \n    n \n    \u00b7 m\n prison cells.\nThere are also \n    n \n    \u00b7 m\n prisoners, one in each prison cell. Let's\ndenote the cell in the \n    i\n-th row and the \n    j\n-th column as \n    (i,\n    j)\n. There's a secret tunnel in the cell \n    (r, c)\n, that the prisoners\nwill use to escape! However, to avoid the risk of getting caught, they will\nescape at night. Before the night, every prisoner is in his own cell. When\nnight comes, they can start moving to adjacent cells. Formally, in one second,\na prisoner located in cell \n    (i, j)\n can move to cells \n    ( i - 1 , j )\n\n, \n    ( i + 1 , j )\n , \n    ( i , j - 1 )\n , or \n    ( i , j + 1 )\n, as long\nas the target cell is inside the prison. They can also choose to stay in cell\n\n    (i, j)\n. The prisoners want to know the minimum number of seconds needed\nso that every prisoner can arrive to cell \n    ( r , c )\n if they move\noptimally. Note that there can be any number of prisoners in the same cell at\nthe same time. Input The first line contains an integer \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4)\n, the number of test cases. Each of the next \n    t\n lines\ncontains four space-separated integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, \n    r\n, \n    c\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 c \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^9\n).\nOutput Print \n    t\n lines, the answers for each test case.
