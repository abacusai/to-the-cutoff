        "description": "You are given an integer \n    n\n. Find a sequence of \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n for all \n    i\n\nand \n    \n\n    a_1 \n    \u2295 a_2 \n    \u2295\n    \u2026\n    \u2295 a_n = \n    a_1 + a_2 +\n    \n    \u2026 + a_n/n,\n\n    \n where \n    \u2295\n represents the bitwise XOR. It\ncan be proven that there exists a sequence of integers that satisfies all the\nconditions above. Input The first line of input contains \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first and only line of each\ntest case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of the sequence you have to find. The sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output \n    n\n\nspace-separated integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n satisfying the\nconditions in the statement. If there are several possible answers, you can\noutput any of them. Example Input 3 1 4 3 Output 69 13 2 8 1 7 7 7 Note In the\nfirst test case, \n    69 = \n    69/1 = 69\n. In the second test case,\n\n    13 \n    \u2295 2 \n    \u2295 8 \n    \u2295 1 = \n    13 + 2 + 8 + 1/4 = 6\n.\n\n",
