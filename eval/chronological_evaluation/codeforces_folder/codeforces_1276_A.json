        "description": "You are given a non-empty string \n    s=s_1s_2\n    \u2026 s_n\n, which consists\nonly of lowercase Latin letters. Polycarp does not like a string if it\ncontains at least one string \"one\" or at least one string \"two\" (or both at\nthe same time) as a substring. In other words, Polycarp does not like the\nstring \n    s\n if there is an integer \n    j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 j \n    \u2264 n-2\n),\nthat \n    s_js_j+1s_j+2=\n\"one\" or \n    s_js_j+1s_j+2=\n\"two\". For\nexample: Polycarp does not like strings \"oneee\", \"ontwow\", \"twone\" and\n\"oneonetwo\" (they all have at least one substring \"one\" or \"two\"), Polycarp\nlikes strings \"oonnee\", \"twwwo\" and \"twnoe\" (they have no substrings \"one\" and\n\"two\"). Polycarp wants to select a certain set of indices (positions) and\nremove all letters on these positions. All removals are made at the same time.\nFor example, if the string looks like \n    s=\n\"onetwone\", then if Polycarp\nselects two indices \n    3\n and \n    6\n, then \"onetwone\" will be selected and\nthe result is \"ontwne\". What is the minimum number of indices (positions) that\nPolycarp needs to select to make the string liked? What should these positions\nbe? Input The first line of the input contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Next, the test cases\nare given. Each test case consists of one non-empty string \n    s\n. Its length\ndoes not exceed \n    1.5\n    \u00b710^5\n. The string \n    s\n consists only of\nlowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of all lines\nfor all input data in the test does not exceed \n    1.5\n    \u00b710^6\n. Output\nPrint an answer for each test case in the input in order of their appearance.\nThe first line of each answer should contain \n    r\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264\n    |s|\n) \u2014 the required minimum number of positions to be removed, where\n\n    |s|\n is the length of the given line. The second line of each answer\nshould contain \n    r\n different integers \u2014 the indices themselves for removal\nin any order. Indices are numbered from left to right from \n    1\n to the\nlength of the string. If \n    r=0\n, then the second line can be skipped (or\nyou can print empty). If there are several answers, print any of them.\nExamples Input 4 onetwone testme oneoneone twotwo Output 2 6 3 0 3 4 1 7 2 1 4\nInput 10 onetwonetwooneooonetwooo two one twooooo ttttwo ttwwoo ooone onnne\noneeeee oneeeeeeetwooooo Output 6 18 11 12 1 6 21 1 1 1 3 1 2 1 6 0 1 4 0 1 1\n2 1 11 Note In the first example, answers are: \"onetwone\", \"testme\" \u2014 Polycarp\nlikes it, there is nothing to remove, \"oneoneone\", \"twotwo\". In the second\nexample, answers are: \"onetwonetwooneooonetwooo\", \"two\", \"one\", \"twooooo\",\n\"ttttwo\", \"ttwwoo\" \u2014 Polycarp likes it, there is nothing to remove, \"ooone\",\n\"onnne\" \u2014 Polycarp likes it, there is nothing to remove, \"oneeeee\",\n\"oneeeeeeetwooooo\".\n\n",
