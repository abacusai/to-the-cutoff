        "description": "Let's define a number ebne (even but not even) if and only if its sum of\ndigits is divisible by \n    2\n but the number itself is not divisible by\n\n    2\n. For example, \n    13\n, \n    1227\n, \n    185217\n are ebne numbers,\nwhile \n    12\n, \n    2\n, \n    177013\n, \n    265918\n are not. If you're still\nunsure what ebne numbers are, you can look at the sample notes for more\nclarification. You are given a non-negative integer \n    s\n, consisting of\n\n    n\n digits. You can delete some digits (they are not necessary\nconsecutive/successive) to make the given number ebne. You cannot change the\norder of the digits, that is, after deleting the digits the remaining digits\ncollapse. The resulting number shouldn't contain leading zeros. You can delete\nany number of digits between \n    0\n (do not delete any digits at all) and\n\n    n-1\n. For example, if you are given \n    s=\n222373204424185217171912 then\none of possible ways to make it ebne is: 222373204424185217171912\n\n    \u2192\n 2237344218521717191. The sum of digits of\n2237344218521717191 is equal to \n    70\n and is divisible by \n    2\n, but\nnumber itself is not divisible by \n    2\n: it means that the resulting number\nis ebne. Find any resulting number that is ebne. If it's impossible to create\nan ebne number from the given number report about it. Input The input consists\nof multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test\ncases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3000\n) \u2014 the number of digits in the original\nnumber. The second line of each test case contains a non-negative integer\nnumber \n    s\n, consisting of \n    n\n digits. It is guaranteed that \n    s\n\ndoes not contain leading zeros and the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does\nnot exceed \n    3000\n. Output For each test case given in the input print the\nanswer in the following format: If it is impossible to create an ebne number,\nprint \"-1\" (without quotes); Otherwise, print the resulting number after\ndeleting some, possibly zero, but not all digits. This number should be ebne.\nIf there are multiple answers, you can print any of them. Note that answers\nwith leading zeros or empty strings are not accepted. It's not necessary to\nminimize or maximize the number of deleted digits. Example Input 4 4 1227 1 0\n6 177013 24 222373204424185217171912 Output 1227 -1 17703 2237344218521717191\nNote In the first test case of the example, \n    1227\n is already an ebne\nnumber (as \n    1 + 2 + 2 + 7 = 12\n, \n    12\n is divisible by \n    2\n, while\nin the same time, \n    1227\n is not divisible by \n    2\n) so we don't need to\ndelete any digits. Answers such as \n    127\n and \n    17\n will also be\naccepted. In the second test case of the example, it is clearly impossible to\ncreate an ebne number from the given number. In the third test case of the\nexample, there are many ebne numbers we can obtain by deleting, for example,\n\n    1\n digit such as \n    17703\n, \n    77013\n or \n    17013\n. Answers such as\n\n    1701\n or \n    770\n will not be accepted as they are not ebne numbers.\nAnswer \n    013\n will not be accepted as it contains leading zeroes.\nExplanation: \n    1 + 7 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 18\n. As \n    18\n is divisible by \n    2\n\nwhile \n    17703\n is not divisible by \n    2\n, we can see that \n    17703\n is\nan ebne number. Same with \n    77013\n and \n    17013\n; \n    1 + 7 + 0 + 1 =\n    9\n. Because \n    9\n is not divisible by \n    2\n, \n    1701\n is not an ebne\nnumber; \n    7 + 7 + 0 = 14\n. This time, \n    14\n is divisible by \n    2\n but\n\n    770\n is also divisible by \n    2\n, therefore, \n    770\n is not an ebne\nnumber.In the last test case of the example, one of many other possible\nanswers is given. Another possible answer is: 222373204424185217171912\n\n    \u2192\n 22237320442418521717191 (delete the last digit).\n\n",
