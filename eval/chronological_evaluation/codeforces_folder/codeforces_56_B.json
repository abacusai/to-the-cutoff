        "description": "Vasya collects coins: he has exactly one coin for every year from 1 to n.\nNaturally, Vasya keeps all the coins in his collection in the order in which\nthey were released. Once Vasya's younger brother made a change \u2014 he took all\nthe coins whose release year dated from l to r inclusively and put them in the\nreverse order. That is, he took a certain segment [l, r] and reversed it. At\nthat the segment's endpoints did not coincide. For example, if n = 8, then\ninitially Vasya's coins were kept in the order 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. If Vasya's\nyounger brother chose the segment [2, 6], then after the reversal the coin\norder will change to 1 6 5 4 3 2 7 8. Vasya suspects that someone else could\nhave spoilt the permutation after his brother. Help him to find that out.\nCheck if the given permutation can be obtained from the permutation 1 2 ... n\nusing exactly one segment reversal. If it is possible, find the segment\nitself. Input The first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) which is the\nnumber of coins in Vasya's collection. The second line contains space-\nseparated n integers which are the spoilt sequence of coins. It is guaranteed\nthat the given sequence is a permutation, i.e. it contains only integers from\n1 to n, and every number is used exactly 1 time. Output If it is impossible to\nobtain the given permutation from the original one in exactly one action,\nprint 0 0. Otherwise, print two numbers l r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) which are the\nendpoints of the segment that needs to be reversed to obtain from permutation\n1 2 ... n the given one. Examples Input 8 1 6 5 4 3 2 7 8 Output 2 6 Input 4 2\n3 4 1 Output 0 0 Input 4 1 2 3 4 Output 0 0\n\n",
