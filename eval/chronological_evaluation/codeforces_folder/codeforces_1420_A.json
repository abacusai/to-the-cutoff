        "description": "For god's sake, you're boxes with legs! It is literally your only purpose!\nWalking onto buttons! How can you not do the one thing you were designed\nfor?Oh, that's funny, is it? Oh it's funny? Because we've been at this for\ntwelve hours and you haven't solved it either, so I don't know why you're\nlaughing. You've got one hour! Solve it! Wheatley decided to try to make a\ntest chamber. He made a nice test chamber, but there was only one detail\nabsent \u2014 cubes. For completing the chamber Wheatley needs \n    n\n cubes.\n\n    i\n-th cube has a volume \n    a_i\n. Wheatley has to place cubes in such a\nway that they would be sorted in a non-decreasing order by their volume.\nFormally, for each \n    i>1\n, \n    a_i-1\n    \u2264 a_i\n must hold. To achieve\nhis goal, Wheatley can exchange two neighbouring cubes. It means that for any\n\n    i>1\n you can exchange cubes on positions \n    i-1\n and \n    i\n. But there\nis a problem: Wheatley is very impatient. If Wheatley needs more than\n\n    n \n    \u00b7 (n-1)/2-1\n exchange operations, he won't do this\nboring work. Wheatly wants to know: can cubes be sorted under this conditions?\nInput Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains one\npositive integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n), denoting the number of\ntest cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test\ncase contains one positive integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7\n    10^4\n) \u2014 number of cubes. The second line contains \n    n\n positive integers\n\n    a_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 volumes of cubes. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output\nFor each test case, print a word in a single line: \"YES\" (without quotation\nmarks) if the cubes can be sorted and \"NO\" (without quotation marks)\notherwise. Example Input 3 5 5 3 2 1 4 6 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 Output YES YES NO\nNote In the first test case it is possible to sort all the cubes in \n    7\n\nexchanges. In the second test case the cubes are already sorted. In the third\ntest case we can make \n    0\n exchanges, but the cubes are not sorted yet, so\nthe answer is \"NO\".\n\n",
