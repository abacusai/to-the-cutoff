        "description": "A school has to decide on its team for an international quiz. There are\n\n    n\n students in the school. We can describe the students using an array\n\n    a\n where \n    a_i\n is the smartness of the \n    i\n-th (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    n\n) student. There are \n    m\n topics \n    1, 2, 3, \n    \u2026, m\n from which\nthe quiz questions will be formed. The \n    i\n-th student is considered\nproficient in a topic \n    T\n if \n    (a_i \n     T) = 0\n. Otherwise, he is a\nrookie in that topic. We say that a team of students is collectively\nproficient in all the topics if for every topic there is a member of the team\nproficient in this topic. Find a team that is collectively proficient in all\nthe topics such that the maximum difference between the smartness of any two\nstudents in that team is minimized. Output this difference. Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). The description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n,m \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^5\n). It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    10^5\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    m\n over all test cases does\nnot exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print the answer on a new\nline. If there is no solution, output \n    -1\n. Example Input 3 2 4 3 7 4 2 3\n7 2 9 5 7 6 4 3 5 7 Output -1 0 3 Note In the first test case, we have\nparticipants with smartnesses \n    3\n and \n    7\n, and \n    m = 4\n. Thus,\nthere is no student with smartness divisible by \n    2\n. Since \n    2 \n    \u2264\n    m\n, there is no way to choose a team. In the second test case, we can select\nthe participant with smartness \n    2\n to be the only one on the team. This\nway the team will be collectively proficient in both topics \n    1\n and\n\n    2\n. In the third test case, consider the team with participants of\nsmartnesses \n    4, 5, 6, 7\n. This way the team will be collectively\nproficient in all topics \n    1, 2, \n    \u2026, 7\n.\n\n",
