        "description": "Vlad, like everyone else, loves to sleep very much. Every day Vlad has to do\n\n    n\n things, each at a certain time. For each of these things, he has an\nalarm clock set, the \n    i\n-th of them is triggered on \n    h_i\n hours\n\n    m_i\n minutes every day (\n    0 \n    \u2264 h_i < 24, 0 \n    \u2264 m_i < 60\n). Vlad\nuses the \n    24\n-hour time format, so after \n    h=12, m=59\n comes \n    h=13,\n    m=0\n and after \n    h=23, m=59\n comes \n    h=0, m=0\n. This time Vlad went to\nbed at \n    H\n hours \n    M\n minutes (\n    0 \n    \u2264 H < 24, 0 \n    \u2264 M < 60\n)\nand asks you to answer: how much he will be able to sleep until the next alarm\nclock. If any alarm clock rings at the time when he went to bed, then he will\nsleep for a period of time of length \n    0\n. Input The first line of input\ndata contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases in the test. The first line of the case contains three integers\n\n    n\n, \n    H\n and \n    M\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10, 0 \n    \u2264 H < 24, 0 \n    \u2264 M\n    < 60\n) \u2014 the number of alarms and the time Vlad went to bed. The following\n\n    n\n lines contain two numbers each \n    h_i\n and \n    m_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 h_i\n    < 24, 0 \n    \u2264 m_i < 60\n) \u2014 the time of the \n    i\n alarm. It is acceptable\nthat two or more alarms will trigger at the same time. Numbers describing time\ndo not contain leading zeros. Output Output \n    t\n lines, each containing the\nanswer to the corresponding test case. As an answer, output two numbers \u2014 the\nnumber of hours and minutes that Vlad will sleep, respectively. If any alarm\nclock rings at the time when he went to bed, the answer will be 0 0. Example\nInput 3 1 6 13 8 0 3 6 0 12 30 14 45 6 0 2 23 35 20 15 10 30 Output 1 47 0 0\n10 55\n\n",
