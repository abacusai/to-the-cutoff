        "description": "Polycarp is an experienced participant in Codehorses programming contests. Now\nhe wants to become a problemsetter. He sent to the coordinator a set of n\nproblems. Each problem has it's quality, the quality of the i-th problem is ai\n(ai can be positive, negative or equal to zero). The problems are ordered by\nexpected difficulty, but the difficulty is not related to the quality in any\nway. The easiest problem has index 1, the hardest problem has index n. The\ncoordinator's mood is equal to q now. After reading a problem, the mood\nchanges by it's quality. It means that after the coordinator reads a problem\nwith quality b, the value b is added to his mood. The coordinator always reads\nproblems one by one from the easiest to the hardest, it's impossible to change\nthe order of the problems. If after reading some problem the coordinator's\nmood becomes negative, he immediately stops reading and rejects the\nproblemset. Polycarp wants to remove the minimum number of problems from his\nproblemset to make the coordinator's mood non-negative at any moment of time.\nPolycarp is not sure about the current coordinator's mood, but he has m\nguesses \"the current coordinator's mood q = bi\". For each of m guesses, find\nthe minimum number of problems Polycarp needs to remove so that the\ncoordinator's mood will always be greater or equal to 0 while he reads\nproblems from the easiest of the remaining problems to the hardest. Input The\nfirst line of input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 750, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 200\n000) \u2014 the number of problems in the problemset and the number of guesses\nabout the current coordinator's mood. The second line of input contains n\nintegers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 10^9 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the qualities of the problems\nin order of increasing difficulty. The third line of input contains m integers\nb1, b2, ..., bm (0 \u2264 bi \u2264 10^15) \u2014 the guesses of the current coordinator's\nmood q. Output Print m lines, in i-th line print single integer \u2014 the answer\nto the problem with q = bi. Example Input 6 3 8 -5 -4 1 -7 4 0 7 3 Output 2 0\n1\n\n",
