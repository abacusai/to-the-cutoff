        "description": "Koa the Koala has a directed graph \n    G\n with \n    n\n nodes and \n    m\n\nedges. Each edge has a capacity associated with it. Exactly \n    k\n edges of\nthe graph, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    k\n, are special, such edges initially\nhave a capacity equal to \n    0\n. Koa asks you \n    q\n queries. In each query\nshe gives you \n    k\n integers \n    w_1, w_2, \n    \u2026, w_k\n. This means that\ncapacity of the \n    i\n-th special edge becomes \n    w_i\n (and other\ncapacities remain the same). Koa wonders: what is the maximum flow that goes\nfrom node \n    1\n to node \n    n\n after each such query? Help her! Input The\nfirst line of the input contains four integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, \n    k\n,\n\n    q\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^4\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^4\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k\n    \n    \u2264\n    min(10, m)\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\nnodes, the number of edges, the number of special edges and the number of\nqueries. Each of the next \n    m\n lines contains three integers \n    u\n,\n\n    v\n, \n    w\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u, v \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264 w \n    \u2264 25\n) \u2014 the\ndescription of a directed edge from node \n    u\n to node \n    v\n with capacity\n\n    w\n. Edges are numbered starting from \n    1\n in the same order they are\nlisted in the input. The first \n    k\n edges are the special edges. It is\nguaranteed that \n    w_i = 0\n for all \n    i\n with \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 k\n.\nEach of the next \n    q\n lines contains \n    k\n integers \n    w_1, w_2,\n    \n    \u2026, w_k\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 w_i \n    \u2264 25\n) \u2014 the description of the query.\n\n    w_i\n denotes the capacity of \n    i\n-th edge. Output For the \n    i\n-th\nquery, print one integer \n    res_i\n \u2014 the maximum flow that can be obtained\nfrom node \n    1\n to node \n    n\n given the \n    i\n-th query's special edge\nweights. Examples Input 2 1 1 3 1 2 0 0 1 2 Output 0 1 2 Input 4 4 2 5 1 2 0 2\n3 0 2 4 5 3 4 2 0 0 1 10 10 0 7 1 7 2 Output 0 1 5 6 7 Note For the second\nsample, the following images correspond to the first two queries (from left to\nright respectively). For each edge there is a pair flow/capacity denoting flow\npushed through the edge and edge's capacity. The special edges are colored in\nred. As you can see in first query maximum flow from node \n    1\n to node\n\n    4\n equals \n    0\n and in second query equals \n    1\n.\n\n",
