        "description": "This is an interactive problem. After emigrating to another country, little\nHanna came across the fact that playing \"Hot and cold\" became more difficult:\nshe does not understand the hint phrases! You are to write a helping program\nfor her. The playground where the game happens is a rectangle, and the\ntreasure is hidden in some point with integer coordinates between 0 and\n\n    10^6\n, inclusive. Hanna visits several points with valid coordinates. If\nthe visited point contains the hidden treasure, she receives the phrase\n\"Found!\" in the local language. Fortunately, the intonations allow her to\nrecognize this phrase \u2014 in this problem it will be denoted by an exclamation\nmark. Otherwise, for each visited point except for the first one, Hanna\nreceives a phrase in the local language stating whether she is now \"Closer\",\n\"Further\", or \"At the same distance\" from the treasure, compared to the\nprevious point. The distances are measured in Euclidean metric. After the\nfirst visited point, in case of no treasure there, Hanna receives the phrase\n\"Not found\" in the local language. Your program must help Hanna find the\ntreasure by visiting at most 64 points. Interaction Your program should print\neach visited point in a line with two coordinates between 0 and \n    10^6\n,\ninclusive, and flush the output after each one. For each visited point, the\ntesting system writes one of the phrases: \"Found!\", \"Closer\", \"Further\", \"At\nthe same distance\", or \"Not found\" in some language, consistent throughout the\ngame. The first phrase ends with an exclamation mark, all other phrases do not\ncontain exclamation marks. All phrases contain only Latin letters, spaces and\nexclamation marks, have lengths between 2 and 30, inclusive, don't start or\nend with a space, and are pairwise distinct. The phrases are not necessarily\ncoming from any real human language. After receiving a phrase with an\nexclamation mark, your program must halt without printing anything else.\nVisiting points more than once is allowed, and each such visit counts towards\nthe limit of 64 queries.
