        "description": "A game field is a strip of 1 \u00d7 n square cells. In some cells there are\nPackmen, in some cells \u2014 asterisks, other cells are empty. Packman can move to\nneighboring cell in 1 time unit. If there is an asterisk in the target cell\nthen Packman eats it. Packman doesn't spend any time to eat an asterisk. In\nthe initial moment of time all Packmen begin to move. Each Packman can change\ndirection of its move unlimited number of times, but it is not allowed to go\nbeyond the boundaries of the game field. Packmen do not interfere with the\nmovement of other packmen; in one cell there can be any number of packmen\nmoving in any directions. Your task is to determine minimum possible time\nafter which Packmen can eat all the asterisks. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the length of the game field. The second\nline contains the description of the game field consisting of n symbols. If\nthere is symbol '.' in position i \u2014 the cell i is empty. If there is symbol\n'*' in position i \u2014 in the cell i contains an asterisk. If there is symbol 'P'\nin position i \u2014 Packman is in the cell i. It is guaranteed that on the game\nfield there is at least one Packman and at least one asterisk. Output Print\nminimum possible time after which Packmen can eat all asterisks. Examples\nInput 7 *..P*P* Output 3 Input 10 .**PP.*P.* Output 2 Note In the first\nexample Packman in position 4 will move to the left and will eat asterisk in\nposition 1. He will spend 3 time units on it. During the same 3 time units\nPackman in position 6 will eat both of neighboring with it asterisks. For\nexample, it can move to the left and eat asterisk in position 5 (in 1 time\nunit) and then move from the position 5 to the right and eat asterisk in the\nposition 7 (in 2 time units). So in 3 time units Packmen will eat all\nasterisks on the game field. In the second example Packman in the position 4\nwill move to the left and after 2 time units will eat asterisks in positions 3\nand 2. Packmen in positions 5 and 8 will move to the right and in 2 time units\nwill eat asterisks in positions 7 and 10, respectively. So 2 time units is\nenough for Packmen to eat all asterisks on the game field.\n\n",
