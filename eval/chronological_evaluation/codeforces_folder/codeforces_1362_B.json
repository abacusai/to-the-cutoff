        "name": "Johnny and His Hobbies",
        "description": "Among Johnny's numerous hobbies, there are two seemingly harmless ones:\napplying bitwise operations and sneaking into his dad's office. As it is\nusually the case with small children, Johnny is unaware that combining these\ntwo activities can get him in a lot of trouble. There is a set \n    S\n\ncontaining very important numbers on his dad's desk. The minute Johnny heard\nabout it, he decided that it's a good idea to choose a positive integer\n\n    k\n and replace each element \n    s\n of the set \n    S\n with \n    s \n    \u2295\n    k\n (\n    \u2295\n denotes the exclusive or operation). Help him choose such\n\n    k\n that Johnny's dad will not see any difference after his son is done\nplaying (i.e. Johnny will get the same set as before playing). It is possible\nthat no such number exists. It is also possible that there are many of them.\nIn such a case, output the smallest one. Note that the order of elements in a\nset doesn't matter, i.e. set \n    1, 2, 3\n equals to set \n    2,\n    1, 3\n. Formally, find the smallest positive integer \n    k\n such that\n\n    s \n    \u2295 k | s \n    \u2208 S\n    \n     = S\n or report that there is no such\nnumber. For example, if \n    S = \n    \n    1, 3, 4\n and \n    k = 2\n, new set\nwill be equal to \n    3, 1, 6\n. If \n    S = \n    \n    0, 1, 2, 3\n\nand \n    k = 1\n, after playing set will stay the same. Input In the first line\nof input, there is a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1024\n),\nthe number of test cases. In the next lines, \n    t\n test cases follow. Each\nof them consists of two lines. In the first line there is a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1024\n) denoting the number of elements in set\n\n    S\n. Second line consists of \n    n\n distinct integers \n    s_i\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 s_i < 1024\n), elements of \n    S\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases will not exceed \n    1024\n. Output Print \n    t\n\nlines; \n    i\n-th line should contain the answer to the \n    i\n-th test case,\nthe minimal positive integer \n    k\n satisfying the conditions or \n    -1\n if\nno such \n    k\n exists. Example Input 6 4 1 0 2 3 6 10 7 14 8 3 12 2 0 2 3 1 2\n3 6 1 4 6 10 11 12 2 0 1023 Output 1 4 2 -1 -1 1023 Note In the first test\ncase, the answer is \n    1\n because it is a minimum positive integer and it\nsatisfies all the conditions.\n\n",
