        "description": "Pak Chanek has an \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n grid of portals. The portal on the\n\n    i\n-th row and \n    j\n-th column is denoted as portal \n    (i,j)\n. The\nportals \n    (1,1)\n and \n    (n,m)\n are on the north-west and south-east\ncorner of the grid respectively. The portal \n    (i,j)\n has two settings: Type\n\n    t_i,j\n, which is either \n    0\n or \n    1\n. Strength \n    s_i,j\n,\nwhich is an integer between \n    1\n and \n    10^9\n inclusive. Each portal has\n\n    4\n faces labelled with integers \n    0,1,2,3\n, which correspond to the\nnorth, east, south, and west direction respectively. When a laser enters face\n\n    k\n of portal \n    (i, j)\n with speed \n    x_\n    in\n, it leaves the\nportal going out of face \n    (k+2+t_i,j) \n     4\n with speed\n\n    x_\n    out = \n    max(x_\n    in,s_i,j)\n. The portal also has to\nconsume \n    x_\n    out - x_\n    in\n units of energy. Pak Chanek is\nvery bored today. He will shoot \n    4nm\n lasers with an initial speed of\n\n    1\n, one into each face of each portal. Each laser will travel throughout\nthis grid of portals until it moves outside the grid or it has passed through\n\n    10^100\n portals. At the end, Pak Chanek thinks that a portal is good if\nand only if the total energy consumed by that portal modulo \n    2\n is equal\nto its type. Given the strength settings of all portals, find a way to assign\nthe type settings of each portal such that the number of good portals is\nmaximised. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the grid.\nThe \n    i\n-th of the next \n    n\n lines contains \n    m\n integers, with the\n\n    j\n-th integer being \n    s_i,j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 s_i,j\n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014\nthe strength of portal \n    (i, j)\n. Output Print \n    n\n lines with each line\ncontaining a string of length \n    m\n consisting of characters \n    0\n or\n\n    1\n representing the type settings. The \n    j\n-th character in the\n\n    i\n-th string is the type setting of portal \n    (i, j)\n. If there are\nmultiple solutions, you can output any of them. Examples Input 2 3 8 8 2 6 5 7\nOutput 110 100 Input 1 2 420 69 Output 10 Note In the first example, let's\nconsider the laser Pak Chanek shoots into face \n    1\n of portal \n    (2, 2)\n.\nThe laser travels as follows: The laser enters face \n    1\n of portal \n    (2,\n    2)\n with speed \n    1\n. It leaves the portal going out of face \n    3\n with\nspeed \n    5\n. Portal \n    (2, 2)\n consumes \n    4\n units of energy. The laser\nenters face \n    1\n of portal \n    (2, 1)\n with speed \n    5\n. It leaves the\nportal going out of face \n    0\n with speed \n    6\n. Portal \n    (2, 1)\n\nconsumes \n    1\n units of energy. The laser enters face \n    2\n of portal\n\n    (1, 1)\n with speed \n    6\n. It leaves the portal going out of face\n\n    1\n with speed \n    8\n. Portal \n    (1, 1)\n consumes \n    2\n units of\nenergy. The laser enters face \n    3\n of portal \n    (1, 2)\n with speed\n\n    8\n. It leaves the portal going out of face \n    2\n with speed \n    8\n.\nPortal \n    (1, 2)\n consumes \n    0\n units of energy. The laser enters face\n\n    0\n of portal \n    (2, 2)\n with speed \n    8\n. It leaves the portal going\nout of face \n    2\n with speed \n    8\n. Portal \n    (2, 2)\n consumes \n    0\n\nunits of energy. The illustration of the travel of the laser above is as\nfollows. As an example, consider portal \n    (2, 3)\n. We can calculate that\nthe total energy consumed by that portal in the end will be \n    32\n. Since\n\n    32 \n     2 = 0\n and \n    t_2,3 = 0\n, then it is a good portal.\n\n",
