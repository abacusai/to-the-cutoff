        "description": "Alice likes snow a lot! Unfortunately, this year's winter is already over, and\nshe can't expect to have any more of it. Bob has thus bought her a gift \u2014 a\nlarge snow maker. He plans to make some amount of snow every day. On day i he\nwill make a pile of snow of volume Vi and put it in her garden. Each day,\nevery pile will shrink a little due to melting. More precisely, when the\ntemperature on a given day is Ti, each pile will reduce its volume by Ti. If\nthis would reduce the volume of a pile to or below zero, it disappears\nforever. All snow piles are independent of each other. Note that the pile made\non day i already loses part of its volume on the same day. In an extreme case,\nthis may mean that there are no piles left at the end of a particular day. You\nare given the initial pile sizes and the temperature on each day. Determine\nthe total volume of snow melted on each day. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of days. The second line contains\nN integers V1, V2, ..., VN (0 \u2264 Vi \u2264 10^9), where Vi is the initial size of a\nsnow pile made on the day i. The third line contains N integers T1, T2, ...,\nTN (0 \u2264 Ti \u2264 10^9), where Ti is the temperature on the day i. Output Output a\nsingle line with N integers, where the i-th integer represents the total\nvolume of snow melted on day i. Examples Input 3 10 10 5 5 7 2 Output 5 12 4\nInput 5 30 25 20 15 10 9 10 12 4 13 Output 9 20 35 11 25 Note In the first\nsample, Bob first makes a snow pile of volume 10, which melts to the size of 5\non the same day. On the second day, he makes another pile of size 10. Since it\nis a bit warmer than the day before, the first pile disappears completely\nwhile the second pile shrinks to 3. At the end of the second day, he has only\na single pile of size 3. On the third day he makes a smaller pile than usual,\nbut as the temperature dropped too, both piles survive till the end of the\nday.\n\n",
