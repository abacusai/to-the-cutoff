        "description": "Victor wants to become \"Mr. Perfectly Fine\". For that, he needs to acquire a\ncertain set of skills. More precisely, he has \n    2\n skills he needs to\nacquire. Victor has \n    n\n books. Reading book \n    i\n takes him \n    m_i\n\nminutes and will give him some (possibly none) of the required two skills,\nrepresented by a binary string of length \n    2\n. What is the minimum amount\nof time required so that Victor acquires all of the two skills? Input The\ninput consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of books available. Then \n    n\n lines follow. Line \n    i\n contains a\npositive integer \n    m_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) and a\nbinary string of length \n    2\n, where \n    s_i1 = 1\n if reading book\n\n    i\n acquires Victor skill \n    1\n, and \n    s_i1 = 0\n otherwise, and\n\n    s_i2 = 1\n if reading book \n    i\n acquires Victor skill \n    2\n, and\n\n    s_i2 = 0\n otherwise. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case,\noutput a single integer denoting the minimum amount of minutes required for\nVictor to obtain both needed skills and \n    -1\n in case it's impossible to\nobtain the two skills after reading any amount of books. Example Input 6 4 2\n00 3 10 4 01 4 00 5 3 01 3 01 5 01 2 10 9 10 1 5 11 3 9 11 8 01 7 10 6 4 01 6\n01 7 01 8 00 9 01 1 00 4 8 00 9 10 9 11 8 11 Output 7 5 5 9 -1 8 Note In the\nfirst test case, we can use books \n    2\n and \n    3\n, with a total amount of\nminutes spent equal to \n    3 + 4 = 7\n. In the second test case, we can use\nthe books \n    1\n and \n    4\n, with a total amount of minutes spent equal to\n\n    3 + 2 = 5\n. In the third test case, we have only one option and that is\nreading book \n    1\n for a total amount of minutes spent equal to \n    5\n.\n\n",
