        "description": "A girl named Xenia has a cupboard that looks like an arc from ahead. The arc\nis made of a semicircle with radius r (the cupboard's top) and two walls of\nheight h (the cupboard's sides). The cupboard's depth is r, that is, it looks\nlike a rectangle with base r and height h + r from the sides. The figure below\nshows what the cupboard looks like (the front view is on the left, the side\nview is on the right). Xenia got lots of balloons for her birthday. The girl\nhates the mess, so she wants to store the balloons in the cupboard. Luckily,\neach balloon is a sphere with radius . Help Xenia calculate the maximum number\nof balloons she can put in her cupboard. You can say that a balloon is in the\ncupboard if you can't see any part of the balloon on the left or right view.\nThe balloons in the cupboard can touch each other. It is not allowed to\nsqueeze the balloons or deform them in any way. You can assume that the\ncupboard's walls are negligibly thin. Input The single line contains two\nintegers r, h (1 \u2264 r, h \u2264 10^7). Output Print a single integer \u2014 the maximum\nnumber of balloons Xenia can put in the cupboard. Examples Input 1 1 Output 3\nInput 1 2 Output 5 Input 2 1 Output 2\n\n",
