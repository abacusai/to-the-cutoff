        "description": "Each student eagerly awaits the day he would pass the exams successfully.\nThus, Vasya was ready to celebrate, but, alas, he didn't pass it. However,\nmany of Vasya's fellow students from the same group were more successful and\ncelebrated after the exam. Some of them celebrated in the BugDonalds\nrestaurant, some of them \u2014 in the BeaverKing restaurant, the most successful\nones were fast enough to celebrate in both of restaurants. Students which\ndidn't pass the exam didn't celebrate in any of those restaurants and elected\nto stay home to prepare for their reexamination. However, this quickly bored\nVasya and he started checking celebration photos on the Kilogramm. He found\nout that, in total, BugDonalds was visited by \n    A\n students, BeaverKing \u2014\nby \n    B\n students and \n    C\n students visited both restaurants. Vasya also\nknows that there are \n    N\n students in his group. Based on this info, Vasya\nwants to determine either if his data contradicts itself or, if it doesn't,\nhow many students in his group didn't pass the exam. Can you help him so he\nwon't waste his valuable preparation time? Input The first line contains four\nintegers \u2014 \n    A\n, \n    B\n, \n    C\n and \n    N\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 A, B, C, N\n    \n    \u2264 100\n). Output If a distribution of \n    N\n students exists in which\n\n    A\n students visited BugDonalds, \n    B\n \u2014 BeaverKing, \n    C\n \u2014 both of\nthe restaurants and at least one student is left home (it is known that Vasya\ndidn't pass the exam and stayed at home), output one integer \u2014 amount of\nstudents (including Vasya) who did not pass the exam. If such a distribution\ndoes not exist and Vasya made a mistake while determining the numbers \n    A\n,\n\n    B\n, \n    C\n or \n    N\n (as in samples 2 and 3), output \n    -1\n. Examples\nInput 10 10 5 20 Output 5 Input 2 2 0 4 Output -1 Input 2 2 2 1 Output -1 Note\nThe first sample describes following situation: \n    5\n only visited\nBugDonalds, \n    5\n students only visited BeaverKing, \n    5\n visited both of\nthem and \n    5\n students (including Vasya) didn't pass the exam. In the\nsecond sample \n    2\n students only visited BugDonalds and \n    2\n only\nvisited BeaverKing, but that means all \n    4\n students in group passed the\nexam which contradicts the fact that Vasya didn't pass meaning that this\nsituation is impossible. The third sample describes a situation where \n    2\n\nstudents visited BugDonalds but the group has only \n    1\n which makes it\nclearly impossible.\n\n",
