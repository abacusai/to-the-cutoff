        "description": "It's a walking tour day in SIS.Winter, so \n    t\n groups of students are\nvisiting Torzhok. Streets of Torzhok are so narrow that students have to go in\na row one after another. Initially, some students are angry. Let's describe a\ngroup of students by a string of capital letters \"A\" and \"P\": \"A\" corresponds\nto an angry student \"P\" corresponds to a patient student Such string describes\nthe row from the last to the first student. Every minute every angry student\nthrows a snowball at the next student. Formally, if an angry student\ncorresponds to the character with index \n    i\n in the string describing a\ngroup then they will throw a snowball at the student that corresponds to the\ncharacter with index \n    i+1\n (students are given from the last to the first\nstudent). If the target student was not angry yet, they become angry. Even if\nthe first (the rightmost in the string) student is angry, they don't throw a\nsnowball since there is no one in front of them. Let's look at the first\nexample test. The row initially looks like this: PPAP. Then, after a minute\nthe only single angry student will throw a snowball at the student in front of\nthem, and they also become angry: PPAA. After that, no more students will\nbecome angry. Your task is to help SIS.Winter teachers to determine the last\nmoment a student becomes angry for every group. Input The first line contains\na single integer \n    t\n \u2014 the number of groups of students (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 100\n). The following \n    2t\n lines contain descriptions of groups of\nstudents. The description of the group starts with an integer \n    k_i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 k_i \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of students in the group, followed by a\nstring \n    s_i\n, consisting of \n    k_i\n letters \"A\" and \"P\", which describes\nthe \n    i\n-th group of students. Output For every group output single integer\n\u2014 the last moment a student becomes angry. Examples Input 1 4 PPAP Output 1\nInput 3 12 APPAPPPAPPPP 3 AAP 3 PPA Output 4 1 0 Note In the first test, after\n\n    1\n minute the state of students becomes PPAA. After that, no new angry\nstudents will appear. In the second tets, state of students in the first group\nis: after \n    1\n minute \u2014 AAPAAPPAAPPP after \n    2\n minutes \u2014 AAAAAAPAAAPP\nafter \n    3\n minutes \u2014 AAAAAAAAAAAP after \n    4\n minutes all \n    12\n\nstudents are angry In the second group after \n    1\n minute, all students are\nangry.\n\n",
