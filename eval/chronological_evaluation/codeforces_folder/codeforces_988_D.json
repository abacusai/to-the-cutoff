        "description": "There are \n    n\n distinct points on a coordinate line, the coordinate of\n\n    i\n-th point equals to \n    x_i\n. Choose a subset of the given set of\npoints such that the distance between each pair of points in a subset is an\nintegral power of two. It is necessary to consider each pair of points, not\nonly adjacent. Note that any subset containing one element satisfies the\ncondition above. Among all these subsets, choose a subset with maximum\npossible size. In other words, you have to choose the maximum possible number\nof points \n    x_i_1, x_i_2, \n    \u2026, x_i_m\n such that for each pair\n\n    x_i_j\n, \n    x_i_k\n it is true that \n    |x_i_j - x_i_k| = 2^d\n\nwhere \n    d\n is some non-negative integer number (not necessarily the same\nfor each pair of points). Input The first line contains one integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of points. The second line\ncontains \n    n\n pairwise distinct integers \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n\n\n(\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the coordinates of points. Output In the\nfirst line print \n    m\n \u2014 the maximum possible number of points in a subset\nthat satisfies the conditions described above. In the second line print\n\n    m\n integers \u2014 the coordinates of points in the subset you have chosen. If\nthere are multiple answers, print any of them. Examples Input 6 3 5 4 7 10 12\nOutput 3 7 3 5 Input 5 -1 2 5 8 11 Output 1 8 Note In the first example the\nanswer is \n    [7, 3, 5]\n. Note, that \n    |7-3|=4=2^2\n, \n    |7-5|=2=2^1\n and\n\n    |3-5|=2=2^1\n. You can't find a subset having more points satisfying the\nrequired property.\n\n",
