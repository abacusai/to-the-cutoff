        "description": "Let us remind you part of the rules of Codeforces. The given rules slightly\nsimplified, use the problem statement as a formal document. In the beginning\nof the round the contestants are divided into rooms. Each room contains\nexactly n participants. During the contest the participants are suggested to\nsolve five problems, A, B, C, D and E. For each of these problem, depending on\nwhen the given problem was solved and whether it was solved at all, the\nparticipants receive some points. Besides, a contestant can perform hacks on\nother contestants. For each successful hack a contestant earns 100 points, for\neach unsuccessful hack a contestant loses 50 points. The number of points for\nevery contestant is represented by the sum of points he has received from all\nhis problems, including hacks. You are suggested to determine the leader for\nsome room; the leader is a participant who has maximum points. Input The first\nline contains an integer n, which is the number of contestants in the room (1\n\u2264 n \u2264 50). The next n lines contain the participants of a given room. The i-th\nline has the format of \"handlei plusi minusi ai bi ci di ei\" \u2014 it is the\nhandle of a contestant, the number of successful hacks, the number of\nunsuccessful hacks and the number of points he has received from problems A,\nB, C, D, E correspondingly. The handle of each participant consists of Latin\nletters, digits and underscores and has the length from 1 to 20 characters.\nThere are the following limitations imposed upon the numbers: 0 \u2264 plusi,\nminusi \u2264 50; 150 \u2264 ai \u2264 500 or ai = 0, if problem A is not solved; 300 \u2264 bi \u2264\n1000 or bi = 0, if problem B is not solved; 450 \u2264 ci \u2264 1500 or ci = 0, if\nproblem C is not solved; 600 \u2264 di \u2264 2000 or di = 0, if problem D is not\nsolved; 750 \u2264 ei \u2264 2500 or ei = 0, if problem E is not solved. All the numbers\nare integer. All the participants have different handles. It is guaranteed\nthat there is exactly one leader in the room (i.e. there are no two\nparticipants with the maximal number of points). Output Print on the single\nline the handle of the room leader.
