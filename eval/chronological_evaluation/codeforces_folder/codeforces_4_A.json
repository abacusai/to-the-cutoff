        "description": "One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They\nchose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the\nwatermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying\nof thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.\nPete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide\nthe watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of\nkilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The\nboys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible,\nthat's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the\nwatermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of\npositive weight. Input The first (and the only) input line contains integer\nnumber w (1 \u2264 w \u2264 100) \u2014 the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.\nOutput Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each\nof them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case. Examples\nInput 8 Output YES Note For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into\ntwo parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant \u2014 two parts of 4 and\n4 kilos).\n\n",
