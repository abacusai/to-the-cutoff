        "description": "Consider a playoff tournament where \n    2^n\n athletes compete. The athletes\nare numbered from \n    1\n to \n    2^n\n. The tournament is held in \n    n\n\nstages. In each stage, the athletes are split into pairs in such a way that\neach athlete belongs exactly to one pair. In each pair, the athletes compete\nagainst each other, and exactly one of them wins. The winner of each pair\nadvances to the next stage, the athlete who was defeated gets eliminated from\nthe tournament. The pairs are formed as follows: in the first stage, athlete\n\n    1\n competes against athlete \n    2\n; \n    3\n competes against \n    4\n;\n\n    5\n competes against \n    6\n, and so on; in the second stage, the winner\nof the match \"\n    1\n\u2013\n    2\n\" competes against the winner of the match\n\"\n    3\n\u2013\n    4\n\"; the winner of the match \"\n    5\n\u2013\n    6\n\" competes against\nthe winner of the match \"\n    7\n\u2013\n    8\n\", and so on; the next stages are held\naccording to the same rules. When athletes \n    x\n and \n    y\n compete, the\nwinner is decided as follows: if \n    x+y\n is odd, the athlete with the lower\nindex wins (i. e. if \n    x < y\n, then \n    x\n wins, otherwise \n    y\n wins);\nif \n    x+y\n is even, the athlete with the higher index wins. The following\npicture describes the way the tournament with \n    n = 3\n goes. Your task is\nthe following one: given the integer \n    n\n, determine the index of the\nathlete who wins the tournament. Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 30\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case\nconsists of one line containing one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    30\n). Output For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the index of the winner\nof the tournament. Example Input 2 3 1 Output 7 1 Note The case \n    n = 3\n is\nshown in the picture from the statement. If \n    n = 1\n, then there's only one\nmatch between athletes \n    1\n and \n    2\n. Since \n    1 + 2 = 3\n is an odd\nnumber, the athlete with the lower index wins. So, the athlete \n    1\n is the\nwinner.\n\n",
