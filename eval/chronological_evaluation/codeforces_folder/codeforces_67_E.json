        "description": "In the town of Aalam-Aara (meaning the Light of the Earth), previously there\nwas no crime, no criminals but as the time progressed, sins started creeping\ninto the hearts of once righteous people. Seeking solution to the problem,\nsome of the elders found that as long as the corrupted part of population was\nkept away from the uncorrupted part, the crimes could be stopped. So, they are\ntrying to set up a compound where they can keep the corrupted people. To\nensure that the criminals don't escape the compound, a watchtower needs to be\nset up, so that they can be watched. Since the people of Aalam-Aara aren't\nvery rich, they met up with a merchant from some rich town who agreed to sell\nthem a land-plot which has already a straight line fence AB along which a few\npoints are set up where they can put up a watchtower. Your task is to help\nthem find out the number of points on that fence where the tower can be put\nup, so that all the criminals can be watched from there. Only one watchtower\ncan be set up. A criminal is watchable from the watchtower if the line of\nvisibility from the watchtower to him doesn't cross the plot-edges at any\npoint between him and the tower i.e. as shown in figure 1 below, points X, Y,\nC and A are visible from point B but the points E and D are not. Figure 1\nFigure 2 Assume that the land plot is in the shape of a polygon and coordinate\naxes have been setup such that the fence AB is parallel to x-axis and the\npoints where the watchtower can be set up are the integer points on the line.\nFor example, in given figure 2, watchtower can be setup on any of five integer\npoints on AB i.e. (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8) or (8, 8). You can assume\nthat no three consecutive points are collinear and all the corner points other\nthan A and B, lie towards same side of fence AB. The given polygon doesn't\ncontain self-intersections. Input The first line of the test case will consist\nof the number of vertices n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 1000). Next n lines will contain the\ncoordinates of the vertices in the clockwise order of the polygon. On the i-th\nline are integers xi and yi (0 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 10^6) separated by a space. The\nendpoints of the fence AB are the first two points, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).\nOutput Output consists of a single line containing the number of points where\nthe watchtower can be set up. Examples Input 5 4 8 8 8 9 4 4 0 0 4 Output 5\nInput 5 4 8 5 8 5 4 7 4 2 2 Output 0 Note Figure 2 shows the first test case.\nAll the points in the figure are watchable from any point on fence AB. Since,\nAB has 5 integer coordinates, so answer is 5. For case two, fence CD and DE\nare not completely visible, thus answer is 0.\n\n",
