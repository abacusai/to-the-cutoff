        "description": "A film festival is coming up in the city N. The festival will last for exactly\nn days and each day will have a premiere of exactly one film. Each film has a\ngenre \u2014 an integer from 1 to k. On the i-th day the festival will show a movie\nof genre ai. We know that a movie of each of k genres occurs in the festival\nprogramme at least once. In other words, each integer from 1 to k occurs in\nthe sequence a1, a2, ..., an at least once. Valentine is a movie critic. He\nwants to watch some movies of the festival and then describe his impressions\non his site. As any creative person, Valentine is very susceptive. After he\nwatched the movie of a certain genre, Valentine forms the mood he preserves\nuntil he watches the next movie. If the genre of the next movie is the same,\nit does not change Valentine's mood. If the genres are different, Valentine's\nmood changes according to the new genre and Valentine has a stress. Valentine\ncan't watch all n movies, so he decided to exclude from his to-watch list\nmovies of one of the genres. In other words, Valentine is going to choose\nexactly one of the k genres and will skip all the movies of this genre. He is\nsure to visit other movies. Valentine wants to choose such genre x (1 \u2264 x \u2264\nk), that the total number of after-movie stresses (after all movies of genre x\nare excluded) were minimum. Input The first line of the input contains two\nintegers n and k (2 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), where n is the number of movies and k is\nthe number of genres. The second line of the input contains a sequence of n\npositive integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 k), where ai is the genre of the\ni-th movie. It is guaranteed that each number from 1 to k occurs at least once\nin this sequence. Output Print a single number \u2014 the number of the genre (from\n1 to k) of the excluded films. If there are multiple answers, print the genre\nwith the minimum number. Examples Input 10 3 1 1 2 3 2 3 3 1 1 3 Output 3\nInput 7 3 3 1 3 2 3 1 2 Output 1 Note In the first sample if we exclude the\nmovies of the 1st genre, the genres 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3 remain, that is 3\nstresses; if we exclude the movies of the 2nd genre, the genres 1, 1, 3, 3, 3,\n1, 1, 3 remain, that is 3 stresses; if we exclude the movies of the 3rd genre\nthe genres 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1 remain, that is 2 stresses. In the second sample\nwhatever genre Valentine excludes, he will have exactly 3 stresses.\n\n",
