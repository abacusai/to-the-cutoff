        "description": "This problem consists of three subproblems: for solving subproblem F1 you will\nreceive 8 points, for solving subproblem F2 you will receive 15 points, and\nfor solving subproblem F3 you will receive 10 points. Manao has developed a\nmodel to predict the stock price of a company over the next n days and wants\nto design a profit-maximizing trading algorithm to make use of these\npredictions. Unfortunately, Manao's trading account has the following\nrestrictions: It only allows owning either zero or one shares of stock at a\ntime; It only allows buying or selling a share of this stock once per day; It\nallows a maximum of k buy orders over the next n days; For the purposes of\nthis problem, we define a trade to a be the act of buying one share of stock\non day i, then holding the stock until some day j > i at which point the share\nis sold. To restate the above constraints, Manao is permitted to make at most\nk non-overlapping trades during the course of an n-day trading period for\nwhich Manao's model has predictions about the stock price. Even though these\nrestrictions limit the amount of profit Manao can make compared to what would\nbe achievable with an unlimited number of trades or the ability to hold more\nthan one share at a time, Manao still has the potential to make a lot of money\nbecause Manao's model perfectly predicts the daily price of the stock. For\nexample, using this model, Manao could wait until the price is low, then buy\none share and hold until the price reaches a high value, then sell for a\nprofit, and repeat this process up to k times until n days have passed.\nNevertheless, Manao is not satisfied by having a merely good trading\nalgorithm, and wants to develop an optimal strategy for trading subject to\nthese constraints. Help Manao achieve this goal by writing a program that will\ndetermine when to buy and sell stock to achieve the greatest possible profit\nduring the n-day trading period subject to the above constraints. Input The\nfirst line contains two integers n and k, separated by a single space, with .\nThe i-th of the following n lines contains a single integer pi (0 \u2264 pi \u2264\n10^12), where pi represents the price at which someone can either buy or sell\none share of stock on day i. The problem consists of three subproblems. The\nsubproblems have different constraints on the input. You will get some score\nfor the correct submission of the subproblem. The description of the\nsubproblems follows. In subproblem F1 (8 points), n will be between 1 and\n3000, inclusive. In subproblem F2 (15 points), n will be between 1 and 100000,\ninclusive. In subproblem F3 (10 points), n will be between 1 and 4000000,\ninclusive. Output For this problem, the program will only report the amount of\nthe optimal profit, rather than a list of trades that can achieve this profit.\nTherefore, the program should print one line containing a single integer, the\nmaximum profit Manao can achieve over the next n days with the constraints of\nstarting with no shares on the first day of trading, always owning either zero\nor one shares of stock, and buying at most k shares over the course of the\nn-day trading period. Examples Input 10 2 2 7 3 9 8 7 9 7 1 9 Output 15 Input\n10 5 2 7 3 9 8 7 9 7 1 9 Output 21 Note In the first example, the best trade\noverall is to buy at a price of 1 on day 9 and sell at a price of 9 on day 10\nand the second best trade overall is to buy at a price of 2 on day 1 and sell\nat a price of 9 on day 4. Since these two trades do not overlap, both can be\nmade and the profit is the sum of the profits of the two trades. Thus the\ntrade strategy looks like this: 2 | 7 | 3 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 9 | 7 | 1 | 9 buy | |\n| sell | | | | | buy | sell The total profit is then (9 - 2) + (9 - 1) = 15.\nIn the second example, even though Manao is allowed up to 5 trades there are\nonly 4 profitable trades available. Making a fifth trade would cost Manao\nmoney so he only makes the following 4: 2 | 7 | 3 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 9 | 7 | 1 | 9\nbuy | sell | buy | sell | | buy | sell | | buy | sell The total profit is then\n(7 - 2) + (9 - 3) + (9 - 7) + (9 - 1) = 21.\n\n",
