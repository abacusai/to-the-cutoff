        "description": "Seryozha has a very changeable character. This time he refused to leave the\nroom to Dima and his girlfriend (her hame is Inna, by the way). However, the\ntwo lovebirds can always find a way to communicate. Today they are writing\ntext messages to each other. Dima and Inna are using a secret code in their\ntext messages. When Dima wants to send Inna some sentence, he writes out all\nwords, inserting a heart before each word and after the last word. A heart is\na sequence of two characters: the \"less\" characters (<) and the digit three\n(3). After applying the code, a test message looks like that: <3word1<3word2<3\n... wordn<3\u0116ncoding doesn't end here. Then Dima inserts a random number of\nsmall English characters, digits, signs \"more\" and \"less\" into any places of\nthe message. Inna knows Dima perfectly well, so she knows what phrase Dima is\ngoing to send her beforehand. Inna has just got a text message. Help her find\nout if Dima encoded the message correctly. In other words, find out if a text\nmessage could have been received by encoding in the manner that is described\nabove. Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of\nwords in Dima's message. Next n lines contain non-empty words, one word per\nline. The words only consist of small English letters. The total length of all\nwords doesn't exceed 10^5. The last line contains non-empty text message that\nInna has got. The number of characters in the text message doesn't exceed\n10^5. A text message can contain only small English letters, digits and signs\nmore and less. Output In a single line, print \"yes\" (without the quotes), if\nDima decoded the text message correctly, and \"no\" (without the quotes)\notherwise. Examples Input 3 i love you <3i<3love<23you<3 Output yes Input 7 i\nam not main in the family <3i<>3am<3the<3<3family<3 Output no Note Please note\nthat Dima got a good old kick in the pants for the second sample from the\nstatement.\n\n",
