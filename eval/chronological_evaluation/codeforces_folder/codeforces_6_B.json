        "description": "President of Berland has a very vast office-room, where, apart from him, work\nhis subordinates. Each subordinate, as well as President himself, has his own\ndesk of a unique colour. Each desk is rectangular, and its sides are parallel\nto the office walls. One day President decided to establish an assembly, of\nwhich all his deputies will be members. Unfortunately, he does not remember\nthe exact amount of his deputies, but he remembers that the desk of each his\ndeputy is adjacent to his own desk, that is to say, the two desks (President's\nand each deputy's) have a common side of a positive length. The office-room\nplan can be viewed as a matrix with n rows and m columns. Each cell of this\nmatrix is either empty, or contains a part of a desk. An uppercase Latin\nletter stands for each desk colour. The \u00abperiod\u00bb character (\u00ab.\u00bb) stands for an\nempty cell. Input The first line contains two separated by a space integer\nnumbers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100) \u2014 the length and the width of the office-room,\nand c character \u2014 the President's desk colour. The following n lines contain m\ncharacters each \u2014 the office-room description. It is guaranteed that the\ncolour of each desk is unique, and each desk represents a continuous\nsubrectangle of the given matrix. All colours are marked by uppercase Latin\nletters. Output Print the only number \u2014 the amount of President's deputies.\nExamples Input 3 4 R G.B. .RR. TTT. Output 2 Input 3 3 Z ... .H. ..Z Output 0\n\n",
