        "description": "Arnie the Worm has finished eating an apple house yet again and decided to\nmove. He made up his mind on the plan, the way the rooms are located and how\nthey are joined by corridors. He numbered all the rooms from 1 to n. All the\ncorridors are bidirectional. Arnie wants the new house to look just like the\nprevious one. That is, it should have exactly n rooms and, if a corridor from\nroom i to room j existed in the old house, it should be built in the new one.\nWe know that during the house constructing process Arnie starts to eat an\napple starting from some room and only stops when he eats his way through all\nthe corridors and returns to the starting room. It is also known that Arnie\neats without stopping. That is, until Arnie finishes constructing the house,\nhe is busy every moment of his time gnawing a new corridor. Arnie doesn't move\nalong the already built corridors. However, gnawing out corridors in one and\nthe same order any time you change a house is a very difficult activity.\nThat's why Arnie, knowing the order in which the corridors were located in the\nprevious house, wants to gnaw corridors in another order. It is represented as\na list of rooms in the order in which they should be visited. The new list\nshould be lexicographically smallest, but it also should be strictly\nlexicographically greater than the previous one. Help the worm. Input The\nfirst line contains two integers n and m (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 3 \u2264 m \u2264 2000). It is\nthe number of rooms and corridors in Arnie's house correspondingly. The next\nline contains m + 1 positive integers that do not exceed n. They are the\ndescription of Arnie's old path represented as a list of rooms he visited\nduring the gnawing. It is guaranteed that the last number in the list\ncoincides with the first one. The first room described in the list is the main\nentrance, that's why Arnie should begin gnawing from it. You may assume that\nthere is no room which is connected to itself and there is at most one\ncorridor between any pair of rooms. However, it is possible to find some\nisolated rooms which are disconnected from others. Output Print m + 1 positive\nintegers that do not exceed n. Those numbers are the description of the new\npath, according to which Arnie should gnaw out his new house. If it is\nimpossible to find new path you should print out No solution. The first number\nin your answer should be equal to the last one. Also it should be equal to the\nmain entrance. Examples Input 3 3 1 2 3 1 Output 1 3 2 1 Input 3 3 1 3 2 1\nOutput No solution\n\n",
