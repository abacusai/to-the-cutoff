        "name": "Lame King",
        "description": "You are given a checkerboard of size \n    201 \n    \u00d7 201\n, i. e. it has\n\n    201\n rows and \n    201\n columns. The rows of this checkerboard are\nnumbered from \n    -100\n to \n    100\n from bottom to top. The columns of this\ncheckerboard are numbered from \n    -100\n to \n    100\n from left to right. The\nnotation \n    (r, c)\n denotes the cell located in the \n    r\n-th row and the\n\n    c\n-th column. There is a king piece at position \n    (0, 0)\n and it wants\nto get to position \n    (a, b)\n as soon as possible. In this problem our king\nis lame. Each second, the king makes exactly one of the following five moves.\nSkip move. King's position remains unchanged. Go up. If the current position\nof the king is \n    (r, c)\n he goes to position \n    (r + 1, c)\n. Go down.\nPosition changes from \n    (r, c)\n to \n    (r - 1, c)\n. Go right. Position\nchanges from \n    (r, c)\n to \n    (r, c + 1)\n. Go left. Position changes from\n\n    (r, c)\n to \n    (r, c - 1)\n. King is not allowed to make moves that put\nhim outside of the board. The important consequence of the king being lame is\nthat he is not allowed to make the same move during two consecutive seconds.\nFor example, if the king goes right, the next second he can only skip, go up,\ndown, or left.What is the minimum number of seconds the lame king needs to\nreach position \n    (a, b)\n? Input The first line of the input contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Then follow \n    t\n lines containing one test case description each.\nEach test case consists of two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    -100 \n    \u2264 a,\n    b \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the position of the cell that the king wants to reach. It\nis guaranteed that either \n    a \n     0\n or \n    b \n     0\n. Output Print\n\n    t\n integers. The \n    i\n-th of these integers should be equal to the\nminimum number of seconds the lame king needs to get to the position he wants\nto reach in the \n    i\n-th test case. The king always starts at position\n\n    (0, 0)\n. Example Input 5 -4 1 4 4 0 -6 -5 -4 7 -8 Output 7 8 11 9 15 Note\nOne of the possible solutions for the first example is: go down, go right, go\ndown, go right, go down, go left, go down. One of the possible solutions for\nthe second example is to alternate \"go right\" and \"go up\" moves \n    4\n times\neach. One of the possible solutions for the third example is to alternate \"go\nleft\" and \"skip\" moves starting with \"go left\". Thus, \"go left\" will be used\n\n    6\n times, and \"skip\" will be used \n    5\n times.\n\n",
