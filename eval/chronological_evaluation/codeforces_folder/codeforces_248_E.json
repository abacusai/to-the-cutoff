        "description": "Piglet has got a birthday today. His friend Winnie the Pooh wants to make the\nbest present for him \u2014 a honey pot. Of course Winnie realizes that he won't\nmanage to get the full pot to Piglet. In fact, he is likely to eat all the\nhoney from the pot. And as soon as Winnie planned a snack on is way, the pot\nshould initially have as much honey as possible. The day before Winnie the\nPooh replenished his honey stocks. Winnie-the-Pooh has n shelves at home, each\nshelf contains some, perhaps zero number of honey pots. During the day Winnie\ncame to the honey shelves q times; on the i-th time he came to some shelf ui,\ntook from it some pots ki, tasted the honey from each pot and put all those\npots on some shelf vi. As Winnie chose the pots, he followed his intuition.\nAnd that means that among all sets of ki pots on shelf ui, he equiprobably\nchooses one. Now Winnie remembers all actions he performed with the honey\npots. He wants to take to the party the pot he didn't try the day before. For\nthat he must know the mathematical expectation of the number m of shelves that\ndon't have a single untasted pot. To evaluate his chances better, Winnie-the-\nPooh wants to know the value m after each action he performs. Your task is to\nwrite a program that will find those values for him. Input The first line of\nthe input contains a single number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of shelves at\nWinnie's place. The second line contains n integers ai (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 ai \u2264\n100) \u2014 the number of honey pots on a shelf number i. The next line contains\ninteger q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of actions Winnie did the day before.\nThen follow q lines, the i-th of them describes an event that follows\nchronologically; the line contains three integers ui, vi and ki (1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264\nn, 1 \u2264 ki \u2264 5) \u2014 the number of the shelf from which Winnie took pots, the\nnumber of the shelf on which Winnie put the pots after he tasted each of them,\nand the number of the pots Winnie tasted, correspondingly. Consider the\nshelves with pots numbered with integers from 1 to n. It is guaranteed that\nWinnie-the-Pooh Never tried taking more pots from the shelf than it has.\nOutput For each Winnie's action print the value of the mathematical\nexpectation m by the moment when this action is performed. The relative or\nabsolute error of each value mustn't exceed 10^-9.
