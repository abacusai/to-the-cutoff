        "description": "zscoder has a deck of \n    n+m\n custom-made cards, which consists of \n    n\n\ncards labelled from \n    1\n to \n    n\n and \n    m\n jokers. Since zscoder is\nlonely, he wants to play a game with himself using those cards. Initially, the\ndeck is shuffled uniformly randomly and placed on the table. zscoder has a set\n\n    S\n which is initially empty. Every second, zscoder draws the top card\nfrom the deck. If the card has a number \n    x\n written on it, zscoder removes\nthe card and adds \n    x\n to the set \n    S\n. If the card drawn is a joker,\nzscoder places all the cards back into the deck and reshuffles (uniformly\nrandomly) the \n    n+m\n cards to form a new deck (hence the new deck now\ncontains all cards from \n    1\n to \n    n\n and the \n    m\n jokers). Then, if\n\n    S\n currently contains all the elements from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, the game\nends. Shuffling the deck doesn't take time at all. What is the expected number\nof seconds before the game ends? We can show that the answer can be written in\nthe form \n    P/Q\n where \n    P, Q\n are relatively prime integers\nand \n    Q \n    \u2260 0 \n     998244353\n. Output the value of \n    (P \n    \u00b7\n    Q^-1)\n modulo \n    998244353\n. Input The only line of the input contains\ntwo integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^6\n).\nOutput Output a single integer, the value of \n    (P \n    \u00b7 Q^-1)\n modulo\n\n    998244353\n. Examples Input 2 1 Output 5 Input 3 2 Output 332748127 Input\n14 9 Output 969862773 Note For the first sample, it can be proven that the\nexpected time before the game ends is \n    5\n seconds. For the second sample,\nit can be proven that the expected time before the game ends is\n\n    28/3\n seconds.\n\n",
