        "description": "Hooray! Polycarp turned \n    n\n years old! The Technocup Team sincerely\ncongratulates Polycarp! Polycarp celebrated all of his \n    n\n birthdays: from\nthe \n    1\n-th to the \n    n\n-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many\ntimes he turned beautiful number of years? According to Polycarp, a positive\ninteger is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more\ntimes. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: \n    1\n, \n    77\n,\n\n    777\n, \n    44\n and \n    999999\n. The following numbers are not beautiful:\n\n    12\n, \n    11110\n, \n    6969\n and \n    987654321\n. Of course, Polycarpus\nuses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10). Help Polycarpus to find\nthe number of numbers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n (inclusive) that are beautiful.\nInput The first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. Each\ntest case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 how many years Polycarp has turned. Output\nPrint \n    t\n integers \u2014 the answers to the given test cases in the order they\nare written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful\nyears between \n    1\n and \n    n\n, inclusive. Example Input 6 18 1 9 100500 33\n1000000000 Output 10 1 9 45 12 81 Note In the first test case of the example\nbeautiful years are \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    3\n, \n    4\n, \n    5\n, \n    6\n,\n\n    7\n, \n    8\n, \n    9\n and \n    11\n.\n\n",
