A student that failed to answer all\nquestions on the game theory exam is given one more chance by his professor.\nThe student has to play a game with the professor. The game is played on a\nsquare field consisting of n \u00d7 n cells. Initially all cells are empty. On each\nturn a player chooses and paint an empty cell that has no common sides with\npreviously painted cells. Adjacent corner of painted cells is allowed. On the\nnext turn another player does the same, then the first one and so on. The\nplayer with no cells to paint on his turn loses. The professor have chosen the\nfield size n and allowed the student to choose to be the first or the second\nplayer in the game. What should the student choose to win the game? Both\nplayers play optimally. Input The only line of the input contains one integer\nn (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^18) \u2014 the size of the field. Output Output number 1, if the\nplayer making the first turn wins when both players play optimally, otherwise\nprint number 2. Examples Input 1 Output 1 Input 2 Output 2\n\n",
