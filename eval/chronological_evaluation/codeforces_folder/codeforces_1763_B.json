        "description": "To destroy humanity, The Monster Association sent \n    n\n monsters to Earth's\nsurface. The \n    i\n-th monster has health \n    h_i\n and power \n    p_i\n. With\nhis last resort attack, True Spiral Incineration Cannon, Genos can deal\n\n    k\n damage to all monsters alive. In other words, Genos can reduce the\nhealth of all monsters by \n    k\n (if \n    k > 0\n) with a single attack.\nHowever, after every attack Genos makes, the monsters advance. With their\ncombined efforts, they reduce Genos' attack damage by the power of the\n\n    ^\n    \u2020\nweakest monster \n    ^\nalive. In other words, the\nminimum \n    p_i\n among all currently living monsters is subtracted from the\nvalue of \n    k\n after each attack. \n    ^\n    \u2020\nThe Weakest monster is the\none with the least power. \n    ^\nA monster is alive if its health is\nstrictly greater than \n    0\n. Will Genos be successful in killing all the\nmonsters? Input The first line of the input contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\ntest cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers,\n\n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, k \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of monsters\nand Genos' initial attack damage. Then two lines follow, each containing\n\n    n\n integers describing the arrays \n    h\n and \n    p\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 h_i,\n    p_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It's guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print\nthe answer \u2014 \"YES\" (without quotes) if Genos could kill all monsters and \"NO\"\notherwise. Example Input 3 6 7 18 5 13 9 10 1 2 7 2 1 2 6 3 4 5 5 5 4 4 4 3 2\n2 1 3 1 1 1 Output YES NO YES Note In the first example, after Genos' first\nattack, \n    h\n and \n    k\n will update to: \n    h: [11,0,6,2,3,0]\n \n    k: 7-1\n    = 6\n After second attack: \n    h: [5,0,0,0,0,0]\n \n    k: 6-2 = 4\n After\nthird attack: \n    h: [1,0,0,0,0,0]\n \n    k: 4-2 = 2\n After fourth attack:\n\n    h: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n As Genos could kill all monsters, the answer is YES.\n\n",
