        "description": "Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.\nYou are given a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting of lowercase\nEnglish letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks\nwith lowercase English letters in such a way that a string \"abacaba\" occurs as\na substring in a resulting string exactly once? Each question mark should be\nreplaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string\n\"a?b?c\" can be transformed into strings \"aabbc\" and \"azbzc\", but can't be\ntransformed into strings \"aabc\", \"a?bbc\" and \"babbc\". Occurrence of a string\n\n    t\n of length \n    m\n in the string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n as a\nsubstring is a index \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n - m + 1\n) such that\nstring \n    s[i..i+m-1]\n consisting of \n    m\n consecutive symbols of \n    s\n\nstarting from \n    i\n-th equals to string \n    t\n. For example string \"ababa\"\nhas two occurrences of a string \"aba\" as a substring with \n    i = 1\n and \n    i\n    = 3\n, but there are no occurrences of a string \"aba\" in the string \"acba\" as\na substring. Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all\nquestion marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string\n\"abacaba\" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once. Input\nFirst line of input contains an integer \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264\n    5000\n), number of test cases. \n    T\n pairs of lines with test case\ndescriptions follow. The first line of a test case description contains a\nsingle integer \n    n\n (\n    7 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n), length of a string\n\n    s\n. The second line of a test case description contains string \n    s\n of\nlength \n    n\n consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.\nOutput For each test case output an answer for it. In case if there is no way\nto replace question marks in string \n    s\n with a lowercase English letters\nin such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string \"abacaba\" in\nthe resulting string as a substring output \"No\". Otherwise output \"Yes\" and in\nthe next line output a resulting string consisting of \n    n\n lowercase\nEnglish letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any. You may\nprint every letter in \"Yes\" and \"No\" in any case you want (so, for example,\nthe strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).\nExample Input 6 7 abacaba 7 ??????? 11 aba?abacaba 11 abacaba?aba 15\nasdf???f???qwer 11 abacabacaba Output Yes abacaba Yes abacaba Yes abadabacaba\nYes abacabadaba No No Note In first example there is exactly one occurrence of\na string \"abacaba\" in the string \"abacaba\" as a substring. In second example\nseven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters\nand with \"abacaba\" in particular. In sixth example there are two occurrences\nof a string \"abacaba\" as a substring.\n\n",
