        "description": "This time the Berland Team Olympiad in Informatics is held in a remote city\nthat can only be reached by one small bus. Bus has n passenger seats, seat i\ncan be occupied only by a participant from the city ai. Today the bus has\ncompleted m trips, each time bringing n participants. The participants were\nthen aligned in one line in the order they arrived, with people from the same\nbus standing in the order of their seats (i. e. if we write down the cities\nwhere the participants came from, we get the sequence a1, a2, ..., an repeated\nm times). After that some teams were formed, each consisting of k participants\nform the same city standing next to each other in the line. Once formed, teams\nleft the line. The teams were formed until there were no k neighboring\nparticipants from the same city. Help the organizers determine how many\nparticipants have left in the line after that process ended. We can prove that\nanswer doesn't depend on the order in which teams were selected. Input The\nfirst line contains three integers n, k and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264\nm \u2264 10^9). The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264\n10^5), where ai is the number of city, person from which must take seat i in\nthe bus. Output Output the number of remaining participants in the line.\nExamples Input 4 2 5 1 2 3 1 Output 12 Input 1 9 10 1 Output 1 Input 3 2 10 1\n2 1 Output 0 Note In the second example, the line consists of ten participants\nfrom the same city. Nine of them will form a team. At the end, only one\nparticipant will stay in the line.\n\n",
