        "description": "Today is Wednesday, the third day of the week. What's more interesting is that\ntomorrow is the last day of the year 2015. Limak is a little polar bear. He\nenjoyed this year a lot. Now, he is so eager to the coming year 2016. Limak\nwants to prove how responsible a bear he is. He is going to regularly save\ncandies for the entire year 2016! He considers various saving plans. He can\nsave one candy either on some fixed day of the week or on some fixed day of\nthe month. Limak chose one particular plan. He isn't sure how many candies he\nwill save in the 2016 with his plan. Please, calculate it and tell him. Input\nThe only line of the input is in one of the following two formats: \"x of week\"\nwhere x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 7) denotes the day of the week. The 1-st day is Monday and\nthe 7-th one is Sunday. \"x of month\" where x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 31) denotes the day of\nthe month. Output Print one integer \u2014 the number of candies Limak will save in\nthe year 2016. Examples Input 4 of week Output 52 Input 30 of month Output 11\nNote Polar bears use the Gregorian calendar. It is the most common calendar\nand you likely use it too. You can read about it on Wikipedia if you want to \u2013\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar. The week starts with Monday.\nIn the first sample Limak wants to save one candy on each Thursday (the 4-th\nday of the week). There are 52 Thursdays in the 2016. Thus, he will save 52\ncandies in total. In the second sample Limak wants to save one candy on the\n30-th day of each month. There is the 30-th day in exactly 11 months in the\n2016 \u2014 all months but February. It means that Limak will save 11 candies in\ntotal.\n\n",
