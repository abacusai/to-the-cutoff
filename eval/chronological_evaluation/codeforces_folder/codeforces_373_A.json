        "description": "Cucumber boy is fan of Kyubeat, a famous music game. Kyubeat has 16 panels for\nplaying arranged in 4 \u00d7 4 table. When a panel lights up, he has to press that\npanel. Each panel has a timing to press (the preffered time when a player\nshould press it), and Cucumber boy is able to press at most k panels in a time\nwith his one hand. Cucumber boy is trying to press all panels in perfect\ntiming, that is he wants to press each panel exactly in its preffered time. If\nhe cannot press the panels with his two hands in perfect timing, his challenge\nto press all the panels in perfect timing will fail. You are given one scene\nof Kyubeat's panel from the music Cucumber boy is trying. Tell him is he able\nto press all the panels in perfect timing. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 5) \u2014 the number of panels Cucumber boy can press\nwith his one hand. Next 4 lines contain 4 characters each (digits from 1 to 9,\nor period) \u2014 table of panels. If a digit i was written on the panel, it means\nthe boy has to press that panel in time i. If period was written on the panel,\nhe doesn't have to press that panel. Output Output \"YES\" (without quotes), if\nhe is able to press all the panels in perfect timing. If not, output \"NO\"\n(without quotes). Examples Input 1 .135 1247 3468 5789 Output YES Input 5 ..1.\n1111 ..1. ..1. Output YES Input 1 .... 12.1 .2.. .2.. Output NO Note In the\nthird sample boy cannot press all panels in perfect timing. He can press all\nthe panels in timing in time 1, but he cannot press the panels in time 2 in\ntiming with his two hands.\n\n",
