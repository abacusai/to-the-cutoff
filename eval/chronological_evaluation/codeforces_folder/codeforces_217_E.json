        "description": "Professor Bajtocy is conducting experiments on alien DNA. He has discovered\nthat it is subject to repetitive mutations \u2014 each mutation happens in the same\nway: some continuous subsequence of the alien DNA becomes active, copies\nitself, the copy gets mangled and inserts itself right after the original\nsubsequence. The mangled copy of the activated continuous subsequence is\nformed by first joining all the elements at the even positions in that\nsubsequence, and then joining all the elements at the odd ones at the end.\nThat is, if the activated subsequence consists of 11 elements and represented\nas s1s2... s11, its mangled copy is s2s4s6s8s10s1s3s5s7s9s11. For example, if\nthe original sequence was \"ACTGG\" and the mutation happened on the segment [2,\n4] (that is the activated subsequence is \"CTG\"), the mutated DNA is:\n\"ACTGTCGG\". The mangled copy of the activated subsequence is marked with bold\nfont. Professor Bajtocy has written down the original DNA sequence and the\nmutations that sequentially happened to it, and he now asks you to recover the\nfirst k elements of the DNA sequence after all the mutations. Input The first\nline of input contains the original DNA sequence, consisting only of letters\n\"A\", \"C\", \"T\" and \"G\" and not exceeding 3\u00b710^6 in length. The second line\ncontains a single integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 3\u00b710^6). The third line contains a single\ninteger n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 5000) \u2014 the number of mutations. The next n lines describe\nthe mutations in chronological order \u2014 each mutation is described by two\nnumbers li and ri (1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 10^9), meaning that the continuous\nsubsequence [li, ri] has become active and cloned itself, joining itself with\nthe mangled copy. It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, that is, no\nmutation acts on non-existing elements of the DNA sequence, and the resulting\nDNA sequence has at least k elements. Assume that the DNA elements are indexed\nstarting from 1 and that the notation [l, r] meaning the continuous\nsubsequence of DNA sequence that consists of r - l + 1 elements starting at\nthe l-th DNA sequence element and ending at the r-th DNA sequence element.\nOutput Output a single line, containing the first k letters of the mutated DNA\nsequence. Examples Input GAGA 4 0 Output GAGA Input ACGTACGT 16 2 1 2 2 8\nOutput ACCAGTACCGACATCG Note In the second example, after the first mutation\nthe sequence is \"ACCAGTACGT\". After the second mutation it's\n\"ACCAGTACCGACATCGT\".\n\n",
