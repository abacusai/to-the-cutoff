        "description": "It is known that there are k fish species in the polar ocean, numbered from 1\nto k. They are sorted by non-decreasing order of their weight, which is a\npositive number. Let the weight of the i-th type of fish be wi, then 0 < w1 \u2264\nw2 \u2264 ... \u2264 wk holds. Polar bears Alice and Bob each have caught some fish, and\nthey are guessing who has the larger sum of weight of the fish he/she's\ncaught. Given the type of the fish they've caught, determine whether it is\npossible that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger total weight than\nBob's. In other words, does there exist a sequence of weights wi (not\nnecessary integers), such that the fish caught by Alice has a strictly larger\ntotal weight? Input The first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264\n10^5, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of fish caught by Alice and Bob respectively,\nand the number of fish species. The second line contains n integers each from\n1 to k, the list of fish type caught by Alice. The third line contains m\nintegers each from 1 to k, the list of fish type caught by Bob. Note that one\nmay have caught more than one fish for a same species. Output Output \"YES\"\n(without quotes) if it is possible, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\nExamples Input 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 3 Output YES Input 4 7 9 5 2 7 3 3 5 2 7 3 8 7\nOutput NO Note In the first sample, if w1 = 1, w2 = 2, w3 = 2.5, then Alice\nhas a total of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 weight units, while Bob only has 1 + 1 + 2.5 =\n4.5. In the second sample, the fish that Alice caught is a subset of Bob's.\nTherefore, the total weight of Bob\u2019s fish is always not less than the total\nweight of Alice\u2019s fish.\n\n",
