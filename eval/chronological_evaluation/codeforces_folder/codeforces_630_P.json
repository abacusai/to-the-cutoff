        "description": "It was decided in IT City to distinguish successes of local IT companies by\nawards in the form of stars covered with gold from one side. To order the\nstars it is necessary to estimate order cost that depends on the area of gold-\nplating. Write a program that can calculate the area of a star. A \"star\"\nfigure having n \u2265 5 corners where n is a prime number is constructed the\nfollowing way. On the circle of radius r n points are selected so that the\ndistances between the adjacent ones are equal. Then every point is connected\nby a segment with two maximally distant points. All areas bounded by the\nsegments parts are the figure parts. Input The only line of the input contains\ntwo integers n (5 \u2264 n < 10^9, n is prime) and r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of\nthe star corners and the radius of the circumcircle correspondingly. Output\nOutput one number \u2014 the star area. The relative error of your answer should\nnot be greater than 10^-7. Examples Input 7 10 Output 108.395919545675\n\n",
