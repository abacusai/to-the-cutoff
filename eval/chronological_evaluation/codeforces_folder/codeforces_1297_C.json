        "description": "Polycarp is the project manager in the IT-company. Right now, he needs to\nchoose developers for his team to start a new project. The company has \n    n\n\ndevelopers \"on the bench\" (i.e not involved in other projects). Polycarp\nassessed the skills of each of them: \n    a_i\n (\n    -10^4 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 an integer characteristic of the \n    i\n-th developer. This value\ncan be either positive, zero or even negative (some developers cause\ndistractions). After Polycarp chooses a subset of developers for his team, the\nstrength of the team will be determined by the sum of \n    a_i\n values for all\nselected developers. Polycarp fears that if he chooses a team in such a way\nthat maximizes the sum of the characteristics of \n    a_i\n, other managers may\nfind this unacceptable. For this reason, he plans to create such a team that\nthe sum of the \n    a_i\n values for it is strictly less than the maximum\npossible value. Help Polycarp choose any team that: the sum of the\ncharacteristics \n    a_i\n for all members of the selected team is strictly\nless than the maximum value that can be achieved by choosing the team in some\nother way and at the same time, the sum of the characteristics of \n    a_i\n\nfor all members of the selected team is the greatest possible. If, following\nthe requirements above, you can select a team in several ways, then just find\nany of them. It's guaranteed that the sum of the characteristics in the\ndesired subset is strictly positive (i.e. Polycarp can always choose a non-\nempty team). Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow.\nEach test case begins with a line containing one integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of developers \"on the bench\". The second line of a\ntest case contains a sequence of integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n\n(\n    -10^4 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the characteristics of the \n    n\n\ndevelopers. It is guaranteed that the characteristics are such that the sum of\nthe characteristics in the answer is strictly positive. It is guaranteed that\nthe sum of \n    n\n over all test cases in the input doesn't exceed \n    10^5\n.\nOutput Print the answers for the given \n    t\n test cases in the order that\nthey appear in the input. In the first line of each answer, print a positive\ninteger \n    s\n \u2014 the sum of the characteristics in the desired subset. The\nsecond line should contain only the characters 0 and 1 and match the answer:\nthe character in the \n    i\n-th position should be equal to 1 if the\n\n    i\n-th developer belongs to the team; the character in the \n    i\n-th\nposition should be equal to 0 if the \n    i\n-th developer does not belong to\nthe team. If there are several answers, print any of them. Example Input 5 5 1\n-1 1 -1 1 2 11 1 3 5 -3 4 3 5 3 -4 5 -1 0 3 -3 0 Output 2 11101 11 10 6 111 5\n100 2 10100 Note In the first test case, the maximum subset \n    a_1, a_3,\n    a_5\n has a sum equal to \n    3\n, so Polycarp should choose a team with the\nmaximum total sum which is less than \n    3\n. In the second test case, the\nmaximum subset \n    a_1, a_2\n has a sum equal to \n    12\n, so Polycarp should\nchoose a team with the maximum total sum which is less than \n    12\n. In the\nthird test case, the maximum subset \n    a_1, a_3\n has a sum equal to \n    9\n.\nIn the fourth test case, the maximum subset \n    a_1, a_2\n has a sum equal to\n\n    8\n. In the fifth test case, there are several subsets with a maximum sum\nequal to \n    3\n, so Polycarp should choose a team with a lower total sum.\n\n",
