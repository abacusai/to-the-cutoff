        "description": "A class of students got bored wearing the same pair of shoes every day, so\nthey decided to shuffle their shoes among themselves. In this problem, a pair\nof shoes is inseparable and is considered as a single object. There are\n\n    n\n students in the class, and you are given an array \n    s\n in non-\ndecreasing order, where \n    s_i\n is the shoe size of the \n    i\n-th student.\nA shuffling of shoes is valid only if no student gets their own shoes and if\nevery student gets shoes of size greater than or equal to their size. You have\nto output a permutation \n    p\n of \n    1,2,\n    \u2026,n\n denoting a\nvalid shuffling of shoes, where the \n    i\n-th student gets the shoes of the\n\n    p_i\n-th student (\n    p_i \n     i\n). And output \n    -1\n if a valid\nshuffling does not exist. A permutation is an array consisting of \n    n\n\ndistinct integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n in arbitrary order. For example,\n\n    [2,3,1,5,4]\n is a permutation, but \n    [1,2,2]\n is not a permutation\n(\n    2\n appears twice in the array) and \n    [1,3,4]\n is also not a\npermutation (\n    n=3\n but there is \n    4\n in the array). Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the\ntest cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u226410^5\n) \u2014 the number of students. The second line\nof each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    s_1, s_2,\n    \u2026,s_n\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 s_i\n    \u226410^9\n, and for all \n    1\n    \u2264 i<n\n, \n    s_i\n    \u2264\n    s_i+1\n) \u2014 the shoe sizes of the students. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test\ncase, print the answer in a single line using the following format. If a valid\nshuffling does not exist, print the number \n    -1\n as the answer. If a valid\nshuffling exists, print \n    n\n space-separated integers \u2014 a permutation\n\n    p\n of \n    1,2,\n    \u2026,n\n denoting a valid shuffling of shoes where the\n\n    i\n-th student gets the shoes of the \n    p_i\n-th student. If there are\nmultiple answers, then print any of them. Example Input 2 5 1 1 1 1 1 6 3 6 8\n13 15 21 Output 5 1 2 3 4 -1 Note In the first test case, any permutation\n\n    p\n of \n    1,\n    \u2026,n\n where \n    p_i\n     i\n would represent a valid\nshuffling since all students have equal shoe sizes, and thus anyone can wear\nanyone's shoes. In the second test case, it can be shown that no valid\nshuffling is possible.\n\n",
