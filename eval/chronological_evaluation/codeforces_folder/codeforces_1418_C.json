        "name": "Mortal Kombat Tower",
        "description": "You and your friend are playing the game Mortal Kombat XI. You are trying to\npass a challenge tower. There are \n    n\n bosses in this tower, numbered from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n. The type of the \n    i\n-th boss is \n    a_i\n. If the\n\n    i\n-th boss is easy then its type is \n    a_i = 0\n, otherwise this boss is\nhard and its type is \n    a_i = 1\n. During one session, either you or your\nfriend can kill one or two bosses (neither you nor your friend can skip the\nsession, so the minimum number of bosses killed during one session is at least\none). After your friend session, your session begins, then again your friend\nsession begins, your session begins, and so on. The first session is your\nfriend's session. Your friend needs to get good because he can't actually kill\nhard bosses. To kill them, he uses skip points. One skip point can be used to\nkill one hard boss. Your task is to find the minimum number of skip points\nyour friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all \n    n\n bosses in the\ngiven order. For example: suppose \n    n = 8\n, \n    a = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1,\n    1]\n. Then the best course of action is the following: your friend kills two\nfirst bosses, using one skip point for the first boss; you kill the third and\nthe fourth bosses; your friend kills the fifth boss; you kill the sixth and\nthe seventh bosses; your friend kills the last boss, using one skip point, so\nthe tower is completed using two skip points. You have to answer \n    t\n\nindependent test cases. Input The first line of the input contains one integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThen \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of the test case contains one\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of bosses.\nThe second line of the test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 1\n), where \n    a_i\n is the type of\nthe \n    i\n-th boss. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n does not exceed\n\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n (\n    \u2211 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). Output For each\ntest case, print the answer: the minimum number of skip points your friend\nneeds to use so you and your friend kill all \n    n\n bosses in the given\norder.
