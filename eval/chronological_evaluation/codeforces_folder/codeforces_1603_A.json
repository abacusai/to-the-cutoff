        "description": "YouKn0wWho has an integer sequence \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n. He will\nperform the following operation until the sequence becomes empty: select an\nindex \n    i\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 |a|\n and \n    a_i\n is not\ndivisible by \n    (i + 1)\n, and erase this element from the sequence. Here\n\n    |a|\n is the length of sequence \n    a\n at the moment of operation. Note\nthat the sequence \n    a\n changes and the next operation is performed on this\nchanged sequence. For example, if \n    a=[3,5,4,5]\n, then he can select \n    i =\n    2\n, because \n    a_2 = 5\n is not divisible by \n    i+1 = 3\n. After this\noperation the sequence is \n    [3,4,5]\n. Help YouKn0wWho determine if it is\npossible to erase the whole sequence using the aforementioned operation. Input\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The second\nline of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over\nall test cases doesn't exceed \n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case,\nprint \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible to erase the whole sequence\nusing the aforementioned operation, print \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. You\ncan print each letter in any register (upper or lower).
