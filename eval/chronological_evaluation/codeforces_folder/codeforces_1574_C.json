        "description": "Recently, Petya learned about a new game \"Slay the Dragon\". As the name\nsuggests, the player will have to fight with dragons. To defeat a dragon, you\nhave to kill it and defend your castle. To do this, the player has a squad of\n\n    n\n heroes, the strength of the \n    i\n-th hero is equal to \n    a_i\n.\nAccording to the rules of the game, exactly one hero should go kill the\ndragon, all the others will defend the castle. If the dragon's defense is\nequal to \n    x\n, then you have to send a hero with a strength of at least\n\n    x\n to kill it. If the dragon's attack power is \n    y\n, then the total\nstrength of the heroes defending the castle should be at least \n    y\n. The\nplayer can increase the strength of any hero by \n    1\n for one gold coin.\nThis operation can be done any number of times. There are \n    m\n dragons in\nthe game, the \n    i\n-th of them has defense equal to \n    x_i\n and attack\npower equal to \n    y_i\n. Petya was wondering what is the minimum number of\ncoins he needs to spend to defeat the \n    i\n-th dragon. Note that the task is\nsolved independently for each dragon (improvements are not saved). Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 number of heroes. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^12\n), where \n    a_i\n is the\nstrength of the \n    i\n-th hero. The third line contains a single integer\n\n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of dragons. The\nnext \n    m\n lines contain two integers each, \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 10^12; 1 \n    \u2264 y_i \n    \u2264 10^18\n) \u2014 defense and attack\npower of the \n    i\n-th dragon. Output Print \n    m\n lines, \n    i\n-th of\nwhich contains a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of coins that should be\nspent to defeat the \n    i\n-th dragon. Example Input 4 3 6 2 3 5 3 12 7 9 4 14\n1 10 8 7 Output 1 2 4 0 2 Note To defeat the first dragon, you can increase\nthe strength of the third hero by \n    1\n, then the strength of the heroes\nwill be equal to \n    [3, 6, 3, 3]\n. To kill the dragon, you can choose the\nfirst hero. To defeat the second dragon, you can increase the forces of the\nsecond and third heroes by \n    1\n, then the strength of the heroes will be\nequal to \n    [3, 7, 3, 3]\n. To kill the dragon, you can choose a second hero.\nTo defeat the third dragon, you can increase the strength of all the heroes by\n\n    1\n, then the strength of the heroes will be equal to \n    [4, 7, 3, 4]\n.\nTo kill the dragon, you can choose a fourth hero. To defeat the fourth dragon,\nyou don't need to improve the heroes and choose a third hero to kill the\ndragon. To defeat the fifth dragon, you can increase the strength of the\nsecond hero by \n    2\n, then the strength of the heroes will be equal to\n\n    [3, 8, 2, 3]\n. To kill the dragon, you can choose a second hero.\n\n",
