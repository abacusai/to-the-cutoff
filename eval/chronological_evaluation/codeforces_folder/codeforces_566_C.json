        "description": "Some country consists of n cities, connected by a railroad network. The\ntransport communication of the country is so advanced that the network\nconsists of a minimum required number of (n - 1) bidirectional roads (in the\nother words, the graph of roads is a tree). The i-th road that directly\nconnects cities ai and bi, has the length of li kilometers. The transport\nnetwork is served by a state transporting company FRR (Fabulous Rail Roads).\nIn order to simplify the price policy, it offers a single ride fare on the\ntrain. In order to follow the route of length t kilometers, you need to pay\nburles. Note that it is forbidden to split a long route into short segments\nand pay them separately (a special railroad police, or RRP, controls that the\nlaw doesn't get violated). A Large Software Company decided to organize a\nprogramming tournament. Having conducted several online rounds, the company\nemployees determined a list of finalists and sent it to the logistical\ndepartment to find a place where to conduct finals. The Large Software Company\ncan easily organize the tournament finals in any of the n cities of the\ncountry, so the the main factor in choosing the city for the last stage of the\ntournament is the total cost of buying tickets for all the finalists. We know\nthat the i-th city of the country has wi cup finalists living there. Help the\ncompany employees find the city such that the total cost of travel of all the\nparticipants to it is minimum. Input The first line of the input contains\nnumber n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number of cities in the country. The next\nline contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn (0 \u2264 wi \u2264 10^8) \u2014 the number of\nfinalists living in each city of the country. Next (n - 1) lines contain the\ndescriptions of the railroad, the i-th line contains three integers, ai, bi,\nli (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 n, ai \u2260 bi, 1 \u2264 li \u2264 1000). Output Print two numbers \u2014 an\ninteger f that is the number of the optimal city to conduct the competition,\nand the real number c, equal to the minimum total cost of transporting all the\nfinalists to the competition. Your answer will be considered correct if two\nconditions are fulfilled at the same time: The absolute or relative error of\nthe printed number c in comparison with the cost of setting up a final in city\nf doesn't exceed 10^-6; Absolute or relative error of the printed number c in\ncomparison to the answer of the jury doesn't exceed 10^-6. If there are\nmultiple answers, you are allowed to print any of them. Examples Input 5 3 1 2\n6 5 1 2 3 2 3 1 4 3 9 5 3 1 Output 3 192.0 Input 2 5 5 1 2 2 Output 1\n14.142135623730951000 Note In the sample test an optimal variant of choosing a\ncity to conduct the finals of the competition is 3. At such choice the cost of\nconducting is burles. In the second sample test, whatever city you would\nchoose, you will need to pay for the transport for five participants, so you\nwill need to pay burles for each one of them.\n\n",
