        "description": "There are n student groups at the university. During the study day, each group\ncan take no more than 7 classes. Seven time slots numbered from 1 to 7 are\nallocated for the classes. The schedule on Monday is known for each group, i.\ne. time slots when group will have classes are known. Your task is to\ndetermine the minimum number of rooms needed to hold classes for all groups on\nMonday. Note that one room can hold at most one group class in a single time\nslot. Input The first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the\nnumber of groups. Each of the following n lines contains a sequence consisting\nof 7 zeroes and ones \u2014 the schedule of classes on Monday for a group. If the\nsymbol in a position equals to 1 then the group has class in the corresponding\ntime slot. In the other case, the group has no class in the corresponding time\nslot. Output Print minimum number of rooms needed to hold all groups classes\non Monday. Examples Input 2 0101010 1010101 Output 1 Input 3 0101011 0011001\n0110111 Output 3 Note In the first example one room is enough. It will be\noccupied in each of the seven time slot by the first group or by the second\ngroup. In the second example three rooms is enough, because in the seventh\ntime slot all three groups have classes.\n\n",
