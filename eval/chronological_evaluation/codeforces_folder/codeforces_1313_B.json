        "description": "Nikolay has only recently started in competitive programming, but already\nqualified to the finals of one prestigious olympiad. There going to be \n    n\n\nparticipants, one of whom is Nikolay. Like any good olympiad, it consists of\ntwo rounds. Tired of the traditional rules, in which the participant who\nsolved the largest number of problems wins, the organizers came up with\ndifferent rules. Suppose in the first round participant A took \n    x\n-th\nplace and in the second round \u2014 \n    y\n-th place. Then the total score of the\nparticipant A is sum \n    x + y\n. The overall place of the participant A is\nthe number of participants (including A) having their total score less than or\nequal to the total score of A. Note, that some participants may end up having\na common overall place. It is also important to note, that in both the first\nand the second round there were no two participants tying at a common place.\nIn other words, for every \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n exactly one\nparticipant took \n    i\n-th place in first round and exactly one participant\ntook \n    i\n-th place in second round. Right after the end of the Olympiad,\nNikolay was informed that he got \n    x\n-th place in first round and\n\n    y\n-th place in the second round. Nikolay doesn't know the results of\nother participants, yet he wonders what is the minimum and maximum place he\ncan take, if we consider the most favorable and unfavorable outcome for him.\nPlease help Nikolay to find the answer to this question. Input The first line\ncontains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases to solve. Each of the following \n    t\n lines contains integers \n    n\n,\n\n    x\n, \n    y\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\nthe number of participants in the olympiad, the place that Nikolay took in the\nfirst round and the place that Nikolay took in the second round. Output Print\ntwo integers \u2014 the minimum and maximum possible overall place Nikolay could\ntake. Examples Input 1 5 1 3 Output 1 3 Input 1 6 3 4 Output 2 6 Note\nExplanation for the first example: Suppose there were 5 participants A-E.\nLet's denote Nikolay as A. The the most favorable results for Nikolay could\nlook as follows: However, the results of the Olympiad could also look like\nthis: In the first case Nikolay would have taken first place, and in the\nsecond \u2014 third place.\n\n",
