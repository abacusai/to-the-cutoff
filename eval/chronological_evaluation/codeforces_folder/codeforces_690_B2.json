        "description": "Now that Heidi has made sure her Zombie Contamination level checker works,\nit's time to strike! This time, the zombie lair is a strictly convex polygon\non the lattice. Each vertex of the polygon occupies a point on the lattice.\nFor each cell of the lattice, Heidi knows the level of Zombie Contamination \u2013\nthe number of corners of the cell that are inside or on the border of the\nlair. Given this information, Heidi wants to know the exact shape of the lair\nto rain destruction on the zombies. Help her! Input The input contains\nmultiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains one integer N,\nthe size of the lattice grid (5 \u2264 N \u2264 500). The next N lines each contain N\ncharacters, describing the level of Zombie Contamination of each cell in the\nlattice. Every character of every line is a digit between 0 and 4. Cells are\ngiven in the same order as they are shown in the picture above: rows go in the\ndecreasing value of y coordinate, and in one row cells go in the order of\nincreasing x coordinate. This means that the first row corresponds to cells\nwith coordinates (1, N), ..., (N, N) and the last row corresponds to cells\nwith coordinates (1, 1), ..., (N, 1). The last line of the file contains a\nzero. This line should not be treated as a test case. The sum of the N values\nfor all tests in one file will not exceed 5000. Output For each test case,\ngive the following output: The first line of the output should contain one\ninteger V, the number of vertices of the polygon that is the secret lair. The\nnext V lines each should contain two integers, denoting the vertices of the\npolygon in the clockwise order, starting from the lexicographically smallest\nvertex.

It is guaranteed that in the correct solution the coordinates of the\npolygon vertices are between 2 and N - 2. A vertex (x1, y1) is\nlexicographically smaller than vertex (x2, y2) if x1 < x2 or .\n\n",
