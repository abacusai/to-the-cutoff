        "description": "I guess there's not much point in reminding you that Nvodsk winters aren't\nexactly hot. That increased the popularity of the public transport\ndramatically. The route of bus 62 has exactly n stops (stop 1 goes first on\nits way and stop n goes last). The stops are positioned on a straight line and\ntheir coordinates are 0 = x1 < x2 < ... < xn. Each day exactly m people use\nbus 62. For each person we know the number of the stop where he gets on the\nbus and the number of the stop where he gets off the bus. A ticket from stop a\nto stop b (a < b) costs xb - xa rubles. However, the conductor can choose no\nmore than one segment NOT TO SELL a ticket for. We mean that conductor should\nchoose C and D (\u0421 <= D) and sell a ticket for the segments [A, C] and [D, B],\nor not sell the ticket at all. The conductor and the passenger divide the\nsaved money between themselves equally. The conductor's \"untaxed income\" is\nsometimes interrupted by inspections that take place as the bus drives on some\nsegment of the route located between two consecutive stops. The inspector\nfines the conductor by c rubles for each passenger who doesn't have the ticket\nfor this route's segment. You know the coordinated of all stops xi; the\nnumbers of stops where the i-th passenger gets on and off, ai and bi (ai <\nbi); the fine c; and also pi \u2014 the probability of inspection on segment\nbetween the i-th and the i + 1-th stop. The conductor asked you to help him\nmake a plan of selling tickets that maximizes the mathematical expectation of\nhis profit. Input The first line contains three integers n, m and c (2 \u2264 n \u2264\n150 000, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 300 000, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10 000). The next line contains n integers\nxi (0 \u2264 xi \u2264 10^9, x1 = 0, xi < xi + 1) \u2014 the coordinates of the stops on the\nbus's route. The third line contains n - 1 integer pi (0 \u2264 pi \u2264 100) \u2014 the\nprobability of inspection in percents on the segment between stop i and stop i\n+ 1. Then follow m lines that describe the bus's passengers. Each line\ncontains exactly two integers ai and bi (1 \u2264 ai < bi \u2264 n) \u2014 the numbers of\nstops where the i-th passenger gets on and off. Output Print the single real\nnumber \u2014 the maximum expectation of the conductor's profit. Your answer will\nbe considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^-6.\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b.\nThe checker program will consider your answer correct, if . Examples Input 3 3\n10 0 10 100 100 0 1 2 2 3 1 3 Output 90.000000000 Input 10 8 187 0 10 30 70\n150 310 630 1270 2550 51100 13 87 65 0 100 44 67 3 4 1 10 2 9 3 8 1 5 6 10 2 7\n4 10 4 5 Output 76859.990000000 Note A comment to the first sample: The first\nand third passengers get tickets from stop 1 to stop 2. The second passenger\ndoesn't get a ticket. There always is inspection on the segment 1-2 but both\npassengers have the ticket for it. There never is an inspection on the segment\n2-3, that's why the second passenger gets away with the cheating. Our total\nprofit is (0 + 90 / 2 + 90 / 2) = 90.\n\n",
