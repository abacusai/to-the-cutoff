        "description": "You are a rebel leader and you are planning to start a revolution in your\ncountry. But the evil Government found out about your plans and set your\npunishment in the form of correctional labor. You must paint a fence which\nconsists of \n    10^100\n planks in two colors in the following way (suppose\nplanks are numbered from left to right from \n    0\n): if the index of the\nplank is divisible by \n    r\n (such planks have indices \n    0\n, \n    r\n,\n\n    2r\n and so on) then you must paint it red; if the index of the plank is\ndivisible by \n    b\n (such planks have indices \n    0\n, \n    b\n, \n    2b\n and\nso on) then you must paint it blue; if the index is divisible both by \n    r\n\nand \n    b\n you can choose the color to paint the plank; otherwise, you don't\nneed to paint the plank at all (and it is forbidden to spent paint on it).\nFurthermore, the Government added one additional restriction to make your\npunishment worse. Let's list all painted planks of the fence in ascending\norder: if there are \n    k\n consecutive planks with the same color in this\nlist, then the Government will state that you failed the labor and execute you\nimmediately. If you don't paint the fence according to the four aforementioned\nconditions, you will also be executed. The question is: will you be able to\naccomplish the labor (the time is not important) or the execution is\nunavoidable and you need to escape at all costs. Input The first line contains\nsingle integer \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. The next \n    T\n lines contain descriptions of test cases \u2014 one per\nline. Each test case contains three integers \n    r\n, \n    b\n, \n    k\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 r, b \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    2 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the corresponding\ncoefficients. Output Print \n    T\n words \u2014 one per line. For each test case\nprint REBEL (case insensitive) if the execution is unavoidable or OBEY (case\ninsensitive) otherwise. Example Input 4 1 1 2 2 10 4 5 2 3 3 2 2 Output OBEY\nREBEL OBEY OBEY\n\n",
