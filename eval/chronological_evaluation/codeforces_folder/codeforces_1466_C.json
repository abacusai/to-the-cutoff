        "description": "After his wife's tragic death, Eurydice, Orpheus descended to the realm of\ndeath to see her. Reaching its gates was uneasy, but passing through them\nproved to be even more challenging. Mostly because of Cerberus, the three-\nheaded hound of Hades. Orpheus, a famous poet, and musician plans to calm\nCerberus with his poetry and safely walk past him. He created a very peculiar\npoem for Cerberus. It consists only of lowercase English letters. We call a\npoem's substring a palindrome if and only if it reads the same backwards and\nforwards. A string \n    a\n is a substring of a string \n    b\n if \n    a\n can\nbe obtained from \n    b\n by deleting several (possibly zero or all) characters\nfrom the beginning and several (possibly zero or all) characters from the end.\nUnfortunately, Cerberus dislikes palindromes of length greater than \n    1\n.\nFor example in the poem abaa the hound of Hades wouldn't like substrings aba\nand aa. Orpheus can only calm Cerberus if the hound likes his poetry. That's\nwhy he wants to change his poem so that it does not contain any palindrome\nsubstrings of length greater than \n    1\n. Orpheus can modify the poem by\nreplacing a letter at any position with any lowercase English letter. He can\nuse this operation arbitrarily many times (possibly zero). Since there can be\nmany palindromes in his poem, he may have to make some corrections. But how\nmany, exactly? Given the poem, determine the minimal number of letters that\nhave to be changed so that the poem does not contain any palindromes of length\ngreater than \n    1\n. Input The first line of the input contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) denoting the number of test\ncases, then \n    t\n test cases follow. The first and only line of each test\ncase contains a non-empty string of lowercase English letters, Orpheus' poem.\nThe sum of the length of Orpheus' poems in all test cases will not exceed\n\n    10^5\n. Output You should output \n    t\n lines, \n    i\n-th line should\ncontain a single integer, answer to the \n    i\n-th test case. Example Input 7\nbabba abaac codeforces zeroorez abcdcba bbbbbbb a Output 1 1 0 1 1 4 0 Note In\nthe first test case, we can replace the third character with c and obtain a\npalindrome-less poem bacba. In the second test case, we can replace the third\ncharacter with d and obtain a palindrome-less poem abdac. In the third test\ncase, the initial poem already doesn't contain any palindromes, so Orpheus\ndoesn't need to change anything there.\n\n",
