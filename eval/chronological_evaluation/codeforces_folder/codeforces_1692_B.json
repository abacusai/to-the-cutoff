        "description": "Sho has an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n integers. An operation consists\nof choosing two distinct indices \n    i\n and \n    j\n and removing \n    a_i\n\nand \n    a_j\n from the array. For example, for the array \n    [2, 3, 4, 2,\n    5]\n, Sho can choose to remove indices \n    1\n and \n    3\n. After this\noperation, the array becomes \n    [3, 2, 5]\n. Note that after any operation,\nthe length of the array is reduced by two. After he made some operations, Sho\nhas an array that has only distinct elements. In addition, he made operations\nsuch that the resulting array is the longest possible. More formally, the\narray after Sho has made his operations respects these criteria: No pairs such\nthat (\n    i < j\n) and \n    a_i = a_j\n exist. The length of \n    a\n is\nmaximized. Output the length of the final array. Input The first line contains\na single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the length of the array. The second line of\neach test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the elements of the array. Output For each test case, output a\nsingle integer \u2014 the length of the final array. Remember that in the final\narray, all elements are different, and its length is maximum. Example Input 4\n6 2 2 2 3 3 3 5 9 1 9 9 1 4 15 16 16 15 4 10 100 1000 10000 Output 2 1 2 4\nNote For the first test case Sho can perform operations as follows: Choose\nindices \n    1\n and \n    5\n to remove. The array becomes \n    [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n    \n    \u2192 [2, 2, 3, 3]\n. Choose indices \n    1\n and \n    4\n to remove.\nThe array becomes \n    [2, 2, 3, 3] \n    \u2192 [2, 3]\n. The final array has\na length of \n    2\n, so the answer is \n    2\n. It can be proven that Sho\ncannot obtain an array with a longer length.For the second test case Sho can\nperform operations as follows: Choose indices \n    3\n and \n    4\n to remove.\nThe array becomes \n    [9, 1, 9, 9, 1] \n    \u2192 [9, 1, 1]\n. Choose\nindices \n    1\n and \n    3\n to remove. The array becomes \n    [9, 1, 1]\n    \n    \u2192 [1]\n. The final array has a length of \n    1\n, so the answer\nis \n    1\n. It can be proven that Sho cannot obtain an array with a longer\nlength.\n\n",
