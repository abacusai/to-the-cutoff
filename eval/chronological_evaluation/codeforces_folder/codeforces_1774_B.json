        "description": "Cirno_9baka has a paper tape with \n    n\n cells in a row on it. As he thinks\nthat the blank paper tape is too dull, he wants to paint these cells with\n\n    m\n kinds of colors. For some aesthetic reasons, he thinks that the\n\n    i\n-th color must be used exactly \n    a_i\n times, and for every \n    k\n\nconsecutive cells, their colors have to be distinct. Help Cirno_9baka to\nfigure out if there is such a way to paint the cells. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of\neach test case contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    m \n    \u2264 n\n).\nHere \n    n\n denotes the number of cells, \n    m\n denotes the number of\ncolors, and \n    k\n means that for every \n    k\n consecutive cells, their\ncolors have to be distinct. The second line of each test case contains \n    m\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u22ef , a_m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the\nnumbers of times that colors have to be used. It's guaranteed that \n    a_1 +\n    a_2 + \n    \u2026 + a_m = n\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    m\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output \"YES\"\nif there is at least one possible coloring scheme; otherwise, output \"NO\". You\nmay print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", and \"yEs\"\nwill all be recognized as positive answers). Example Input 2 12 6 2 1 1 1 1 1\n7 12 6 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Output NO YES Note In the first test case, there is no\nway to color the cells satisfying all the conditions. In the second test case,\nwe can color the cells as follows: \n    (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 6)\n.\nFor any \n    2\n consecutive cells, their colors are distinct.\n\n",
