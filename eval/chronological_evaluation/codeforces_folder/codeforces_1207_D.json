        "description": "You are given a sequence of \n    n\n pairs of integers: \n    (a_1, b_1), (a_2,\n    b_2), \n    \u2026 , (a_n, b_n)\n. This sequence is called bad if it is sorted in\nnon-descending order by first elements or if it is sorted in non-descending\norder by second elements. Otherwise the sequence is good. There are examples\nof good and bad sequences: \n    s = [(1, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1)]\n is bad because\nthe sequence of first elements is sorted: \n    [1, 3, 3]\n; \n    s = [(1, 2), (3,\n    2), (1, 2)]\n is bad because the sequence of second elements is sorted:\n\n    [2, 2, 2]\n; \n    s = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]\n is bad because both\nsequences (the sequence of first elements and the sequence of second elements)\nare sorted; \n    s = [(1, 3), (3, 3), (2, 2)]\n is good because neither the\nsequence of first elements \n    ([1, 3, 2])\n nor the sequence of second\nelements \n    ([3, 3, 2])\n is sorted. Calculate the number of permutations of\nsize \n    n\n such that after applying this permutation to the sequence \n    s\n\nit turns into a good sequence. A permutation \n    p\n of size \n    n\n is a\nsequence \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026 , p_n\n consisting of \n    n\n distinct integers\nfrom \n    1\n to \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n). If you apply permutation\n\n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026 , p_n\n to the sequence \n    s_1, s_2, \n    \u2026 , s_n\n\nyou get the sequence \n    s_p_1, s_p_2, \n    \u2026 , s_p_n\n. For example,\nif \n    s = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]\n and \n    p = [2, 3, 1]\n then \n    s\n\nturns into \n    [(1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2)]\n. Input The first line contains one\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The next \n    n\n lines\ncontains description of sequence \n    s\n. The \n    i\n-th line contains two\nintegers \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the first\nand second elements of \n    i\n-th pair in the sequence. The sequence \n    s\n\nmay contain equal elements. Output Print the number of permutations of size\n\n    n\n such that after applying this permutation to the sequence \n    s\n it\nturns into a good sequence. Print the answer modulo \n    998244353\n (a prime\nnumber). Examples Input 3 1 1 2 2 3 1 Output 3 Input 4 2 3 2 2 2 1 2 4 Output\n0 Input 3 1 1 1 1 2 3 Output 4 Note In first test case there are six\npermutations of size \n    3\n: if \n    p = [1, 2, 3]\n, then \n    s = [(1, 1), (2,\n    2), (3, 1)]\n \u2014 bad sequence (sorted by first elements); if \n    p = [1, 3,\n    2]\n, then \n    s = [(1, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2)]\n \u2014 bad sequence (sorted by\nsecond elements); if \n    p = [2, 1, 3]\n, then \n    s = [(2, 2), (1, 1), (3,\n    1)]\n \u2014 good sequence; if \n    p = [2, 3, 1]\n, then \n    s = [(2, 2), (3, 1),\n    (1, 1)]\n \u2014 good sequence; if \n    p = [3, 1, 2]\n, then \n    s = [(3, 1), (1,\n    1), (2, 2)]\n \u2014 bad sequence (sorted by second elements); if \n    p = [3, 2,\n    1]\n, then \n    s = [(3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 1)]\n \u2014 good sequence.\n\n",
