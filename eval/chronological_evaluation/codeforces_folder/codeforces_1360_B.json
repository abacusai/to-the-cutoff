        "description": "There are \n    n\n athletes in front of you. Athletes are numbered from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n from left to right. You know the strength of each athlete \u2014 the\nathlete number \n    i\n has the strength \n    s_i\n. You want to split all\nathletes into two teams. Each team must have at least one athlete, and each\nathlete must be exactly in one team. You want the strongest athlete from the\nfirst team to differ as little as possible from the weakest athlete from the\nsecond team. Formally, you want to split the athletes into two teams \n    A\n\nand \n    B\n so that the value \n    |\n    max(A) - \n    min(B)|\n is as small as\npossible, where \n    max(A)\n is the maximum strength of an athlete from\nteam \n    A\n, and \n    min(B)\n is the minimum strength of an athlete from\nteam \n    B\n. For example, if \n    n=5\n and the strength of the athletes is\n\n    s=[3, 1, 2, 6, 4]\n, then one of the possible split into teams is: first\nteam: \n    A = [1, 2, 4]\n, second team: \n    B = [3, 6]\n. In this case, the\nvalue \n    |\n    max(A) - \n    min(B)|\n will be equal to \n    |4-3|=1\n. This\nexample illustrates one of the ways of optimal split into two teams. Print the\nminimum value \n    |\n    max(A) - \n    min(B)|\n. Input The first line contains an\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the\ninput. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines.\nThe first line contains positive integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014\nnumber of athletes. The second line contains \n    n\n positive integers \n    s_1,\n    s_2, \n    \u2026, s_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 s_i \n    \u2264 1000\n), where \n    s_i\n \u2014 is the\nstrength of the \n    i\n-th athlete. Please note that \n    s\n values may not be\ndistinct. Output For each test case print one integer \u2014 the minimum value of\n\n    |\n    max(A) - \n    min(B)|\n with the optimal split of all athletes into two\nteams. Each of the athletes must be a member of exactly one of the two teams.\nExample Input 5 5 3 1 2 6 4 6 2 1 3 2 4 3 4 7 9 3 1 2 1 1000 3 100 150 200\nOutput 1 0 2 999 50 Note The first test case was explained in the statement.\nIn the second test case, one of the optimal splits is \n    A=[2, 1]\n, \n    B=[3,\n    2, 4, 3]\n, so the answer is \n    |2-2|=0\n.\n\n",
