        "name": "Electrical Efficiency",
        "description": "In the country of Dengkleknesia, there are \n    N\n factories numbered from\n\n    1\n to \n    N\n. Factory \n    i\n has an electrical coefficient of\n\n    A_i\n. There are also \n    N-1\n power lines with the \n    j\n-th power line\nconnecting factory \n    U_j\n and factory \n    V_j\n. It can be guaranteed that\neach factory in Dengkleknesia is connected to all other factories in\nDengkleknesia through one or more power lines. In other words, the collection\nof factories forms a tree. Each pair of different factories in Dengkleknesia\ncan use one or more existing power lines to transfer electricity to each\nother. However, each power line needs to be turned on first so that\nelectricity can pass through it. Define \n    f(x, y, z)\n as the minimum number\nof power lines that need to be turned on so that factory \n    x\n can make\nelectrical transfers to factory \n    y\n and factory \n    z\n. Also define\n\n    g(x, y, z)\n as the number of distinct prime factors of\n\n    GCD(A_x, A_y, A_z)\n. To measure the electrical efficiency, you\nmust find the sum of \n    f(x, y, z) \n    \u00d7 g(x, y, z)\n for all combinations\nof \n    (x, y, z)\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 x < y < z \n    \u2264 N\n. Because the\nanswer can be very large, you just need to output the answer modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Note: \n    GCD(k_1, k_2, k_3)\n is the\ngreatest common divisor of \n    k_1\n, \n    k_2\n, and \n    k_3\n, which is the\nbiggest integer that simultaneously divides \n    k_1\n, \n    k_2\n, and\n\n    k_3\n. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    N\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    N \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of factories in Dengkleknesia. The\nsecond line contains \n    N\n integers \n    A_1, A_2, \n    \u2026, A_N\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 A_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the electrical coefficients of the\nfactories. The \n    j\n-th of the next \n    N-1\n lines contains two integers\n\n    U_j\n and \n    V_j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 U_j, V_j \n    \u2264 N\n) \u2014 a power line that\nconnects cities \n    U_j\n and \n    V_j\n. The collection of factories forms a\ntree. Output An integer representing the sum of \n    f(x, y, z) \n    \u00d7 g(x, y,\n    z)\n for all combinations of \n    (x, y, z)\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 x < y < z\n    \n    \u2264 N\n, modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n Examples Input 3 1 2 3 1 2 2 3\nOutput 0 Input 4 6 14 6 6 1 2 2 3 2 4 Output 12 Note In the first example, the\nonly \n    (x, y, z)\n possible is \n    (1, 2, 3)\n. Because \n    GCD(A_1,\n    A_2, A_3) = \n    GCD(1, 2, 3) = 1\n has \n    0\n distinct prime factors,\ntherefore \n    f(x, y, z) \n    \u00d7 g(x, y, z) = 2 \n    \u00d7 0 = 0\n. In the\nsecond example, all triples \n    (x, y, z)\n that satisfy the condition are as\nfollows: \n    (1, 2, 3) \n    \u2192 f(1, 2, 3) \n    \u00d7 g(1, 2, 3) = 2\n    \n    \u00d7 1 = 2\n \n    (1, 2, 4) \n    \u2192 f(1, 2, 4) \n    \u00d7 g(1, 2, 4) =\n    2 \n    \u00d7 1 = 2\n \n    (1, 3, 4) \n    \u2192 f(1, 3, 4) \n    \u00d7 g(1, 3, 4)\n    = 3 \n    \u00d7 2 = 6\n \n    (2, 3, 4) \n    \u2192 f(2, 3, 4) \n    \u00d7 g(2, 3,\n    4) = 2 \n    \u00d7 1 = 2\n So the electrical efficiency is \n    2 + 2 + 6 + 2 =\n    12\n.\n\n",
