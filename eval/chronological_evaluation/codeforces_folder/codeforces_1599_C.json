        "description": "Little Johnny Bubbles enjoys spending hours in front of his computer playing\nvideo games. His favorite game is Bubble Strike, fast-paced bubble shooting\nonline game for two players. Each game is set in one of the N maps, each\nhaving different terrain configuration. First phase of each game decides on\nwhich map the game will be played. The game system randomly selects three maps\nand shows them to the players. Each player must pick one of those three maps\nto be discarded. The game system then randomly selects one of the maps that\nwere not picked by any of the players and starts the game. Johnny is deeply\nenthusiastic about the game and wants to spend some time studying maps, thus\nincreasing chances to win games played on those maps. However, he also needs\nto do his homework, so he does not have time to study all the maps. That is\nwhy he asked himself the following question: \"What is the minimum number of\nmaps I have to study, so that the probability to play one of those maps is at\nleast \n    P\n\"? Can you help Johnny find the answer for this question? You can\nassume Johnny's opponents do not know him, and they will randomly pick maps.\nInput The first line contains two integers \n    N\n (\n    3\n \n    \u2264\n\n\n    N\n \n    \u2264\n \n    10^3\n) and \n    P\n (\n    0\n \n    \u2264\n \n    P\n\n\n    \u2264\n \n    1\n) \u2013 total number of maps in the game and probability to\nplay map Johnny has studied. \n    P\n will have at most four digits after the\ndecimal point. Output Output contains one integer number \u2013 minimum number of\nmaps Johnny has to study. Example Input 7 1.0000 Output 6\n\n",
