        "description": "Bob is a competitive programmer. He wants to become red, and for that he needs\na strict training regime. He went to the annual meeting of grandmasters and\nasked \n    n\n of them how much effort they needed to reach red. \"Oh, I just\nspent \n    x_i\n hours solving problems\", said the \n    i\n-th of them. Bob\nwants to train his math skills, so for each answer he wrote down the number of\nminutes (\n    60 \n    \u00b7 x_i\n), thanked the grandmasters and went home. Bob\ncould write numbers with leading zeroes \u2014 for example, if some grandmaster\nanswered that he had spent \n    2\n hours, Bob could write \n    000120\n instead\nof \n    120\n. Alice wanted to tease Bob and so she took the numbers Bob wrote\ndown, and for each of them she did one of the following independently:\nrearranged its digits, or wrote a random number. This way, Alice generated\n\n    n\n numbers, denoted \n    y_1\n, ..., \n    y_n\n. For each of the numbers,\nhelp Bob determine whether \n    y_i\n can be a permutation of a number\ndivisible by \n    60\n (possibly with leading zeroes). Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 418\n) \u2014 the number\nof grandmasters Bob asked. Then \n    n\n lines follow, the \n    i\n-th of which\ncontains a single integer \n    y_i\n \u2014 the number that Alice wrote down. Each\nof these numbers has between \n    2\n and \n    100\n digits '0' through '9'.\nThey can contain leading zeroes. Output Output \n    n\n lines. For each\n\n    i\n, output the following. If it is possible to rearrange the digits of\n\n    y_i\n such that the resulting number is divisible by \n    60\n, output\n\"red\" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output \"cyan\". Example Input 6 603 006\n205 228 1053 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Output red red\ncyan cyan cyan red Note In the first example, there is one rearrangement that\nyields a number divisible by \n    60\n, and that is \n    360\n. In the second\nexample, there are two solutions. One is \n    060\n and the second is\n\n    600\n. In the third example, there are \n    6\n possible rearrangments:\n\n    025\n, \n    052\n, \n    205\n, \n    250\n, \n    502\n, \n    520\n. None of\nthese numbers is divisible by \n    60\n. In the fourth example, there are\n\n    3\n rearrangements: \n    228\n, \n    282\n, \n    822\n. In the fifth example,\nnone of the \n    24\n rearrangements result in a number divisible by \n    60\n.\nIn the sixth example, note that \n    000\n    \u20260\n is a valid solution.\n\n",
