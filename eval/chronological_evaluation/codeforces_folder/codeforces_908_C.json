        "description": "Carol is currently curling. She has n disks each with radius r on the 2D\nplane. Initially she has all these disks above the line y = 10^100. She then\nwill slide the disks towards the line y = 0 one by one in order from 1 to n.\nWhen she slides the i-th disk, she will place its center at the point (xi,\n10^100). She will then push it so the disk\u2019s y coordinate continuously\ndecreases, and x coordinate stays constant. The disk stops once it touches the\nline y = 0 or it touches any previous disk. Note that once a disk stops\nmoving, it will not move again, even if hit by another disk. Compute the\ny-coordinates of centers of all the disks after all disks have been pushed.\nInput The first line will contain two integers n and r (1 \u2264 n, r \u2264 1 000), the\nnumber of disks, and the radius of the disks, respectively. The next line will\ncontain n integers x1, x2, ..., xn (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the x-coordinates of the\ndisks. Output Print a single line with n numbers. The i-th number denotes the\ny-coordinate of the center of the i-th disk. The output will be accepted if it\nhas absolute or relative error at most 10^-6. Namely, let's assume that your\nanswer for a particular value of a coordinate is a and the answer of the jury\nis b. The checker program will consider your answer correct if for all\ncoordinates. Example Input 6 2 5 5 6 8 3 12 Output 2 6.0 9.87298334621\n13.3370849613 12.5187346573 13.3370849613 Note The final positions of the\ndisks will look as follows: In particular, note the position of the last disk.\n\n",
