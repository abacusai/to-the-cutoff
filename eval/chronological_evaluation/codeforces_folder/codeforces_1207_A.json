To\nassemble a chicken burger you need two buns and a chicken cutlet. You have\n\n    b\n buns, \n    p\n beef patties and \n    f\n chicken cutlets in your\nrestaurant. You can sell one hamburger for \n    h\n dollars and one chicken\nburger for \n    c\n dollars. Calculate the maximum profit you can achieve. You\nhave to answer \n    t\n independent queries. Input The first line contains one\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2013 the number of queries. The first\nline of each query contains three integers \n    b\n, \n    p\n and \n    f\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 b, \u00a0p, \u00a0f \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of buns, beef patties and chicken\ncutlets in your restaurant. The second line of each query contains two\nintegers \n    h\n and \n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 h, \u00a0c \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the hamburger\nand chicken burger prices in your restaurant. Output For each query print one\ninteger \u2014 the maximum profit you can achieve. Example Input 3 15 2 3 5 10 7 5\n2 10 12 1 100 100 100 100 Output 40 34 0 Note In first query you have to sell\ntwo hamburgers and three chicken burgers. Your income is \n    2 \n    \u00b7 5 + 3\n    \n    \u00b7 10 = 40\n. In second query you have to ell one hamburgers and two\nchicken burgers. Your income is \n    1 \n    \u00b7 10 + 2 \n    \u00b7 12 = 34\n. In\nthird query you can not create any type of burgers because because you have\nonly one bun. So your income is zero.\n\n",
