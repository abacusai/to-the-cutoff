        "description": "Your task is the exact same as for the easy version. But this time, the\nmarmots subtract the village's population P from their random number before\nresponding to Heidi's request. Also, there are now villages with as few as a\nsingle inhabitant, meaning that . Can you help Heidi find out whether a\nvillage follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution? Input Same as for the\neasy and medium versions. But remember that now 1 \u2264 P \u2264 1000 and that the\nmarmots may provide positive as well as negative integers. Output Output one\nline per village, in the same order as provided in the input. The village's\nline shall state poisson if the village's distribution is of the Poisson type,\nand uniform if the answers came from a uniform distribution.\n\n",
