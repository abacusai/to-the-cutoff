        "description": "Two boys decided to compete in text typing on the site \"Key races\". During the\ncompetition, they have to type a text consisting of s characters. The first\nparticipant types one character in v1 milliseconds and has ping t1\nmilliseconds. The second participant types one character in v2 milliseconds\nand has ping t2 milliseconds. If connection ping (delay) is t milliseconds,\nthe competition passes for a participant as follows: Exactly after t\nmilliseconds after the start of the competition the participant receives the\ntext to be entered. Right after that he starts to type it. Exactly t\nmilliseconds after he ends typing all the text, the site receives information\nabout it. The winner is the participant whose information on the success comes\nearlier. If the information comes from both participants at the same time, it\nis considered that there is a draw. Given the length of the text and the\ninformation about participants, determine the result of the game. Input The\nfirst line contains five integers s, v1, v2, t1, t2 (1 \u2264 s, v1, v2, t1, t2 \u2264\n1000) \u2014 the number of characters in the text, the time of typing one character\nfor the first participant, the time of typing one character for the the second\nparticipant, the ping of the first participant and the ping of the second\nparticipant. Output If the first participant wins, print \"First\". If the\nsecond participant wins, print \"Second\". In case of a draw print \"Friendship\".\nExamples Input 5 1 2 1 2 Output First Input 3 3 1 1 1 Output Second Input 4 5\n3 1 5 Output Friendship Note In the first example, information on the success\nof the first participant comes in 7 milliseconds, of the second participant \u2014\nin 14 milliseconds. So, the first wins. In the second example, information on\nthe success of the first participant comes in 11 milliseconds, of the second\nparticipant \u2014 in 5 milliseconds. So, the second wins. In the third example,\ninformation on the success of the first participant comes in 22 milliseconds,\nof the second participant \u2014 in 22 milliseconds. So, it is be a draw.\n\n",
