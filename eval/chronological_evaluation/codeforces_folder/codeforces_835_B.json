        "description": "Some natural number was written on the board. Its sum of digits was not less\nthan k. But you were distracted a bit, and someone changed this number to n,\nreplacing some digits with others. It's known that the length of the number\ndidn't change. You have to find the minimum number of digits in which these\ntwo numbers can differ. Input The first line contains integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264\n10^9). The second line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n < 10^100000). There are no\nleading zeros in n. It's guaranteed that this situation is possible. Output\nPrint the minimum number of digits in which the initial number and n can\ndiffer. Examples Input 3 11 Output 1 Input 3 99 Output 0 Note In the first\nexample, the initial number could be 12. In the second example the sum of the\ndigits of n is not less than k. The initial number could be equal to n.\n\n",
