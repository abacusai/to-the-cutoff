        "description": "Lee is used to finish his stories in a stylish way, this time he barely failed\nit, but Ice Bear came and helped him. Lee is so grateful for it, so he decided\nto show Ice Bear his new game called \"Critic\"... The game is a one versus one\ngame. It has \n    t\n rounds, each round has two integers \n    s_i\n and\n\n    e_i\n (which are determined and are known before the game begins,\n\n    s_i\n and \n    e_i\n may differ from round to round). The integer \n    s_i\n\nis written on the board at the beginning of the corresponding round. The\nplayers will take turns. Each player will erase the number on the board (let's\nsay it was \n    a\n) and will choose to write either \n    2 \n    \u00b7 a\n or \n    a\n    + 1\n instead. Whoever writes a number strictly greater than \n    e_i\n loses\nthat round and the other one wins that round. Now Lee wants to play \"Critic\"\nagainst Ice Bear, for each round he has chosen the round's \n    s_i\n and\n\n    e_i\n in advance. Lee will start the first round, the loser of each round\nwill start the next round. The winner of the last round is the winner of the\ngame, and the loser of the last round is the loser of the game. Determine if\nLee can be the winner independent of Ice Bear's moves or not. Also, determine\nif Lee can be the loser independent of Ice Bear's moves or not. Input The\nfirst line contains the integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of rounds the game has. Then \n    t\n lines follow, each contains two\nintegers \n    s_i\n and \n    e_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 s_i \n    \u2264 e_i \n    \u2264 10^18\n) \u2014\nthe \n    i\n-th round's information. The rounds are played in the same order as\ngiven in input, \n    s_i\n and \n    e_i\n for all rounds are known to everyone\nbefore the game starts. Output Print two integers. The first one should be 1\nif Lee can be the winner independent of Ice Bear's moves, and 0 otherwise. The\nsecond one should be 1 if Lee can be the loser independent of Ice Bear's\nmoves, and 0 otherwise.
