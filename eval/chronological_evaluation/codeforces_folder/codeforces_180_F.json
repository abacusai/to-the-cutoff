        "description": "Students of group 199 have written their lectures dismally. Now an exam on\nMathematical Analysis is approaching and something has to be done asap (that\nis, quickly). Let's number the students of the group from 1 to n. Each student\ni (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) has a best friend p[i] (1 \u2264 p[i] \u2264 n). In fact, each student is\na best friend of exactly one student. In other words, all p[i] are different.\nIt is possible that the group also has some really \"special individuals\" for\nwho i = p[i]. Each student wrote exactly one notebook of lecture notes. We\nknow that the students agreed to act by the following algorithm: on the first\nday of revising each student studies his own Mathematical Analysis notes, in\nthe morning of each following day each student gives the notebook to his best\nfriend and takes a notebook from the student who calls him the best friend.\nThus, on the second day the student p[i] (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) studies the i-th\nstudent's notes, on the third day the notes go to student p[p[i]] and so on.\nDue to some characteristics of the boys' friendship (see paragraph 1), each\nday each student has exactly one notebook to study. You are given two\nsequences that describe the situation on the third and fourth days of\nrevising: a1, a2, ..., an, where ai means the student who gets the i-th\nstudent's notebook on the third day of revising; b1, b2, ..., bn, where bi\nmeans the student who gets the i-th student's notebook on the fourth day of\nrevising. You do not know array p, that is you do not know who is the best\nfriend to who. Write a program that finds p by the given sequences a and b.\nInput The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of\nstudents in the group. The second line contains sequence of different integers\na1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 n). The third line contains the sequence of\ndifferent integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 \u2264 bi \u2264 n). Output Print sequence n of\ndifferent integers p[1], p[2], ..., p[n] (1 \u2264 p[i] \u2264 n). It is guaranteed that\nthe solution exists and that it is unique. Examples Input 4 2 1 4 3 3 4 2 1\nOutput 4 3 1 2 Input 5 5 2 3 1 4 1 3 2 4 5 Output 4 3 2 5 1 Input 2 1 2 2 1\nOutput 2 1\n\n",
