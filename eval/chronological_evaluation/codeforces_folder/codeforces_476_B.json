        "description": "Dreamoon is standing at the position 0 on a number line. Drazil is sending a\nlist of commands through Wi-Fi to Dreamoon's smartphone and Dreamoon follows\nthem. Each command is one of the following two types: Go 1 unit towards the\npositive direction, denoted as '+' Go 1 unit towards the negative direction,\ndenoted as '-' But the Wi-Fi condition is so poor that Dreamoon's smartphone\nreports some of the commands can't be recognized and Dreamoon knows that some\nof them might even be wrong though successfully recognized. Dreamoon decides\nto follow every recognized command and toss a fair coin to decide those\nunrecognized ones (that means, he moves to the 1 unit to the negative or\npositive direction with the same probability 0.5). You are given an original\nlist of commands sent by Drazil and list received by Dreamoon. What is the\nprobability that Dreamoon ends in the position originally supposed to be final\nby Drazil's commands? Input The first line contains a string s1 \u2014 the commands\nDrazil sends to Dreamoon, this string consists of only the characters in the\nset '+', '-'. The second line contains a string s2 \u2014 the commands Dreamoon's\nsmartphone recognizes, this string consists of only the characters in the set\n'+', '-', '?'. '?' denotes an unrecognized command. Lengths of two strings\nare equal and do not exceed 10. Output Output a single real number\ncorresponding to the probability. The answer will be considered correct if its\nrelative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10^-9. Examples Input ++-+- +-+-+\nOutput 1.000000000000 Input +-+- +-?? Output 0.500000000000 Input +++ ??-\nOutput 0.000000000000 Note For the first sample, both s1 and s2 will lead\nDreamoon to finish at the same position + 1. For the second sample, s1 will\nlead Dreamoon to finish at position 0, while there are four possibilites for\ns2: \"+-++\", \"+-+-\", \"+\u2013+\", \"+\u2014\" with ending position +2, 0, 0, -2\nrespectively. So there are 2 correct cases out of 4, so the probability of\nfinishing at the correct position is 0.5. For the third sample, s2 could only\nlead us to finish at positions +1, -1, -3, so the probability to finish at\nthe correct position + 3 is 0.\n\n",
