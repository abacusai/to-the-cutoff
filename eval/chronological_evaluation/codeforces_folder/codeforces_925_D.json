        "description": "Indiana Jones found ancient Aztec catacombs containing a golden idol. The\ncatacombs consists of \n    n\n caves. Each pair of caves is connected with a\ntwo-way corridor that can be opened or closed. The entrance to the catacombs\nis in the cave \n    1\n, the idol and the exit are in the cave \n    n\n. When\nIndiana goes from a cave \n    x\n to a cave \n    y\n using an open corridor, all\ncorridors connected to the cave \n    x\n change their state: all open corridors\nbecome closed, all closed corridors become open. Indiana wants to go from cave\n\n    1\n to cave \n    n\n going through as small number of corridors as\npossible. Help him find the optimal path, or determine that it is impossible\nto get out of catacombs. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n\nand \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3\n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 3\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of caves and the number of open corridors at the\ninitial moment. The next \n    m\n lines describe the open corridors. The\n\n    i\n-th of these lines contains two integers \n    u_i\n and \n    v_i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    u_i \n    \u2260 v_i\n) \u2014 the caves connected by\nthe \n    i\n-th open corridor. It is guaranteed that each unordered pair of\ncaves is presented at most once. Output If there is a path to exit, in the\nfirst line print a single integer \n    k\n \u2014 the minimum number of corridors\nIndians should pass through (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^6\n). In the second line\nprint \n    k+1\n integers \n    x_0, \n    \u2026, x_k\n \u2014 the number of caves in the\norder Indiana should visit them. The sequence \n    x_0, \n    \u2026, x_k\n should\nsatisfy the following: \n    x_0 = 1\n, \n    x_k = n\n; for each \n    i\n from\n\n    1\n to \n    k\n the corridor from \n    x_i - 1\n to \n    x_i\n should be\nopen at the moment Indiana walks along this corridor.If there is no path,\nprint a single integer \n    -1\n. We can show that if there is a path, there is\na path consisting of no more than \n    10^6\n corridors. Examples Input 4 4 1 2\n2 3 1 3 3 4 Output 2 1 3 4 Input 4 2 1 2 2 3 Output 4 1 2 3 1 4\n\n",
