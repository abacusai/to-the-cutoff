        "description": "Bob is an active user of the social network Faithbug. On this network, people\nare able to engage in a mutual friendship. That is, if \n    a\n is a friend of\n\n    b\n, then \n    b\n is also a friend of \n    a\n. Each user thus has a non-\nnegative amount of friends. This morning, somebody anonymously sent Bob the\nfollowing link: graph realization problem and Bob wants to know who that was.\nIn order to do that, he first needs to know how the social network looks like.\nHe investigated the profile of every other person on the network and noted\ndown the number of his friends. However, he neglected to note down the number\nof his friends. Help him find out how many friends he has. Since there may be\nmany possible answers, print all of them. Input The first line contains one\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n), the number of people\non the network excluding Bob. The second line contains \n    n\n numbers\n\n    a_1,a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n), with \n    a_i\n\nbeing the number of people that person \n    i\n is a friend of. Output Print\nall possible values of \n    a_n+1\n \u2014 the amount of people that Bob can be\nfriend of, in increasing order. If no solution exists, output \n    -1\n.\nExamples Input 3 3 3 3 Output 3 Input 4 1 1 1 1 Output 0 2 4 Input 2 0 2\nOutput -1 Input 35 21 26 18 4 28 2 15 13 16 25 6 32 11 5 31 17 9 3 24 33 14 27\n29 1 20 4 12 7 10 30 34 8 19 23 22 Output 13 15 17 19 21 Note In the first\ntest case, the only solution is that everyone is friends with everyone. That\nis why Bob should have \n    3\n friends. In the second test case, there are\nthree possible solutions (apart from symmetries): \n    a\n is friend of\n\n    b\n, \n    c\n is friend of \n    d\n, and Bob has no friends, or \n    a\n is a\nfriend of \n    b\n and both \n    c\n and \n    d\n are friends with Bob, or Bob is\nfriends of everyone. The third case is impossible to solve, as the second\nperson needs to be a friend with everybody, but the first one is a complete\nstranger.\n\n",
