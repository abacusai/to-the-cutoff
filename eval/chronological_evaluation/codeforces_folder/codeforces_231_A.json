        "description": "One day three best friends Petya, Vasya and Tonya decided to form a team and\ntake part in programming contests. Participants are usually offered several\nproblems during programming contests. Long before the start the friends\ndecided that they will implement a problem if at least two of them are sure\nabout the solution. Otherwise, the friends won't write the problem's solution.\nThis contest offers n problems to the participants. For each problem we know,\nwhich friend is sure about the solution. Help the friends find the number of\nproblems for which they will write a solution. Input The first input line\ncontains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of problems in the\ncontest. Then n lines contain three integers each, each integer is either 0 or\n1. If the first number in the line equals 1, then Petya is sure about the\nproblem's solution, otherwise he isn't sure. The second number shows Vasya's\nview on the solution, the third number shows Tonya's view. The numbers on the\nlines are separated by spaces. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of\nproblems the friends will implement on the contest. Examples Input 3 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 Output 2 Input 2 1 0 0 0 1 1 Output 1 Note In the first sample Petya\nand Vasya are sure that they know how to solve the first problem and all three\nof them know how to solve the second problem. That means that they will write\nsolutions for these problems. Only Petya is sure about the solution for the\nthird problem, but that isn't enough, so the friends won't take it. In the\nsecond sample the friends will only implement the second problem, as Vasya and\nTonya are sure about the solution.\n\n",
