        "description": "Let \n    a\n be a matrix of size \n    r \n    \u00d7 c\n containing positive\nintegers, not necessarily distinct. Rows of the matrix are numbered from\n\n    1\n to \n    r\n, columns are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    c\n. We can\nconstruct an array \n    b\n consisting of \n    r + c\n integers as follows: for\neach \n    i \n    \u2208 [1, r]\n, let \n    b_i\n be the greatest common divisor of\nintegers in the \n    i\n-th row, and for each \n    j \n    \u2208 [1, c]\n let\n\n    b_r+j\n be the greatest common divisor of integers in the \n    j\n-th\ncolumn. We call the matrix diverse if all \n    r + c\n numbers \n    b_k\n (\n    k\n    \n    \u2208 [1, r + c]\n) are pairwise distinct. The magnitude of a matrix equals\nto the maximum of \n    b_k\n. For example, suppose we have the following\nmatrix: \n    [   2   9   7; ; ;   4 144  84;  ]\n\nWe construct the array \n    b\n: \n    b_1\n is the greatest common divisor of\n\n    2\n, \n    9\n, and \n    7\n, that is \n    1\n; \n    b_2\n is the greatest\ncommon divisor of \n    4\n, \n    144\n, and \n    84\n, that is \n    4\n; \n    b_3\n\nis the greatest common divisor of \n    2\n and \n    4\n, that is \n    2\n;\n\n    b_4\n is the greatest common divisor of \n    9\n and \n    144\n, that is\n\n    9\n; \n    b_5\n is the greatest common divisor of \n    7\n and \n    84\n,\nthat is \n    7\n. So \n    b = [1, 4, 2, 9, 7]\n. All values in this array are\ndistinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to \n    9\n. For a\ngiven \n    r\n and \n    c\n, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude.\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. If there are no\nsolutions, output a single integer \n    0\n. Input The only line in the input\ncontains two space separated integers \n    r\n and \n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 r,c\n    \n    \u2264 500\n) \u2014 the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix to\nbe found. Output If there is no solution, output a single integer \n    0\n.\nOtherwise, output \n    r\n rows. The \n    i\n-th of them should contain \n    c\n\nspace-separated integers, the \n    j\n-th of which is \n    a_i,j\n \u2014 the\npositive integer in the \n    i\n-th row and \n    j\n-th column of a diverse\nmatrix minimizing the magnitude. Furthermore, it must hold that \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    a_i,j\n    \u2264 10^9\n. It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is\nalso a solution with this additional constraint (still having minimum possible\nmagnitude). Examples Input 2 2 Output 4 12 2 9 Input 1 1 Output 0 Note In the\nfirst example, the GCDs of rows are \n    b_1 = 4\n and \n    b_2 = 1\n, and the\nGCDs of columns are \n    b_3 = 2\n and \n    b_4 = 3\n. All GCDs are pairwise\ndistinct and the maximum of them is \n    4\n. Since the GCDs have to be\ndistinct and at least \n    1\n, it is clear that there are no diverse matrices\nof size \n    2 \n    \u00d7 2\n with magnitude smaller than \n    4\n. In the second\nexample, no matter what \n    a_1,1\n is, \n    b_1 = b_2\n will always hold, so\nthere are no diverse matrices.\n\n",
