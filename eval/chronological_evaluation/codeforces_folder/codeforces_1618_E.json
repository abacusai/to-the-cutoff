        "description": "\n    n\n towns are arranged in a circle sequentially. The towns are numbered\nfrom \n    1\n to \n    n\n in clockwise order. In the \n    i\n-th town, there\nlives a singer with a repertoire of \n    a_i\n minutes for each \n    i \n    \u2208 [1,\n    n]\n. Each singer visited all \n    n\n towns in clockwise order, starting with\nthe town he lives in, and gave exactly one concert in each town. In addition,\nin each town, the \n    i\n-th singer got inspired and came up with a song that\nlasts \n    a_i\n minutes. The song was added to his repertoire so that he could\nperform it in the rest of the cities. Hence, for the \n    i\n-th singer, the\nconcert in the \n    i\n-th town will last \n    a_i\n minutes, in the \n    (i +\n    1)\n-th town the concert will last \n    2 \n    \u00b7 a_i\n minutes, ..., in the\n\n    ((i + k) \n     n + 1)\n-th town the duration of the concert will be\n\n    (k + 2) \n    \u00b7 a_i\n, ..., in the town \n    ((i + n - 2) \n     n + 1)\n\n\u2014 \n    n \n    \u00b7 a_i\n minutes. You are given an array of \n    b\n integer\nnumbers, where \n    b_i\n is the total duration of concerts in the \n    i\n-th\ntown. Reconstruct any correct sequence of positive integers \n    a\n or say\nthat it is impossible. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n \n    (1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 4 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of cities. The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the total duration of concerts in \n    i\n-th city. The\nsum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n.\nOutput For each test case, print the answer as follows: If there is no\nsuitable sequence \n    a\n, print NO. Otherwise, on the first line print YES,\non the next line print the sequence \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n of \n    n\n\nintegers, where \n    a_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) is the initial\nduration of repertoire of the \n    i\n-th singer. If there are multiple\nanswers, print any of them. Example Input 4 3 12 16 14 1 1 3 1 2 3 6 81 75 75\n93 93 87 Output YES 3 1 3 YES 1 NO YES 5 5 4 1 4 5 Note Let's consider the\n\n    1\n-st test case of the example: the \n    1\n-st singer in the \n    1\n-st\ncity will give a concert for \n    3\n minutes, in the \n    2\n-nd \u2014 for \n    6\n\nminutes, in the \n    3\n-rd \u2014 for \n    9\n minutes; the \n    2\n-nd singer in the\n\n    1\n-st city will give a concert for \n    3\n minutes, in the \n    2\n-nd \u2014\nfor \n    1\n minute, in the \n    3\n-rd - for \n    2\n minutes; the \n    3\n-rd\nsinger in the \n    1\n-st city will give a concert for \n    6\n minutes, in the\n\n    2\n-nd \u2014 for \n    9\n minutes, in the \n    3\n-rd \u2014 for \n    3\n minutes.\n\n",
