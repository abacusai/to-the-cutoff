        "description": "Because to take away a man's freedom of choice, even his freedom to make the\nwrong choice, is to manipulate him as though he were a puppet and not a\nperson. \u2014 Madeleine L'Engle There are \n    n\n programmers choosing their\nfavorite algorithm amongst \n    m\n different choice options. Before the first\nround, all \n    m\n options are available. In each round, every programmer\nmakes a vote for one of the remaining algorithms. After the round, only the\nalgorithms with the maximum number of votes remain. The voting process ends\nwhen there is only one option left. Determine whether the voting process can\ncontinue indefinitely or no matter how people vote, they will eventually\nchoose a single option after some finite amount of rounds? Input The first\nline contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number of\npeople and choice options respectively. Output For each test case output \"YES\"\nif the programmers will eventually choose a single option, and \"NO\" otherwise.\nYou may print each letter in any case (for example, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will\nall be recognized as a positive answer). Example Input 5 3 2 4 2 5 3 1000000\n1000000 1 1000000 Output YES NO YES NO YES Note In the first example, there\nare \n    8\n ways people could vote: \n    1|1|1, 1|1|2, 1|2|1, 1|2|2, 2|1|1,\n    2|1|2, 2|2|1, 2|2|2\n. In cases \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    3\n, and \n    5\n,\nthe programmers are left with the first algorithm, and in the remaining cases\npeople are left with the second one, so the voting ends in one round in any\ncase. In the second example, the programmers could always vote \n    1|1|2|2\n.\nBoth algorithms have the maximum number of votes and remain for the next\nround, so the voting never ends.\n\n",
