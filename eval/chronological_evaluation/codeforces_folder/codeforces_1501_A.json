        "name": "Alexey and Train",
        "description": "Alexey is travelling on a train. Unfortunately, due to the bad weather, the\ntrain moves slower that it should! Alexey took the train at the railroad\nterminal. Let's say that the train starts from the terminal at the moment\n\n    0\n. Also, let's say that the train will visit \n    n\n stations numbered\nfrom \n    1\n to \n    n\n along its way, and that Alexey destination is the\nstation \n    n\n. Alexey learned from the train schedule \n    n\n integer pairs\n\n    (a_i, b_i)\n where \n    a_i\n is the expected time of train's arrival at\nthe \n    i\n-th station and \n    b_i\n is the expected time of departure. Also,\nusing all information he has, Alexey was able to calculate \n    n\n integers\n\n    tm_1, tm_2, \n    \u2026, tm_n\n where \n    tm_i\n is the extra time the train\nneed to travel from the station \n    i - 1\n to the station \n    i\n. Formally,\nthe train needs exactly \n    a_i - b_i-1 + tm_i\n time to travel from station\n\n    i - 1\n to station \n    i\n (if \n    i = 1\n then \n    b_0\n is the moment\nthe train leave the terminal, and it's equal to \n    0\n). The train leaves the\nstation \n    i\n, if both conditions are met: it's on the station for at least\n\n    \u2308\n    b_i - a_i/2\n    \n    \u2309\n units of time\n(division with ceiling); current time \n    \u2265 b_i\n. Since Alexey spent all\nhis energy on prediction of time delays, help him to calculate the time of\narrival at the station \n    n\n. Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line\nof each test case contains the single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    100\n) \u2014 the number of stations. Next \n    n\n lines contain two integers\neach: \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i < b_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n). It's\nguaranteed that \n    b_i < a_i+1\n. Next line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    tm_1, tm_2, \n    \u2026, tm_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 tm_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n). Output For\neach test case, print one integer \u2014 the time of Alexey's arrival at the last\nstation. Example Input 2 2 2 4 10 12 0 2 5 1 4 7 8 9 10 13 15 19 20 1 2 3 4 5\nOutput 12 32 Note In the first test case, Alexey arrives at station \n    1\n\nwithout any delay at the moment \n    a_1 = 2\n (since \n    tm_1 = 0\n). After\nthat, he departs at moment \n    b_1 = 4\n. Finally, he arrives at station\n\n    2\n with \n    tm_2 = 2\n extra time, or at the moment \n    12\n. In the\nsecond test case, Alexey arrives at the first station with \n    tm_1 = 1\n\nextra time, or at moment \n    2\n. The train, from one side, should stay at the\nstation at least \n    \u2308\n    b_1 - a_1/2\n    \n    \u2309 =\n    2\n units of time and from the other side should depart not earlier than at\nmoment \n    b_1 = 4\n. As a result, the trains departs right at the moment\n\n    4\n. Using the same logic, we can figure out that the train arrives at the\nsecond station at the moment \n    9\n and departs at the moment \n    10\n; at\nthe third station: arrives at \n    14\n and departs at \n    15\n; at the fourth:\narrives at \n    22\n and departs at \n    23\n. And, finally, arrives at the\nfifth station at \n    32\n.\n\n",
