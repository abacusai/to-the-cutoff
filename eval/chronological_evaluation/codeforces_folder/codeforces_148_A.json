She had\ntrouble falling asleep, and she got bored of counting lambs when she was nine.\nHowever, just counting dragons was boring as well, so she entertained herself\nat best she could. Tonight she imagined that all dragons were here to steal\nher, and she was fighting them off. Every k-th dragon got punched in the face\nwith a frying pan. Every l-th dragon got his tail shut into the balcony door.\nEvery m-th dragon got his paws trampled with sharp heels. Finally, she\nthreatened every n-th dragon to call her mom, and he withdrew in panic. How\nmany imaginary dragons suffered moral or physical damage tonight, if the\nprincess counted a total of d dragons? Input Input data contains integer\nnumbers k, l, m, n and d, each number in a separate line (1 \u2264 k, l, m, n \u2264 10,\n1 \u2264 d \u2264 10^5). Output Output the number of damaged dragons. Examples Input 1 2\n3 4 12 Output 12 Input 2 3 4 5 24 Output 17 Note In the first case every first\ndragon got punched with a frying pan. Some of the dragons suffered from other\nreasons as well, but the pan alone would be enough. In the second case dragons\n1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 and 23 escaped unharmed.\n\n",
