        "description": "You invited \n    n\n guests to dinner! You plan to arrange one or more circles\nof chairs. Each chair is going to be either occupied by one guest, or be\nempty. You can make any number of circles. Your guests happen to be a little\nbit shy, so the \n    i\n-th guest wants to have a least \n    l_i\n free chairs\nto the left of his chair, and at least \n    r_i\n free chairs to the right. The\n\"left\" and \"right\" directions are chosen assuming all guests are going to be\nseated towards the center of the circle. Note that when a guest is the only\none in his circle, the \n    l_i\n chairs to his left and \n    r_i\n chairs to\nhis right may overlap. What is smallest total number of chairs you have to\nuse? Input First line contains one integer \n    n\n \u2014 number of guests, (\n    1\n    \n    \u2a7d n \n    \u2a7d 10^5\n). Next \n    n\n lines contain \n    n\n pairs\nof space-separated integers \n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2a7d l_i, r_i\n    \n    \u2a7d 10^9\n). Output Output a single integer \u2014 the smallest number of\nchairs you have to use. Examples Input 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 6 Input 4 1 2 2 1\n3 5 5 3 Output 15 Input 1 5 6 Output 7 Note In the second sample the only\noptimal answer is to use two circles: a circle with \n    5\n chairs\naccomodating guests \n    1\n and \n    2\n, and another one with \n    10\n chairs\naccomodationg guests \n    3\n and \n    4\n. In the third sample, you have only\none circle with one person. The guest should have at least five free chairs to\nhis left, and at least six free chairs to his right to the next person, which\nis in this case the guest herself. So, overall number of chairs should be at\nleast 6+1=7.\n\n",
