        "description": "Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive\nintegers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7.\nFor example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not. One day\nPetya was delivered a string s, containing only digits. He needs to find a\nstring that represents a lucky number without leading zeroes, is not empty, is\ncontained in s as a substring the maximum number of times.Among all the\nstrings for which the three conditions given above are fulfilled, Petya only\nneeds the lexicographically minimum one. Find this string for Petya. Input The\nsingle line contains a non-empty string s whose length can range from 1 to 50,\ninclusive. The string only contains digits. The string can contain leading\nzeroes. Output In the only line print the answer to Petya's problem. If the\nsought string does not exist, print \"-1\" (without quotes). Examples Input 047\nOutput 4 Input 16 Output -1 Input 472747 Output 7 Note The lexicographical\ncomparison of strings is performed by the < operator in the modern programming\nlanguages. String x is lexicographically less than string y either if x is a\nprefix of y, or exists such i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 min(|x|, |y|)), that xi < yi and for\nany j (1 \u2264 j < i) xj = yj. Here |a| denotes the length of string a. In the\nfirst sample three conditions are fulfilled for strings \"4\", \"7\" and \"47\". The\nlexicographically minimum one is \"4\". In the second sample s has no substrings\nwhich are lucky numbers. In the third sample the three conditions are only\nfulfilled for string \"7\".\n\n",
