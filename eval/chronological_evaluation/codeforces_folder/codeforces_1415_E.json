        "description": "Wabbit is playing a game with \n    n\n bosses numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n.\nThe bosses can be fought in any order. Each boss needs to be defeated exactly\nonce. There is a parameter called boss bonus which is initially \n    0\n. When\nthe \n    i\n-th boss is defeated, the current boss bonus is added to Wabbit's\nscore, and then the value of the boss bonus increases by the point increment\n\n    c_i\n. Note that \n    c_i\n can be negative, which means that other bosses\nnow give fewer points. However, Wabbit has found a glitch in the game. At any\npoint in time, he can reset the playthrough and start a New Game Plus\nplaythrough. This will set the current boss bonus to \n    0\n, while all\ndefeated bosses remain defeated. The current score is also saved and does not\nreset to zero after this operation. This glitch can be used at most \n    k\n\ntimes. He can reset after defeating any number of bosses (including before or\nafter defeating all of them), and he also can reset the game several times in\na row without defeating any boss. Help Wabbit determine the maximum score he\ncan obtain if he has to defeat all \n    n\n bosses. Input The first line of\ninput contains two spaced integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n), representing the\nnumber of bosses and the number of resets allowed. The next line of input\ncontains \n    n\n spaced integers \n    c_1,c_2,\n    \u2026,c_n\n (\n    -10^6 \n    \u2264\n    c_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n), the point increments of the \n    n\n bosses. Output Output\na single integer, the maximum score Wabbit can obtain by defeating all \n    n\n\nbosses (this value may be negative). Examples Input 3 0 1 1 1 Output 3 Input 5\n1 -1 -2 -3 -4 5 Output 11 Input 13 2 3 1 4 1 5 -9 -2 -6 -5 -3 -5 -8 -9 Output\n71 Note In the first test case, no resets are allowed. An optimal sequence of\nfights would be Fight the first boss \n    (+0)\n. Boss bonus becomes equal to\n\n    1\n. Fight the second boss \n    (+1)\n. Boss bonus becomes equal to\n\n    2\n. Fight the third boss \n    (+2)\n. Boss bonus becomes equal to \n    3\n.\nThus the answer for the first test case is \n    0+1+2=3\n. In the second test\ncase, it can be shown that one possible optimal sequence of fights is Fight\nthe fifth boss \n    (+0)\n. Boss bonus becomes equal to \n    5\n. Fight the\nfirst boss \n    (+5)\n. Boss bonus becomes equal to \n    4\n. Fight the second\nboss \n    (+4)\n. Boss bonus becomes equal to \n    2\n. Fight the third boss\n\n    (+2)\n. Boss bonus becomes equal to \n    -1\n. Reset. Boss bonus becomes\nequal to \n    0\n. Fight the fourth boss \n    (+0)\n. Boss bonus becomes equal\nto \n    -4\n. Hence the answer for the second test case is \n    0+5+4+2+0=11\n.\n\n",
