        "description": "The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. Now\nelections are held in Berland and you want to win them. More precisely, you\nwant everyone to vote for you. There are \n    n\n voters, and two ways to\nconvince each of them to vote for you. The first way to convince the\n\n    i\n-th voter is to pay him \n    p_i\n coins. The second way is to make\n\n    m_i\n other voters vote for you, and the \n    i\n-th voter will vote for\nfree. Moreover, the process of such voting takes place in several steps. For\nexample, if there are five voters with \n    m_1 = 1\n, \n    m_2 = 2\n, \n    m_3 =\n    2\n, \n    m_4 = 4\n, \n    m_5 = 5\n, then you can buy the vote of the fifth\nvoter, and eventually everyone will vote for you. Set of people voting for you\nwill change as follows: \n    5\n    \u21921, 5\n    \u21921, 2, 3, 5\n    \u21921, 2, 3, 4, 5\n. Calculate the minimum number of coins you\nhave to spend so that everyone votes for you. Input The first line contains\none integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the number of voters. The next \n    n\n lines contains the\ndescription of voters. \n    i\n-th line contains two integers \n    m_i\n and\n\n    p_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 10^9, 0 \n    \u2264 m_i < n\n). It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of all \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    5000\n.\nOutput For each test case print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of coins you\nhave to spend so that everyone votes for you. Example Input 3 3 1 5 2 10 2 8 7\n0 1 3 1 1 1 6 1 1 1 4 1 4 1 6 2 6 2 3 2 8 2 7 4 4 5 5 Output 8 0 7 Note In the\nfirst test case you have to buy vote of the third voter. Then the set of\npeople voting for you will change as follows: \n    3\n    \u21921, 3\n    \u21921, 2, 3\n. In the second example you don't need to buy votes.\nThe set of people voting for you will change as follows: \n    1\n    \u21921, 3, 5\n    \u21921, 2, 3, 5\n    \u21921, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7\n    \u21921, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n. In the third test case you have to buy\nvotes of the second and the fifth voters. Then the set of people voting for\nyou will change as follows: \n    2, 5\n    \u21921, 2, 3, 4, 5\n    \u21921, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n.\n\n",
