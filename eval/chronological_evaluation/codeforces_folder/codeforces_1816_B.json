        "description": "Consider a \n    2 \n    \u00d7 n\n grid, where \n    n\n is an even integer. You may\nplace the integers \n    1, 2, \n    \u2026, 2n\n on the grid, using each integer\nexactly once. A path is a sequence of cells achieved by starting at \n    (1,\n    1)\n, then repeatedly walking either downwards or to the right, and stopping\nwhen \n    (2, n)\n is reached. The path should not extend beyond the grid. The\ncost of a path is the alternating sum of the numbers written on the cells in a\npath. That is, let the numbers written on the cells be \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_k\n (in the order that it is visited), the cost of the path is \n    a_1 - a_2\n    + a_3 - a_4 + \n    \u2026 = \n    \u2211_i=1^k a_i \n    \u00b7 (-1)^i+1\n. Construct a\nway to place the integers \n    1, 2, \n    \u2026, 2n\n on the grid, such that the\nminimum cost over all paths from \n    (1, 1)\n to \n    (2, n)\n is maximized. If\nthere are multiple such grids that result in the maximum value, output any of\nthem. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases\nfollows. The first and the only line of each test case contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    n\n is even) \u2014 the number\nof the columns in the grid. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output\n\n    2\n lines, each containing \n    n\n integers \u2014 the desired grid. If there\nare multiple solutions, output any of them. Example Input 3 2 4 6 Output 3 2 1\n4 8 2 6 4 1 5 3 7 11 5 9 1 7 3 6 10 2 8 4 12 Note In the first test case,\nthere are only two paths from cell \n    (1, 1)\n to cell \n    (2, 2)\n. Their\ncosts are \n    3-1+4=6\n and \n    3-2+4=5\n. Then the minimum cost is \n    5\n,\nwhich is the maximum possible value. In the second test case, there are four\npaths from cell \n    (1, 1)\n to cell \n    (2, 4)\n. Their costs are\n\n    8-1+5-3+7=16\n, \n    8-2+5-3+7=15\n, \n    8-2+6-3+7=16\n, and\n\n    8-2+6-4+7=15\n. Then the minimum value is \n    15\n, which is the maximum\npossible value.\n\n",
