        "description": "A sequence of \n    n\n numbers is called a permutation if it contains all\nintegers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n exactly once. For example, the sequences\n[\n    3, 1, 4, 2\n], [\n    1\n] and [\n    2,1\n] are permutations, but\n[\n    1,2,1\n], [\n    0,1\n] and [\n    1,3,4\n] \u2014 are not. Polycarp lost his\nfavorite permutation and found only some of its elements \u2014 the numbers \n    b_1,\n    b_2, \n    \u2026 b_m\n. He is sure that the sum of the lost elements equals\n\n    s\n. Determine whether one or more numbers can be appended to the given\nsequence \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026 b_m\n such that the sum of the added numbers\nequals \n    s\n, and the resulting new array is a permutation? Input The first\nline of input contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n)\n\u2014the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow. The\nfirst line of each test set contains two integers \n    m\n and \n    s\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 50\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 s \n    \u2264 1000\n)\u2014-the number of found elements\nand the sum of forgotten numbers. The second line of each test set contains\n\n    m\n different integers \n    b_1, b_2 \n    \u2026 b_m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264\n    50\n) \u2014 the elements Polycarp managed to find. Output Print \n    t\n lines,\neach of which is the answer to the corresponding test set. Print as the answer\nYES if you can append several elements to the array \n    b\n, that their sum\nequals \n    s\n and the result will be a permutation. Output NO otherwise. You\ncan output the answer in any case (for example, yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be\nrecognized as positive answer). Example Input 5 3 13 3 1 4 1 1 1 3 3 1 4 2 2 1\n4 3 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 Output YES NO YES NO YES Note In the test case of the\nexample, \n    m=3, s=13, b=[3,1,4]\n. You can append to \n    b\n the numbers\n\n    6,2,5\n, the sum of which is \n    6+2+5=13\n. Note that the final array\nwill become \n    [3,1,4,6,2,5]\n, which is a permutation. In the second test\ncase of the example, \n    m=1, s=1, b=[1]\n. You cannot append one or more\nnumbers to \n    [1]\n such that their sum equals \n    1\n and the result is a\npermutation. In the third test case of the example, \n    m=3, s=3, b=[1,4,2]\n.\nYou can append the number \n    3\n to \n    b\n. Note that the resulting array\nwill be \n    [1,4,2,3]\n, which is a permutation.\n\n",
