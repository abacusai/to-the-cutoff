        "name": "Darth Vader and Tree",
        "description": "When Darth Vader gets bored, he sits down on the sofa, closes his eyes and\nthinks of an infinite rooted tree where each node has exactly n sons, at that\nfor each node, the distance between it an its i-th left child equals to di.\nThe Sith Lord loves counting the number of nodes in the tree that are at a\ndistance at most x from the root. The distance is the sum of the lengths of\nedges on the path between nodes. But he has got used to this activity and even\ngrew bored of it. 'Why does he do that, then?' \u2014 you may ask. It's just that\nhe feels superior knowing that only he can solve this problem. Do you want to\nchallenge Darth Vader himself? Count the required number of nodes. As the\nanswer can be rather large, find it modulo 10^9 + 7. Input The first line\ncontains two space-separated integers n and x (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 10^9) \u2014\nthe number of children of each node and the distance from the root within the\nrange of which you need to count the nodes. The next line contains n space-\nseparated integers di (1 \u2264 di \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the edge that connects\neach node with its i-th child. Output Print a single number \u2014 the number of\nvertexes in the tree at distance from the root equal to at most x. Examples\nInput 3 3 1 2 3 Output 8 Note Pictures to the sample (the yellow color marks\nthe nodes the distance to which is at most three)\n\n",
