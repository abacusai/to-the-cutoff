        "description": "Soroush and Keshi each have a labeled and rooted tree on \n    n\n vertices.\nBoth of their trees are rooted from vertex \n    1\n. Soroush and Keshi used to\nbe at war. After endless decades of fighting, they finally became allies to\nprepare a Codeforces round. To celebrate this fortunate event, they decided to\nmake a memorial graph on \n    n\n vertices. They add an edge between vertices\n\n    u\n and \n    v\n in the memorial graph if both of the following conditions\nhold: One of \n    u\n or \n    v\n is the ancestor of the other in Soroush's\ntree. Neither of \n    u\n or \n    v\n is the ancestor of the other in Keshi's\ntree. Here vertex \n    u\n is considered ancestor of vertex \n    v\n, if \n    u\n\nlies on the path from \n    1\n (the root) to the \n    v\n. Popping out of\nnowhere, Mashtali tried to find the maximum clique in the memorial graph for\nno reason. He failed because the graph was too big. Help Mashtali by finding\nthe size of the maximum clique in the memorial graph. As a reminder, clique is\na subset of vertices of the graph, each two of which are connected by an edge.\nInput The first line contains an integer \n    t\n \n    (1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5)\n \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains an integer \n    n\n\n\n    (2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5)\n. The second line of each test case\ncontains \n    n-1\n integers \n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 a_i < i)\n,\n\n    a_i\n being the parent of the vertex \n    i\n in Soroush's tree. The third\nline of each test case contains \n    n-1\n integers \n    b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n\n\n    (1 \n    \u2264 b_i < i)\n, \n    b_i\n being the parent of the vertex \n    i\n in\nKeshi's tree. It is guaranteed that the given graphs are trees. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed \n    3\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case print a single integer \u2014 the size\nof the maximum clique in the memorial graph.

In the second\ntest case, one of the maximum cliques is \n    2, 3, 4, 5\n. In the\nfourth test case, one of the maximum cliques is \n    3, 4, 6\n.\n\n",
