        "description": "Valery is very interested in magic. Magic attracts him so much that he sees it\neverywhere. He explains any strange and weird phenomenon through intervention\nof supernatural forces. But who would have thought that even in a regular\narray of numbers Valera manages to see something beautiful and magical. Valera\nabsolutely accidentally got a piece of ancient parchment on which an array of\nnumbers was written. He immediately thought that the numbers in this array\nwere not random. As a result of extensive research Valera worked out a\nwonderful property that a magical array should have: an array is defined as\nmagic if its minimum and maximum coincide. He decided to share this\noutstanding discovery with you, but he asks you for help in return. Despite\nthe tremendous intelligence and wit, Valera counts very badly and so you will\nhave to complete his work. All you have to do is count the number of magical\nsubarrays of the original array of numbers, written on the parchment. Subarray\nis defined as non-empty sequence of consecutive elements. Input The first line\nof the input data contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The second line\ncontains an array of original integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 10^9 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9).\nOutput Print on the single line the answer to the problem: the amount of\nsubarrays, which are magical. Please do not use the \nor write 64-bit numbers in C++. It is recommended to use cin, cout streams\n(you can also use the \nInput 5 -2 -2 -2 0 1 Output 8 Note Notes to sample tests: Magical subarrays\nare shown with pairs of indices [a;b] of the beginning and the end. In the\nfirst sample: [1;1], [2;2], [3;3], [4;4], [2;3]. In the second sample: [1;1],\n[2;2], [3;3], [4;4], [5;5], [1;2], [2;3], [1;3].\n\n",
