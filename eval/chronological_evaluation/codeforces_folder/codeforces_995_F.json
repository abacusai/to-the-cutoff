        "description": "Allen, having graduated from the MOO Institute of Techcowlogy (MIT), has\nstarted a startup! Allen is the president of his startup. He also hires\n\n    n-1\n other employees, each of which is assigned a direct superior. If\n\n    u\n is a superior of \n    v\n and \n    v\n is a superior of \n    w\n then\nalso \n    u\n is a superior of \n    w\n. Additionally, there are no \n    u\n and\n\n    v\n such that \n    u\n is the superior of \n    v\n and \n    v\n is the\nsuperior of \n    u\n. Allen himself has no superior. Allen is employee number\n\n    1\n, and the others are employee numbers \n    2\n through \n    n\n. Finally,\nAllen must assign salaries to each employee in the company including himself.\nDue to budget constraints, each employee's salary is an integer between\n\n    1\n and \n    D\n. Additionally, no employee can make strictly more than his\nsuperior. Help Allen find the number of ways to assign salaries. As this\nnumber may be large, output it modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Input The first line of\nthe input contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    D\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    3000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 D \n    \u2264 10^9\n). The remaining \n    n-1\n lines each\ncontain a single positive integer, where the \n    i\n-th line contains the\ninteger \n    p_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 i\n). \n    p_i\n denotes the direct\nsuperior of employee \n    i+1\n. Output Output a single integer: the number of\nways to assign salaries modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Examples Input 3 2 1 1 Output 5\nInput 3 3 1 2 Output 10 Input 2 5 1 Output 15 Note In the first sample case,\nemployee 2 and 3 report directly to Allen. The three salaries, in order, can\nbe \n    (1,1,1)\n, \n    (2,1,1)\n, \n    (2,1,2)\n, \n    (2,2,1)\n or\n\n    (2,2,2)\n. In the second sample case, employee 2 reports to Allen and\nemployee 3 reports to employee 2. In order, the possible salaries are\n\n    (1,1,1)\n, \n    (2,1,1)\n, \n    (2,2,1)\n, \n    (2,2,2)\n, \n    (3,1,1)\n,\n\n    (3,2,1)\n, \n    (3,2,2)\n, \n    (3,3,1)\n, \n    (3,3,2)\n, \n    (3,3,3)\n.\n\n",
