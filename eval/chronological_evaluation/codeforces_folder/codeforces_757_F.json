        "description": "It's the turn of the year, so Bash wants to send presents to his friends.\nThere are n cities in the Himalayan region and they are connected by m\nbidirectional roads. Bash is living in city s. Bash has exactly one friend in\neach of the other cities. Since Bash wants to surprise his friends, he decides\nto send a Pikachu to each of them. Since there may be some cities which are\nnot reachable from Bash's city, he only sends a Pikachu to those friends who\nlive in a city reachable from his own city. He also wants to send it to them\nas soon as possible. He finds out the minimum time for each of his Pikachus to\nreach its destination city. Since he is a perfectionist, he informs all his\nfriends with the time their gift will reach them. A Pikachu travels at a speed\nof 1 meters per second. His friends were excited to hear this and would be\nunhappy if their presents got delayed. Unfortunately Team Rocket is on the\nloose and they came to know of Bash's plan. They want to maximize the number\nof friends who are unhappy with Bash. They do this by destroying exactly one\nof the other n - 1 cities. This implies that the friend residing in that city\ndies, so he is unhappy as well. Note that if a city is destroyed, all the\nroads directly connected to the city are also destroyed and the Pikachu may be\nforced to take a longer alternate route. Please also note that only friends\nthat are waiting for a gift count as unhappy, even if they die. Since Bash is\nalready a legend, can you help Team Rocket this time and find out the maximum\nnumber of Bash's friends who can be made unhappy by destroying exactly one\ncity. Input The first line contains three space separated integers n, m and s\n(2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5, , 1 \u2264 s \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of cities and the number of roads\nin the Himalayan region and the city Bash lives in. Each of the next m lines\ncontain three space-separated integers u, v and w (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v, 1 \u2264 w\n\u2264 10^9) denoting that there exists a road between city u and city v of length\nw meters. It is guaranteed that no road connects a city to itself and there\nare no two roads that connect the same pair of cities. Output Print a single\ninteger, the answer to the problem. Examples Input 4 4 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 4 1 3 1\n1 Output 2 Input 7 11 2 1 2 5 1 3 5 2 4 2 2 5 2 3 6 3 3 7 3 4 6 2 3 4 2 6 7 3\n4 5 7 4 7 7 Output 4 Note In the first sample, on destroying the city 2, the\nlength of shortest distance between pairs of cities (3, 2) and (3, 4) will\nchange. Hence the answer is 2.\n\n",
