        "description": "Walking through the streets of Marshmallow City, Slastyona have spotted some\nmerchants selling a kind of useless toy which is very popular nowadays \u2013\ncaramel spinner! Wanting to join the craze, she has immediately bought the\nstrange contraption. Spinners in Sweetland have the form of V-shaped pieces of\ncaramel. Each spinner can, well, spin around an invisible magic axis. At a\nspecific point in time, a spinner can take 4 positions shown below (each one\nrotated 90 degrees relative to the previous, with the fourth one followed by\nthe first one): After the spinner was spun, it starts its rotation, which is\ndescribed by a following algorithm: the spinner maintains its position for a\nsecond then majestically switches to the next position in clockwise or\ncounter-clockwise order, depending on the direction the spinner was spun in.\nSlastyona managed to have spinner rotating for exactly n seconds. Being\nfascinated by elegance of the process, she completely forgot the direction the\nspinner was spun in! Lucky for her, she managed to recall the starting\nposition, and wants to deduct the direction given the information she knows.\nHelp her do this. Input There are two characters in the first string \u2013 the\nstarting and the ending position of a spinner. The position is encoded with\none of the following characters: v (ASCII code 118, lowercase v), < (ASCII\ncode 60), ^ (ASCII code 94) or > (ASCII code 62) (see the picture above for\nreference). Characters are separated by a single space. In the second strings,\na single number n is given (0 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9) \u2013 the duration of the rotation. It\nis guaranteed that the ending position of a spinner is a result of a n second\nspin in any of the directions, assuming the given starting position. Output\nOutput cw, if the direction is clockwise, ccw \u2013 if counter-clockwise, and\nundefined otherwise. Examples Input ^ > 1 Output cw Input < ^ 3 Output ccw\nInput ^ v 6 Output undefined\n\n",
