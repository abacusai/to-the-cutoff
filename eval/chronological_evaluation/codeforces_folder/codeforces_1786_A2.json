        "description": "This is a hard version of the problem. In this version, there are two colors\nof the cards. Alice has \n    n\n cards, each card is either black or white. The\ncards are stacked in a deck in such a way that the card colors alternate,\nstarting from a white card. Alice deals the cards to herself and to Bob,\ndealing at once several cards from the top of the deck in the following order:\none card to herself, two cards to Bob, three cards to Bob, four cards to\nherself, five cards to herself, six cards to Bob, seven cards to Bob, eight\ncards to herself, and so on. In other words, on the \n    i\n-th step, Alice\ndeals \n    i\n top cards from the deck to one of the players; on the first\nstep, she deals the cards to herself and then alternates the players every two\nsteps. When there aren't enough cards at some step, Alice deals all the\nremaining cards to the current player, and the process stops. First Alice's\nsteps in a deck of many cards. How many cards of each color will Alice and Bob\nhave at the end? Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 200\n). The\ndescription of the test cases follows The only line of each test case contains\na single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number of cards.\nOutput For each test case print four integers \u2014 the number of cards in the end\nfor each player \u2014 in this order: white cards Alice has, black cards Alice has,\nwhite cards Bob has, black cards Bob has. Example Input 5 10 6 17 8 1000000\nOutput 3 2 2 3 1 0 2 3 6 4 3 4 2 1 2 3 250278 249924 249722 250076\n\n",
