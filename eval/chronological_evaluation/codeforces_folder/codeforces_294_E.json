        "description": "The great Shaass is the new king of the Drakht empire. The empire has n cities\nwhich are connected by n - 1 bidirectional roads. Each road has an specific\nlength and connects a pair of cities. There's a unique simple path connecting\neach pair of cities. His majesty the great Shaass has decided to tear down one\nof the roads and build another road with the same length between some pair of\ncities. He should build such road that it's still possible to travel from each\ncity to any other city. He might build the same road again. You as his advisor\nshould help him to find a way to make the described action. You should find\nthe way that minimize the total sum of pairwise distances between cities after\nthe action. So calculate the minimum sum. Input The first line of the input\ncontains an integer n denoting the number of cities in the empire, (2 \u2264 n \u2264\n5000). The next n - 1 lines each contains three integers ai, bi and wi showing\nthat two cities ai and bi are connected using a road of length wi, (1 \u2264 ai, bi\n\u2264 n, ai \u2260 bi, 1 \u2264 wi \u2264 10^6). Output On the only line of the output print the\nminimum pairwise sum of distances between the cities. Please do not use the\n\nuse the cin, cout streams or the \n3 4 Output 12 Input 6 1 2 1 2 3 1 3 4 1 4 5 1 5 6 1 Output 29 Input 6 1 3 1 2\n3 1 3 4 100 4 5 2 4 6 1 Output 825\n\n",
