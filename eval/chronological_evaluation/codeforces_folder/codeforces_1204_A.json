        "description": "In the city of Saint Petersburg, a day lasts for \n    2^100\n minutes. From\nthe main station of Saint Petersburg, a train departs after \n    1\n minute,\n\n    4\n minutes, \n    16\n minutes, and so on; in other words, the train\ndeparts at time \n    4^k\n for each integer \n    k \n    \u2265 0\n. Team BowWow has\narrived at the station at the time \n    s\n and it is trying to count how many\ntrains have they missed; in other words, the number of trains that have\ndeparted strictly before time \n    s\n. For example if \n    s = 20\n, then they\nmissed trains which have departed at \n    1\n, \n    4\n and \n    16\n. As you are\nthe only one who knows the time, help them! Note that the number \n    s\n will\nbe given you in a binary representation without leading zeroes. Input The\nfirst line contains a single binary number \n    s\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 s <\n    2^100\n) without leading zeroes. Output Output a single number \u2014 the number\nof trains which have departed strictly before the time \n    s\n. Examples Input\n100000000 Output 4 Input 101 Output 2 Input 10100 Output 3 Note In the first\nexample \n    100000000_2 = 256_10\n, missed trains have departed at \n    1\n,\n\n    4\n, \n    16\n and \n    64\n. In the second example \n    101_2 = 5_10\n,\ntrains have departed at \n    1\n and \n    4\n. The third example is explained in\nthe statements.\n\n",
