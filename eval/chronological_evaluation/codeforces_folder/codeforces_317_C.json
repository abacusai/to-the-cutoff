        "description": "A system of n vessels with water is given. Several pairs of vessels are\nconnected by tubes with transfusion mechanisms. One may transfer an integer\namount of liters of water between two vessels connected by such tube (tube\nworks in both directions). There might be multiple tubes between two vessels.\nTotal number of tubes equals e. Volume of each vessel equals v liters. Of\ncourse, the amount of the water in any vessel cannot exceed v liters in the\nprocess of transfusions. Given the initial amounts ai of water in the vessels\nand the desired amounts bi find a sequence of transfusions that deals with the\ntask. Total number of transfusions must not exceed 2\u00b7n^2. Input First line of\nthe input contains integers n, v, e (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300, 1 \u2264 v \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 e \u2264\n50000). Next two lines contain n integers each: initial ai and the desired\namounts bi of water in corresponding vessels (0 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 v). Next e lines\ndescribe one tube each in the format x y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n, x \u2260 y) for a tube\nbetween vessels number x and y. There might be multiple tubes between two\nvessels. You may assume that vessels are numbered from 1 to n in some way.\nOutput Print \"NO\" (without quotes), if such sequence of transfusions does not\nexist. Otherwise print any suitable sequence in the following format. On the\nfirst line print the total number of transfusions k (k should not exceed\n2\u00b7n^2). In the following k lines print transfusions in the format x y d\n(transfusion of d liters from the vessel number x to the vessel number y, x\nand y must be distinct). For all transfusions d must be a non-negative\ninteger. Examples Input 2 10 1 1 9 5 5 1 2 Output 1 2 1 4 Input 2 10 0 5 2 4 2\nOutput NO Input 2 10 0 4 2 4 2 Output 0\n\n",
