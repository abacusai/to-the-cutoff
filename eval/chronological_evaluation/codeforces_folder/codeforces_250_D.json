        "description": "Two villages are separated by a river that flows from the north to the south.\nThe villagers want to build a bridge across the river to make it easier to\nmove across the villages. The river banks can be assumed to be vertical\nstraight lines x = a and x = b (0 < a < b). The west village lies in a steppe\nat point O = (0, 0). There are n pathways leading from the village to the\nriver, they end at points Ai = (a, yi). The villagers there are plain and\nsimple, so their pathways are straight segments as well. The east village has\nreserved and cunning people. Their village is in the forest on the east bank\nof the river, but its exact position is not clear. There are m twisted paths\nleading from this village to the river and ending at points Bi = (b, y'i). The\nlengths of all these paths are known, the length of the path that leads from\nthe eastern village to point Bi, equals li. The villagers want to choose\nexactly one point on the left bank of river Ai, exactly one point on the right\nbank Bj and connect them by a straight-line bridge so as to make the total\ndistance between the villages (the sum of |OAi| + |AiBj| + lj, where |XY| is\nthe Euclidean distance between points X and Y) were minimum. The Euclidean\ndistance between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) equals . Help them and find the\nrequired pair of points. Input The first line contains integers n, m, a, b (1\n\u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5, 0 < a < b < 10^6). The second line contains n integers in the\nascending order: the i-th integer determines the coordinate of point Ai and\nequals yi (|yi| \u2264 10^6). The third line contains m integers in the ascending\norder: the i-th integer determines the coordinate of point Bi and equals y'i\n(|y'i| \u2264 10^6). The fourth line contains m more integers: the i-th of them\ndetermines the length of the path that connects the eastern village and point\nBi, and equals li (1 \u2264 li \u2264 10^6). It is guaranteed, that there is such a\npoint C with abscissa at least b, that |BiC| \u2264 li for all i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 m). It is\nguaranteed that no two points Ai coincide. It is guaranteed that no two points\nBi coincide. Output Print two integers \u2014 the numbers of points on the left\n(west) and right (east) banks, respectively, between which you need to build a\nbridge. You can assume that the points on the west bank are numbered from 1 to\nn, in the order in which they are given in the input. Similarly, the points on\nthe east bank are numbered from 1 to m in the order in which they are given in\nthe input. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. The solution\nwill be accepted if the final length of the path will differ from the answer\nof the jury by no more than 10^-6 in absolute or relative value. Examples\nInput 3 2 3 5 -2 -1 4 -1 2 7 3 Output 2 2\n\n",
