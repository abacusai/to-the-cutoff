        "description": "The polar bears have discovered a gigantic circular piece of floating ice with\nsome mystic carvings on it. There are n lines carved on the ice. Each line\nconnects two points on the boundary of the ice (we call these points\nendpoints). The endpoints are numbered 1, 2, ..., 2n counter-clockwise along\nthe circumference. No two lines share an endpoint. Now a group of 6 polar\nbears (Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Eve, Frank) are going to build caves on the\nendpoints. Each polar bear would build a cave and live in it. No two polar\nbears can build a cave on the same endpoints. Alice and Bob is a pair of\nsuperstitious lovers. They believe the lines are carved by aliens (or humans,\nwhich are pretty much the same thing to polar bears), and have certain\nspiritual power. Therefore they want to build their caves on two endpoints\nwhich are connected by a line. The same for Carol and Dave, Eve and Frank. The\ndistance between two caves X and Y is defined as one plus minimum number of\nother caves one need to pass through in order to travel from X to Y along the\nboundary of the ice (endpoints without caves are not counted). To ensure\nfairness, the distances between the three pairs of lovers have to be the same\n(that is, the distance between Alice and Bob, the distance between Carol and\nDave, and the distance between Eve and Frank are the same). The figures below\nshow two different configurations, where the dots on the circle are the\nendpoints. The configuration on the left is not valid. Although each pair of\nlovers (A and B, C and D, E and F) is connected a line, the distance\nrequirement is not satisfied. The distance between A and B is 2 (one can go\nfrom A to B in the clockwise direction passing through F). The distance\nbetween E and F is also 2. However, the distance between C and D is 1 (one can\ngo from C to D in the counter-clockwise direction without passing through any\nother caves). The configuration on the right is valid. All three pairs have\nthe same distance 1. Count the number of ways to build the caves under the\nrequirements. Two configurations are considered the same if the same set of 6\nendpoints are used. Input The first line contains integer n(3 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014\nthe number of lines. Each of the following n lines contains two integers ai,\nbi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 2n), which means that there is a line carved on the ice\nconnecting the ai\u2013th and bi\u2013th endpoint. It's guaranteed that each endpoints\ntouches exactly one line. Output Print the number of ways to build the caves.\nPlease, do not write the \n\u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the \nExamples Input 4 5 4 1 2 6 7 8 3 Output 2 Input 8 1 7 2 4 3 9 5 11 6 8 10 16\n13 15 14 12 Output 6 Note The second sample corresponds to the figure in the\nproblem statement.\n\n",
