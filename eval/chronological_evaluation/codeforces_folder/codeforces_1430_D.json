        "description": "You have a string \n    s\n consisting of \n    n\n characters. Each character is\neither 0 or 1. You can perform operations on the string. Each operation\nconsists of two steps: select an integer \n    i\n from \n    1\n to the length of\nthe string \n    s\n, then delete the character \n    s_i\n (the string length\ngets reduced by \n    1\n, the indices of characters to the right of the deleted\none also get reduced by \n    1\n); if the string \n    s\n is not empty, delete\nthe maximum length prefix consisting of the same characters (the indices of\nthe remaining characters and the string length get reduced by the length of\nthe deleted prefix). Note that both steps are mandatory in each operation, and\ntheir order cannot be changed. For example, if you have a string \n    s =\n\n111010, the first operation can be one of the following: select \n    i = 1\n:\nwe'll get 111010 \n    \u2192\n 11010 \n    \u2192\n 010; select\n\n    i = 2\n: we'll get 111010 \n    \u2192\n 11010 \n    \u2192\n\n010; select \n    i = 3\n: we'll get 111010 \n    \u2192\n 11010\n\n    \u2192\n 010; select \n    i = 4\n: we'll get 111010\n\n    \u2192\n 11110 \n    \u2192\n 0; select \n    i = 5\n: we'll get\n111010 \n    \u2192\n 11100 \n    \u2192\n 00; select \n    i = 6\n:\nwe'll get 111010 \n    \u2192\n 11101 \n    \u2192\n 01. You finish\nperforming operations when the string \n    s\n becomes empty. What is the\nmaximum number of operations you can perform? Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the string \n    s\n. The\nsecond line contains string \n    s\n of \n    n\n characters. Each character is\neither 0 or 1. It's guaranteed that the total sum of \n    n\n over test cases\ndoesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print a single\ninteger \u2014 the maximum number of operations you can perform. Example Input 5 6\n111010 1 0 1 1 2 11 6 101010 Output 3 1 1 1 3 Note In the first test case, you\ncan, for example, select \n    i = 2\n and get string 010 after the first\noperation. After that, you can select \n    i = 3\n and get string 1. Finally,\nyou can only select \n    i = 1\n and get empty string.\n\n",
