        "description": "A bracket sequence is called regular if it is possible to obtain correct\narithmetic expression by inserting characters \u00ab+\u00bb and \u00ab1\u00bb into this sequence.\nFor example, sequences \u00ab(())()\u00bb, \u00ab()\u00bb and \u00ab(()(()))\u00bb are regular, while \u00ab)(\u00bb,\n\u00ab(()\u00bb and \u00ab(()))(\u00bb are not. One day Johnny got bracket sequence. He decided to\nremove some of the brackets from it in order to obtain a regular bracket\nsequence. What is the maximum length of a regular bracket sequence which can\nbe obtained? Input Input consists of a single line with non-empty string of\n\u00ab(\u00bb and \u00ab)\u00bb characters. Its length does not exceed 10^6. Output Output the\nmaximum possible length of a regular bracket sequence. Examples Input (()))(\nOutput 4 Input ((()()) Output 6\n\n",
