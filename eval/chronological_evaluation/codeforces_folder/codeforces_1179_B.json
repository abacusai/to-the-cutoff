        "description": "This morning Tolik has understood that while he was sleeping he had invented\nan incredible problem which will be a perfect fit for Codeforces! But, as a\n\"Discuss tasks\" project hasn't been born yet (in English, well), he decides to\ntest a problem and asks his uncle. After a long time thinking, Tolik's uncle\nhasn't any ideas on how to solve it. But, he doesn't want to tell Tolik about\nhis inability to solve it, so he hasn't found anything better than asking you\nhow to solve this task. In this task you are given a cell field \n    n \n    \u00b7\n    m\n, consisting of \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n columns, where point's\ncoordinates \n    (x, y)\n mean it is situated in the \n    x\n-th row and\n\n    y\n-th column, considering numeration from one (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 n, 1\n    \n    \u2264 y \n    \u2264 m\n). Initially, you stand in the cell \n    (1, 1)\n. Every\nmove you can jump from cell \n    (x, y)\n, which you stand in, by any non-zero\nvector \n    (dx, dy)\n, thus you will stand in the \n    (x+dx, y+dy)\n cell.\nObviously, you can't leave the field, but also there is one more important\ncondition \u2014 you're not allowed to use one vector twice. Your task is to visit\neach cell of the field exactly once (the initial cell is considered as already\nvisited). Tolik's uncle is a very respectful person. Help him to solve this\ntask! Input The first and only line contains two positive integers \n    n, m\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u00b7 m \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of\nthe field respectively. Output Print \"-1\" (without quotes) if it is impossible\nto visit every cell exactly once. Else print \n    n \n    \u00b7 m\n pairs of\nintegers, \n    i\n-th from them should contain two integers \n    x_i, y_i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 n, 1 \n    \u2264 y_i \n    \u2264 m\n) \u2014 cells of the field in\norder of visiting, so that all of them are distinct and vectors of jumps\nbetween them are distinct too. Notice that the first cell should have \n    (1,\n    1)\n coordinates, according to the statement. Examples Input 2 3 Output 1 1 1\n3 1 2 2 2 2 3 2 1 Input 1 1 Output 1 1 Note The vectors from the first example\nin the order of making jumps are \n    (0, 2), (0, -1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0,\n    -2)\n.\n\n",
