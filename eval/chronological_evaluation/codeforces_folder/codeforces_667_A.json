        "description": "A lot of people in Berland hates rain, but you do not. Rain pacifies, puts\nyour thoughts in order. By these years you have developed a good tradition \u2014\nwhen it rains, you go on the street and stay silent for a moment, contemplate\nall around you, enjoy freshness, think about big deeds you have to do. Today\neverything had changed quietly. You went on the street with a cup contained\nwater, your favorite drink. In a moment when you were drinking a water you\nnoticed that the process became quite long: the cup still contained water\nbecause of rain. You decided to make a formal model of what was happening and\nto find if it was possible to drink all water in that situation. Thus, your\ncup is a cylinder with diameter equals d centimeters. Initial level of water\nin cup equals h centimeters from the bottom. You drink a water with a speed\nequals v milliliters per second. But rain goes with such speed that if you do\nnot drink a water from the cup, the level of water increases on e centimeters\nper second. The process of drinking water from the cup and the addition of\nrain to the cup goes evenly and continuously. Find the time needed to make the\ncup empty or find that it will never happen. It is guaranteed that if it is\npossible to drink all water, it will happen not later than after 10^4 seconds.\nNote one milliliter equals to one cubic centimeter. Input The only line of the\ninput contains four integer numbers d, h, v, e (1 \u2264 d, h, v, e \u2264 10^4), where:\nd \u2014 the diameter of your cylindrical cup, h \u2014 the initial level of water in\nthe cup, v \u2014 the speed of drinking process from the cup in milliliters per\nsecond, e \u2014 the growth of water because of rain if you do not drink from the\ncup. Output If it is impossible to make the cup empty, print \"NO\" (without\nquotes). Otherwise print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the first line. In the\nsecond line print a real number \u2014 time in seconds needed the cup will be\nempty. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error\ndoesn't exceed 10^-4. It is guaranteed that if the answer exists, it doesn't\nexceed 10^4. Examples Input 1 2 3 100 Output NO Input 1 1 1 1 Output YES\n3.659792366325 Note In the first example the water fills the cup faster than\nyou can drink from it. In the second example area of the cup's bottom equals\nto , thus we can conclude that you decrease the level of water by centimeters\nper second. At the same time water level increases by 1 centimeter per second\ndue to rain. Thus, cup will be empty in seconds.\n\n",
