        "description": "Smith wakes up at the side of a dirty, disused bathroom, his ankle chained to\npipes. Next to him is tape-player with a hand-written message \"Play Me\". He\nfinds a tape in his own back pocket. After putting the tape in the tape-\nplayer, he sees a key hanging from a ceiling, chained to some kind of a\nmachine, which is connected to the terminal next to him. After pressing a Play\nbutton a rough voice starts playing from the tape: \"Listen up Smith. As you\ncan see, you are in pretty tough situation and in order to escape, you have to\nsolve a puzzle. You are given N strings which represent words. Each word is of\nthe maximum length L and consists of characters 'a'-'e'. You are also given M\nstrings which represent patterns. Pattern is a string of length \u2264 L and\nconsists of characters 'a'-'e' as well as the maximum 3 characters '?'.\nCharacter '?' is an unknown character, meaning it can be equal to any\ncharacter 'a'-'e', or even an empty character. For each pattern find the\nnumber of words that matches with the given pattern. After solving it and\ntyping the result in the terminal, the key will drop from the ceiling and you\nmay escape. Let the game begin.\" Help Smith escape. Input The first line of\ninput contains two integers N and M (1 \u2264 N \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 M \u2264 5000),\nrepresenting the number of words and patterns respectively. The next N lines\nrepresent each word, and after those N lines, following M lines represent each\npattern. Each word and each pattern has a maximum length L (1 \u2264 L \u2264 50). Each\npattern has no more that three characters '?'. All other characters in words\nand patters are lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'e'. Output Output\ncontains M lines and each line consists of one integer, representing the\nnumber of words that match the corresponding pattern. Example Input 3 1 abc\naec ac a?c Output 3 Note If we switch '?' with 'b', 'e' and with empty\ncharacter, we get 'abc', 'aec' and 'ac' respectively.\n\n",
