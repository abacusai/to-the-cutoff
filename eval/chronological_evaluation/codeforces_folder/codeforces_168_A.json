        "description": "Some country is populated by wizards. They want to organize a demonstration.\nThere are n people living in the city, x of them are the wizards who will\nsurely go to the demonstration. Other city people (n - x people) do not\nsupport the wizards and aren't going to go to the demonstration. We know that\nthe city administration will react only to the demonstration involving at\nleast y percent of the city people. Having considered the matter, the wizards\ndecided to create clone puppets which can substitute the city people on the\ndemonstration. So all in all, the demonstration will involve only the wizards\nand their puppets. The city administration cannot tell the difference between\na puppet and a person, so, as they calculate the percentage, the\nadministration will consider the city to be consisting of only n people and\nnot containing any clone puppets. Help the wizards and find the minimum number\nof clones to create to that the demonstration had no less than y percent of\nthe city people. Input The first line contains three space-separated integers,\nn, x, y (1 \u2264 n, x, y \u2264 10^4, x \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of citizens in the city, the\nnumber of wizards and the percentage the administration needs,\ncorrespondingly. Please note that y can exceed 100 percent, that is, the\nadministration wants to see on a demonstration more people that actually live\nin the city ( > n). Output Print a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem,\nthe minimum number of clones to create, so that the demonstration involved no\nless than y percent of n (the real total city population). Examples Input 10 1\n14 Output 1 Input 20 10 50 Output 0 Input 1000 352 146 Output 1108 Note In the\nfirst sample it is necessary that at least 14\ndemonstration. As the number of people should be integer, then at least two\npeople should come. There is only one wizard living in the city and he is\ngoing to come. That isn't enough, so he needs to create one clone. In the\nsecond sample 10 people should come to the demonstration. The city has 10\nwizards. They will all come to the demonstration, so nobody has to create any\nclones.\n\n",
