        "description": "There are n cities located along the one-way road. Cities are numbered from 1\nto n in the direction of the road. The i-th city had produced pi units of\ngoods. No more than si units of goods can be sold in the i-th city. For each\npair of cities i and j such that 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n you can no more than once\ntransport no more than c units of goods from the city i to the city j. Note\nthat goods can only be transported from a city with a lesser index to the city\nwith a larger index. You can transport goods between cities in any order.\nDetermine the maximum number of produced goods that can be sold in total in\nall the cities after a sequence of transportations. Input The first line of\nthe input contains two integers n and c (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10 000, 0 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the\nnumber of cities and the maximum amount of goods for a single transportation.\nThe second line contains n integers pi (0 \u2264 pi \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of units\nof goods that were produced in each city. The third line of input contains n\nintegers si (0 \u2264 si \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number of units of goods that can be sold in\neach city. Output Print the maximum total number of produced goods that can be\nsold in all cities after a sequence of transportations.
