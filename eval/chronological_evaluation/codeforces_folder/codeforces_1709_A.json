        "description": "There are three doors in front of you, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    3\n from\nleft to right. Each door has a lock on it, which can only be opened with a key\nwith the same number on it as the number on the door. There are three keys \u2014\none for each door. Two of them are hidden behind the doors, so that there is\nno more than one key behind each door. So two doors have one key behind them,\none door doesn't have a key behind it. To obtain a key hidden behind a door,\nyou should first unlock that door. The remaining key is in your hands. Can you\nopen all the doors? Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 18\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. The first line of each\ntestcase contains a single integer \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 3\n) \u2014 the\nnumber on the key in your hands. The second line contains three integers \n    a,\n    b\n and \n    c\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a, b, c \n    \u2264 3\n) \u2014 the number on the key\nbehind each of the doors. If there is no key behind the door, the number is\nequal to \n    0\n. Values \n    1, 2\n and \n    3\n appear exactly once among\n\n    x, a, b\n and \n    c\n. Output For each testcase, print \"YES\" if you can\nopen all the doors. Otherwise, print \"NO\". Example Input 4 3 0 1 2 1 0 3 2 2 3\n1 0 2 1 3 0 Output YES NO YES NO\n\n",
