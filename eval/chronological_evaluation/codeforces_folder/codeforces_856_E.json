        "description": "Real Cosmic Communications is the largest telecommunication company on a far\nfar away planet, located at the very edge of the universe. RCC launches\ncommunication satellites. The planet is at the very edge of the universe, so\nits form is half of a circle. Its radius is r, the ends of its diameter are\npoints A and B. The line AB is the edge of the universe, so one of the half-\nplanes contains nothing, neither the planet, nor RCC satellites, nor anything\nelse. Let us introduce coordinates in the following way: the origin is at the\ncenter of AB segment, OX axis coincides with line AB, the planet is completely\nin y > 0 half-plane. The satellite can be in any point of the universe, except\nthe planet points. Satellites are never located beyond the edge of the\nuniverse, nor on the edge itself \u2014 that is, they have coordinate y > 0.\nSatellite antennas are directed in such way that they cover the angle with the\nvertex in the satellite, and edges directed to points A and B. Let us call\nthis area the satellite coverage area. The picture below shows coordinate\nsystem and coverage area of a satellite. When RCC was founded there were no\nsatellites around the planet. Since then there have been several events of one\nof the following types: 1 x y \u2014 launch the new satellite and put it to the\npoint (x, y). Satellites never move and stay at the point they were launched.\nLet us assign the number i to the i-th satellite in order of launching,\nstarting from one. 2 i \u2014 remove satellite number i. 3 i j \u2014 make an attempt to\ncreate a communication channel between satellites i and j. To create a\ncommunication channel a repeater is required. It must not be located inside\nthe planet, but can be located at its half-circle border, or above it.\nRepeater must be in coverage area of both satellites i and j. To avoid signal\ninterference, it must not be located in coverage area of any other satellite.\nOf course, the repeater must be within the universe, it must have a coordinate\ny > 0. For each attempt to create a communication channel you must find out\nwhether it is possible. Sample test has the following satellites locations:\nInput The first line of input data contains integers r and n \u2014 radius of the\nplanet and the number of events (1 \u2264 r \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 5\u00b710^5). Each of the\nfollowing n lines describe events in the specified format. Satellite\ncoordinates are integer, the satisfy the following constraints |x| \u2264 10^9, 0 <\ny \u2264 10^9. No two satellites that simultaneously exist can occupy the same\npoint. Distance from each satellite to the center of the planet is strictly\ngreater than r. It is guaranteed that events of types 2 and 3 only refer to\nsatellites that exist at the moment. For all events of type 3 the inequality i\n\u2260 j is satisfied. Output For each event of type 3 print \u00abYES\u00bb on a separate\nline, if it is possible to create a communication channel, or \u00abNO\u00bb if it is\nimpossible. Example Input 5 8 1 -5 8 1 -4 8 1 -3 8 1 2 7 3 1 3 2 2 3 1 3 3 3 4\nOutput NO YES YES\n\n",
