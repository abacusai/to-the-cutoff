        "description": "Madoka decided to participate in an underground sports programming\ncompetition. And there was exactly one task in it: A square table of size \n    n\n    \n    \u00d7 n\n, where \n    n\n is a multiple of \n    k\n, is called good if only\nthe characters '.' and 'X' are written in it, as well as in any subtable of\nsize \n    1 \n    \u00d7 k\n or \n    k \n    \u00d7 1\n, there is at least one character\n'X'. In other words, among any \n    k\n consecutive vertical or horizontal\ncells, there must be at least one containing the character 'X'. Output any\ngood table that has the minimum possible number of characters 'X', and also\nthe symbol 'X' is written in the cell \n    (r, c)\n. Rows are numbered from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n from top to bottom, columns are numbered from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n from left to right. Input The input consists of multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first and\nthe only line of each test case contains four integers \n    n\n, \n    k\n,\n\n    r\n, \n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 500, 1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n, 1 \n    \u2264 r, c\n    \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the size of the table, the integer \n    k\n and the coordinates\nof the cell, which must contain the character 'X'. It is guaranteed that\n\n    n\n is a multiple of \n    k\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n\nover all test cases does not exceed \n    500\n. Output For each test case,\noutput \n    n\n lines, each consisting of \n    n\n characters '.' and 'X', \u2014 the\ndesired table. If there are several answers, then you can output anyone.\nExample Input 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 2 6 3 4 2 Output X.. ..X .X. XX XX .X..X. X..X..\n..X..X .X..X. X..X.. ..X..X Note Let's analyze the first test case. The\nfollowing tables can be printed as the correct answer: X....X.X. or ..XX...X.\nIt can be proved that there cannot be less than \n    3\n characters 'X' in the\nanswer.Note that the following table is invalid because cell \n    (3, 2)\n does\nnot contain the character 'X': X...X...X In the second test case, the only\ncorrect table is: XXXX Each subtable of size \n    1 \n    \u00d7 1\n must contain a\n'X' character, so all characters in the table must be equal to 'X'.\n\n",
