        "description": "Permutation p is an ordered set of integers p1, p2, ..., pn, consisting of n\ndistinct positive integers, each of them doesn't exceed n. We'll denote the\ni-th element of permutation p as pi. We'll call number n the size or the\nlength of permutation p1, p2, ..., pn. Petya decided to introduce the sum\noperation on the set of permutations of length n. Let's assume that we are\ngiven two permutations of length n: a1, a2, ..., an and b1, b2, ..., bn. Petya\ncalls the sum of permutations a and b such permutation c of length n, where ci\n= ((ai - 1 + bi - 1) mod n) + 1 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n). Operation means taking the\nremainder after dividing number x by number y. Obviously, not for all\npermutations a and b exists permutation c that is sum of a and b. That's why\nPetya got sad and asked you to do the following: given n, count the number of\nsuch pairs of permutations a and b of length n, that exists permutation c that\nis sum of a and b. The pair of permutations x, y (x \u2260 y) and the pair of\npermutations y, x are considered distinct pairs. As the answer can be rather\nlarge, print the remainder after dividing it by 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Input\nThe single line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 16). Output In the single line\nprint a single non-negative integer \u2014 the number of such pairs of permutations\na and b, that exists permutation c that is sum of a and b, modulo 1000000007\n(10^9 + 7). Examples Input 3 Output 18 Input 5 Output 1800\n\n",
