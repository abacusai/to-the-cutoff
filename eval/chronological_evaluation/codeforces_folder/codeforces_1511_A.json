        "description": "You are an upcoming movie director, and you have just released your first\nmovie. You have also launched a simple review site with two buttons to press \u2014\nupvote and downvote. However, the site is not so simple on the inside. There\nare two servers, each with its separate counts for the upvotes and the\ndownvotes. \n    n\n reviewers enter the site one by one. Each reviewer is one\nof the following types: type \n    1\n: a reviewer has watched the movie, and\nthey like it \u2014 they press the upvote button; type \n    2\n: a reviewer has\nwatched the movie, and they dislike it \u2014 they press the downvote button; type\n\n    3\n: a reviewer hasn't watched the movie \u2014 they look at the current number\nof upvotes and downvotes of the movie on the server they are in and decide\nwhat button to press. If there are more downvotes than upvotes, then a\nreviewer downvotes the movie. Otherwise, they upvote the movie. Each reviewer\nvotes on the movie exactly once. Since you have two servers, you can actually\nmanipulate the votes so that your movie gets as many upvotes as possible. When\na reviewer enters a site, you know their type, and you can send them either to\nthe first server or to the second one. What is the maximum total number of\nupvotes you can gather over both servers if you decide which server to send\neach reviewer to? Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. Then the descriptions of\n\n    t\n testcases follow. The first line of each testcase contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the number of reviewers. The\nsecond line of each testcase contains \n    n\n integers \n    r_1, r_2, \n    \u2026,\n    r_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 3\n) \u2014 the types of the reviewers in the same\norder they enter the site. Output For each testcase print a single integer \u2014\nthe maximum total number of upvotes you can gather over both servers if you\ndecide which server to send each reviewer to. Example Input 4 1 2 3 1 2 3 5 1\n1 1 1 1 3 3 3 2 Output 0 2 5 2 Note In the first testcase of the example you\ncan send the only reviewer to either of the servers \u2014 they'll downvote anyway.\nThe movie won't receive any upvotes. In the second testcase of the example you\ncan send all reviewers to the first server: the first reviewer upvotes; the\nsecond reviewer downvotes; the last reviewer sees that the number of downvotes\nis not greater than the number of upvotes \u2014 upvote themselves. There are two\nupvotes in total. Alternatevely, you can send the first and the second\nreviewers to the first server and the last reviewer \u2014 to the second server:\nthe first reviewer upvotes on the first server; the second reviewer downvotes\non the first server; the last reviewer sees no upvotes or downvotes on the\nsecond server \u2014 upvote themselves.\n\n",
