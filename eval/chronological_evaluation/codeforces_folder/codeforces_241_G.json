        "description": "Martha \u2014 as a professional problemsetter \u2014 proposed a problem for a world-\nclass contest. This is the problem statement: Tomorrow is Nadia's birthday,\nand Bardia (her brother) is assigned to make the balloons ready! There are n\nballoons (initially empty) that are tied to a straight line on certain\npositions x1, x2, ..., xn. Bardia inflates the balloons from left to right. As\na result, i-th balloon gets bigger and bigger until its radius reaches the\npressure endurance pi or it touches another previously-inflated balloon. While\nBardia was busy with the balloons, he wondered \"What will be the sum of radius\nof balloons after all of the balloons are inflated?\". Being a nerdy type of\nguy, he is now thinking about the problem instead of preparing his sister's\nbirthday. Calculate the answer to Bardia's problem so that Nadia's birthday\nwon't be balloon-less. Artha \u2014 Martha's student \u2014 claimed his solution got\naccepted. Martha (being his teacher for a long time!) knew he couldn't have\nsolved the problem for real and thus thinks there is something wrong with the\ntestcases. Artha isn't anyhow logical, which means there is no way for Martha\nto explain the wrong point in his algorithm. So, the only way is to find a\ntestcase to prove him wrong! Artha's pseudo-code is shown below: You should\noutput a small testcase for the problem such that Artha's algorithm is\nincorrect. The algorithm's output is considered correct if it differs from the\ncorrect value by no more than 1. Input Please pay attention! No input will be\ngiven to your program for this problem. So you do not have to read from the\ninput anything. Output You should output the generated small testcase (which\nArtha's solution doesn't get it right). It should be in the following format:\nFirst line must contain the only number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 500). The i-th of the next\nn lines should contain the description of the i-th balloon \u2014 two space-\nseparated integers xi, pi (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 10^6, 0 \u2264 x1 < x2 < ... < xn \u2264 10^6).\nExamples Note The testcase depicted in the figure above (just showing how\noutput should be formatted): 4 0 9 6 3 12 7 17 1\n\n",
