        "description": "It's one more school day now. Sasha doesn't like classes and is always bored\nat them. So, each day he invents some game and plays in it alone or with\nfriends. Today he invented one simple game to play with Lena, with whom he\nshares a desk. The rules are simple. Sasha draws n sticks in a row. After that\nthe players take turns crossing out exactly k sticks from left or right in\neach turn. Sasha moves first, because he is the inventor of the game. If there\nare less than k sticks on the paper before some turn, the game ends. Sasha\nwins if he makes strictly more moves than Lena. Sasha wants to know the result\nof the game before playing, you are to help him. Input The first line contains\ntwo integers n and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 10^18, k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of sticks drawn by\nSasha and the number k \u2014 the number of sticks to be crossed out on each turn.\nOutput If Sasha wins, print \"YES\" (without quotes), otherwise print \"NO\"\n(without quotes). You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper of\nlower). Examples Input 1 1 Output YES Input 10 4 Output NO Note In the first\nexample Sasha crosses out 1 stick, and then there are no sticks. So Lena can't\nmake a move, and Sasha wins. In the second example Sasha crosses out 4 sticks,\nthen Lena crosses out 4 sticks, and after that there are only 2 sticks left.\nSasha can't make a move. The players make equal number of moves, so Sasha\ndoesn't win.\n\n",
