        "description": "You are both a shop keeper and a shop assistant at a small nearby shop. You\nhave \n    n\n goods, the \n    i\n-th good costs \n    a_i\n coins. You got tired\nof remembering the price of each product when customers ask for it, thus you\ndecided to simplify your life. More precisely you decided to set the same\nprice for all \n    n\n goods you have. However, you don't want to lose any\nmoney so you want to choose the price in such a way that the sum of new prices\nis not less than the sum of the initial prices. It means that if you sell all\n\n    n\n goods for the new price, you will receive at least the same (or\ngreater) amount of money as if you sell them for their initial prices. On the\nother hand, you don't want to lose customers because of big prices so among\nall prices you can choose you need to choose the minimum one. So you need to\nfind the minimum possible equal price of all \n    n\n goods so if you sell them\nfor this price, you will receive at least the same (or greater) amount of\nmoney as if you sell them for their initial prices. You have to answer \n    q\n\nindependent queries. Input The first line of the input contains one integer\n\n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of queries. Then \n    q\n\nqueries follow. The first line of the query contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100)\n \u2014 the number of goods. The second line of the query\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    10^7\n), where \n    a_i\n is the price of the \n    i\n-th good. Output For each\nquery, print the answer for it \u2014 the minimum possible equal price of all\n\n    n\n goods so if you sell them for this price, you will receive at least\nthe same (or greater) amount of money as if you sell them for their initial\nprices. Example Input 3 5 1 2 3 4 5 3 1 2 2 4 1 1 1 1 Output 3 2 1\n\n",
