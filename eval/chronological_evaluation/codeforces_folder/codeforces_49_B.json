        "description": "Vasya studies positional numeral systems. Unfortunately, he often forgets to\nwrite the base of notation in which the expression is written. Once he saw a\nnote in his notebook saying a + b = ?, and that the base of the positional\nnotation wasn\u2019t written anywhere. Now Vasya has to choose a base p and regard\nthe expression as written in the base p positional notation. Vasya understood\nthat he can get different results with different bases, and some bases are\neven invalid. For example, expression 78 + 87 in the base 16 positional\nnotation is equal to FF16, in the base 15 positional notation it is equal to\n11015, in the base 10 one \u2014 to 16510, in the base 9 one \u2014 to 1769, and in the\nbase 8 or lesser-based positional notations the expression is invalid as all\nthe numbers should be strictly less than the positional notation base. Vasya\ngot interested in what is the length of the longest possible expression value.\nHelp him to find this length. The length of a number should be understood as\nthe number of numeric characters in it. For example, the length of the longest\nanswer for 78 + 87 = ? is 3. It is calculated like that in the base 15\n(11015), base 10 (16510), base 9 (1769) positional notations, for example, and\nin some other ones. Input The first letter contains two space-separated\nnumbers a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 1000) which represent the given summands. Output\nPrint a single number \u2014 the length of the longest answer. Examples Input 78 87\nOutput 3 Input 1 1 Output 2\n\n",
