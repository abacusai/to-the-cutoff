        "description": "There are \n    n\n children, who study at the school \u211641. It is well-known that\nthey are good mathematicians. Once at a break, they arranged a challenge for\nthemselves. All children arranged in a row and turned heads either to the left\nor to the right. Children can do the following: in one second several pairs of\nneighboring children who are looking at each other can simultaneously turn the\nhead in the opposite direction. For instance, the one who was looking at the\nright neighbor turns left and vice versa for the second child. Moreover, every\nsecond at least one pair of neighboring children performs such action. They\nare going to finish when there is no pair of neighboring children who are\nlooking at each other. You are given the number \n    n\n, the initial\narrangement of children and the number \n    k\n. You have to find a way for the\nchildren to act if they want to finish the process in exactly \n    k\n seconds.\nMore formally, for each of the \n    k\n moves, you need to output the numbers\nof the children who turn left during this move. For instance, for the\nconfiguration shown below and \n    k = 2\n children can do the following steps:\nAt the beginning, two pairs make move: \n    (1, 2)\n and \n    (3, 4)\n. After\nthat, we receive the following configuration: At the second move pair \n    (2,\n    3)\n makes the move. The final configuration is reached. Good job. It is\nguaranteed that if the solution exists, it takes not more than \n    n^2\n\n\"headturns\". Input The first line of input contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 3000000\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of children and required number of moves. The next line contains a\nstring of length \n    n\n and consists only of characters L and R, where L\nmeans that the child looks to the left and R means that the child looks to the\nright. Output If there is no solution, print a single line with number\n\n    -1\n. Otherwise, output \n    k\n lines. Each line has to start with a\nnumber \n    n_i\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n_i \n    \u2264\n    n/2\n) \u2014 the number of pairs\nof children, who turn at this move. After that print \n    n_i\n distinct\nintegers \u2014 the numbers of the children who will turn left during this move.\nAfter performing all \"headturns\", there can't be a pair of two neighboring\nchildren looking at each other. If there are many solutions, print any of\nthem. Examples Input 2 1 RL Output 1 1 Input 2 1 LR Output -1 Input 4 2 RLRL\nOutput 2 1 3 1 2 Note The first sample contains a pair of children who look at\neach other. After one move, they can finish the process. In the second sample,\nchildren can't make any move. As a result, they can't end in \n    k>0\n moves.\nThe third configuration is described in the statement.\n\n",
