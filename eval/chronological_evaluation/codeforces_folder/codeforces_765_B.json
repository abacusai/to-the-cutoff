        "description": "Kostya likes Codeforces contests very much. However, he is very disappointed\nthat his solutions are frequently hacked. That's why he decided to obfuscate\n(intentionally make less readable) his code before upcoming contest. To\nobfuscate the code, Kostya first looks at the first variable name used in his\nprogram and replaces all its occurrences with a single symbol a, then he looks\nat the second variable name that has not been replaced yet, and replaces all\nits occurrences with b, and so on. Kostya is well-mannered, so he doesn't use\nany one-letter names before obfuscation. Moreover, there are at most 26 unique\nidentifiers in his programs. You are given a list of identifiers of some\nprogram with removed spaces and line breaks. Check if this program can be a\nresult of Kostya's obfuscation. Input In the only line of input there is a\nstring S of lowercase English letters (1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 500) \u2014 the identifiers of a\nprogram with removed whitespace characters. Output If this program can be a\nresult of Kostya's obfuscation, print \"YES\" (without quotes), otherwise print\n\"NO\". Examples Input abacaba Output YES Input jinotega Output NO Note In the\nfirst sample case, one possible list of identifiers would be \"number string\nnumber character number string number\". Here how Kostya would obfuscate the\nprogram: replace all occurences of number with a, the result would be \"a\nstring a character a string a\", replace all occurences of string with b, the\nresult would be \"a b a character a b a\", replace all occurences of character\nwith c, the result would be \"a b a c a b a\", all identifiers have been\nreplaced, thus the obfuscation is finished.\n\n",
