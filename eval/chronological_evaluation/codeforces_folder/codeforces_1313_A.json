        "description": "Tired of boring office work, Denis decided to open a fast food restaurant. On\nthe first day he made \n    a\n portions of dumplings, \n    b\n portions of\ncranberry juice and \n    c\n pancakes with condensed milk. The peculiarity of\nDenis's restaurant is the procedure of ordering food. For each visitor Denis\nhimself chooses a set of dishes that this visitor will receive. When doing so,\nDenis is guided by the following rules: every visitor should receive at least\none dish (dumplings, cranberry juice, pancakes with condensed milk are all\nconsidered to be dishes); each visitor should receive no more than one portion\nof dumplings, no more than one portion of cranberry juice and no more than one\npancake with condensed milk; all visitors should receive different sets of\ndishes. What is the maximum number of visitors Denis can feed? Input The first\nline contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 500\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases to solve. Each of the remaining \n    t\n lines contains integers\n\n    a\n, \n    b\n and \n    c\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a, b, c \n    \u2264 10\n) \u2014 the number\nof portions of dumplings, the number of portions of cranberry juice and the\nnumber of condensed milk pancakes Denis made. Output For each test case print\na single integer \u2014 the maximum number of visitors Denis can feed. Example\nInput 7 1 2 1 0 0 0 9 1 7 2 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 2 4 4 4 Output 3 0 4 5 5 5 7 Note In\nthe first test case of the example, Denis can feed the first visitor with\ndumplings, give the second a portion of cranberry juice, and give the third\nvisitor a portion of cranberry juice and a pancake with a condensed milk. In\nthe second test case of the example, the restaurant Denis is not very\npromising: he can serve no customers. In the third test case of the example,\nDenise can serve four visitors. The first guest will receive a full lunch of\ndumplings, a portion of cranberry juice and a pancake with condensed milk. The\nsecond visitor will get only dumplings. The third guest will receive a pancake\nwith condensed milk, and the fourth guest will receive a pancake and a portion\nof dumplings. Please note that Denis hasn't used all of the prepared products,\nbut is unable to serve more visitors.\n\n",
