        "name": "Electric Scheme",
        "description": "Pasha is a young technician, nevertheless, he has already got a huge goal: to\nassemble a PC. The first task he has to become familiar with is to assemble an\nelectric scheme. The scheme Pasha assembled yesterday consists of several\nwires. Each wire is a segment that connects two points on a plane with integer\ncoordinates within the segment \n    [1, 10^9]\n. There are wires of two colors\nin the scheme: red wires: these wires are horizontal segments, i.e. if such a\nwire connects two points \n    (x_1, y_1)\n and \n    (x_2, y_2)\n, then \n    y_1 =\n    y_2\n; blue wires: these wires are vertical segments, i.e. if such a wire\nconnects two points \n    (x_1, y_1)\n and \n    (x_2, y_2)\n, then \n    x_1 =\n    x_2\n. Note that if a wire connects a point to itself, it may be blue, and it\ncan be red. Also, in Pasha's scheme no two wires of the same color intersect,\ni.e. there are no two wires of same color that have common points. The\nimperfection of Pasha's scheme was that the wires were not isolated, so in the\npoints where two wires of different colors intersect, Pasha saw sparks. Pasha\nwrote down all the points where he saw sparks and obtained a set of \n    n\n\ndistinct points. After that he disassembled the scheme. Next morning Pasha\nlooked at the set of \n    n\n points where he had seen sparks and wondered how\nmany wires had he used. Unfortunately, he does not remember that, so he\nwonders now what is the smallest number of wires he might have used in the\nscheme. Help him to determine this number and place the wires in such a way\nthat in the resulting scheme the sparks occur in the same places. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014\nthe number of points where Pasha saw sparks. Each of the next \n    n\n lines\ncontain two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014\nthe coordinates of a point with sparks. It is guaranteed that all points are\ndistinct. Output Print the description of the scheme in the following format.\nIn the first line print \n    h\n \u2014 the number of horizontal red wires (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 h\n). In each of the next \n    h\n lines print \n    4\n integers\n\n    x_1\n, \n    y_1\n, \n    x_2\n, \n    y_2\n \u2014 the coordinates of two points\n\n    (x_1, y_1)\n and \n    (x_2, y_2)\n that are connected with this red wire.\nThe segmenst must be horizontal, i.e. \n    y_1 = y_2\n must hold. Also, the\nconstraint \n    1 \n    \u2264 x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \n    \u2264 10^9\n must hold. After that\nprint \n    v\n \u2014 the number of vertical blue wires (\n    0 \n    \u2264 v\n). In each\nof the next \n    v\n lines print \n    4\n integers \n    x_1\n, \n    y_1\n,\n\n    x_2\n, \n    y_2\n \u2014 the coordinates of two points \n    (x_1, y_1)\n and\n\n    (x_2, y_2)\n that are connected with this blue wire. The segmenst must be\nvertical, i.e. \n    x_1 = x_2\n shomustuld hold. Also, the constraint \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \n    \u2264 10^9\n must hold. No two segments of the\nsame color should have common points. The set of points where sparks appear\nshould be the same as given in the input. The number of segments \n    (h + v)\n\nshould be minimum possible. It's easy to see that the answer always exists. If\nthere are multiple possible answers, print any. Examples Input 4 2 2 2 4 4 2 4\n4 Output 2 5 2 1 2 1 4 5 4 2 2 1 2 5 4 5 4 1 Input 4 2 1 3 2 2 3 1 2 Output 4\n2 1 2 1 3 2 3 2 1 2 1 2 2 3 2 3 3 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 2 2 3 2 1 Note In the first\nexample Pasha could have assembled the following scheme: In this scheme there\nare \n    2\n wires of each color: red ones connecting \n    (5, 2)\n with \n    (1,\n    2)\n and \n    (1, 4)\n with \n    (5, 4)\n, blue ones connecting \n    (2, 1)\n\nwith \n    (2, 5)\n and \n    (4, 5)\n with \n    (4, 1)\n. Note that the sparks\nappear in the points that are described in the input, they are shown in yellow\non the picture. For example, Pasha will see the spark in the point \n    (2,\n    4)\n because the second red wire and the first blue wire intersect there. It\nis possible to show that we can't have less than \n    4\n wires to produce a\nscheme with same sparks positions.\n\n",
