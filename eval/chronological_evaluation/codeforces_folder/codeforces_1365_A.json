        "description": "Ashish and Vivek play a game on a matrix consisting of \n    n\n rows and\n\n    m\n columns, where they take turns claiming cells. Unclaimed cells are\nrepresented by \n    0\n, while claimed cells are represented by \n    1\n. The\ninitial state of the matrix is given. There can be some claimed cells in the\ninitial state. In each turn, a player must claim a cell. A cell may be claimed\nif it is unclaimed and does not share a row or column with any other already\nclaimed cells. When a player is unable to make a move, he loses and the game\nends. If Ashish and Vivek take turns to move and Ashish goes first, determine\nthe winner of the game if both of them are playing optimally. Optimal play\nbetween two players means that both players choose the best possible strategy\nto achieve the best possible outcome for themselves. Input The first line\nconsists of a single integer \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 50)\n \u2014 the number\nof test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of\neach test case consists of two space-separated integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n \n    (1\n    \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 50)\n \u2014 the number of rows and columns in the matrix. The\nfollowing \n    n\n lines consist of \n    m\n integers each, the \n    j\n-th\ninteger on the \n    i\n-th line denoting \n    a_i,j\n \n    (a_i,j\n    \u2208\n    \n    0, 1\n    \n    )\n. Output For each test case if Ashish wins the game print\n\"Ashish\" otherwise print \"Vivek\" (without quotes). Example Input 4 2 2 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2 3 1 0 1 1 1 0 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 Output Vivek Ashish Vivek\nAshish Note For the first case: One possible scenario could be: Ashish claims\ncell \n    (1, 1)\n, Vivek then claims cell \n    (2, 2)\n. Ashish can neither\nclaim cell \n    (1, 2)\n, nor cell \n    (2, 1)\n as cells \n    (1, 1)\n and\n\n    (2, 2)\n are already claimed. Thus Ashish loses. It can be shown that no\nmatter what Ashish plays in this case, Vivek will win. For the second case:\nAshish claims cell \n    (1, 1)\n, the only cell that can be claimed in the\nfirst move. After that Vivek has no moves left. For the third case: Ashish\ncannot make a move, so Vivek wins. For the fourth case: If Ashish claims cell\n\n    (2, 3)\n, Vivek will have no moves left.\n\n",
