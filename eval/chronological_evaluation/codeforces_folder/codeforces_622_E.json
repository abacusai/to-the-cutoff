        "description": "Tree is a connected graph without cycles. A leaf of a tree is any vertex\nconnected with exactly one other vertex. You are given a tree with n vertices\nand a root in the vertex 1. There is an ant in each leaf of the tree. In one\nsecond some ants can simultaneously go to the parent vertex from the vertex\nthey were in. No two ants can be in the same vertex simultaneously except for\nthe root of the tree. Find the minimal time required for all ants to be in the\nroot of the tree. Note that at start the ants are only in the leaves of the\ntree. Input The first line contains integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 5\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of\nvertices in the tree. Each of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers xi,\nyi (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 n) \u2014 the ends of the i-th edge. It is guaranteed that you are\ngiven the correct undirected tree. Output Print the only integer t \u2014 the\nminimal time required for all ants to be in the root of the tree. Examples\nInput 12 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 5 2 6 3 7 3 8 3 9 8 10 8 11 8 12 Output 6 Input 2 2 1\nOutput 1\n\n",
