        "description": "Omkar is creating a mosaic using colored square tiles, which he places in an\n\n    n \n    \u00d7 n\n grid. When the mosaic is complete, each cell in the grid\nwill have either a glaucous or sinoper tile. However, currently he has only\nplaced tiles in some cells. A completed mosaic will be a mastapeece if and\nonly if each tile is adjacent to exactly \n    2\n tiles of the same color\n(\n    2\n tiles are adjacent if they share a side.) Omkar wants to fill the\nrest of the tiles so that the mosaic becomes a mastapeece. Now he is\nwondering, is the way to do this unique, and if it is, what is it? Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2000\n).\nThen follow \n    n\n lines with \n    n\n characters in each line. The \n    i\n-th\ncharacter in the \n    j\n-th line corresponds to the cell in row \n    i\n and\ncolumn \n    j\n of the grid, and will be \n    S\n if Omkar has placed a sinoper\ntile in this cell, \n    G\n if Omkar has placed a glaucous tile, \n    .\n if\nit's empty. Output On the first line, print UNIQUE if there is a unique way to\nget a mastapeece, NONE if Omkar cannot create any, and MULTIPLE if there is\nmore than one way to do so. All letters must be uppercase. If you print\nUNIQUE, then print \n    n\n additional lines with \n    n\n characters in each\nline, such that the \n    i\n-th character in the \n    j^\n    th\n line is\n\n    S\n if the tile in row \n    i\n and column \n    j\n of the mastapeece is\nsinoper, and \n    G\n if it is glaucous. Examples Input 4 S... ..G. .... ...S\nOutput MULTIPLE Input 6 S..... ....G. ..S... .....S ....G. G..... Output NONE\nInput 10 .S....S... .......... ...SSS.... .......... .......... ...GS.....\n....G...G. .......... ......G... .......... Output UNIQUE SSSSSSSSSS\nSGGGGGGGGS SGSSSSSSGS SGSGGGGSGS SGSGSSGSGS SGSGSSGSGS SGSGGGGSGS SGSSSSSSGS\nSGGGGGGGGS SSSSSSSSSS Input 1 . Output NONE Note For the first test case,\nOmkar can make the mastapeeces SSSS SGGS SGGS SSSS and SSGG SSGG GGSS GGSS.\nFor the second test case, it can be proven that it is impossible for Omkar to\nadd tiles to create a mastapeece. For the third case, it can be proven that\nthe given mastapeece is the only mastapeece Omkar can create by adding tiles.\nFor the fourth test case, it's clearly impossible for the only tile in any\nmosaic Omkar creates to be adjacent to two tiles of the same color, as it will\nbe adjacent to \n    0\n tiles total.\n\n",
