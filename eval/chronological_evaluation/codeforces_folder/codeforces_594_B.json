        "description": "For months Maxim has been coming to work on his favorite bicycle. And quite\nrecently he decided that he is ready to take part in a cyclists' competitions.\nHe knows that this year n competitions will take place. During the i-th\ncompetition the participant must as quickly as possible complete a ride along\na straight line from point si to point fi (si < fi). Measuring time is a\ncomplex process related to usage of a special sensor and a time counter. Think\nof the front wheel of a bicycle as a circle of radius r. Let's neglect the\nthickness of a tire, the size of the sensor, and all physical effects. The\nsensor is placed on the rim of the wheel, that is, on some fixed point on a\ncircle of radius r. After that the counter moves just like the chosen point of\nthe circle, i.e. moves forward and rotates around the center of the circle. At\nthe beginning each participant can choose any point bi, such that his bike is\nfully behind the starting line, that is, bi < si - r. After that, he starts\nthe movement, instantly accelerates to his maximum speed and at time tsi, when\nthe coordinate of the sensor is equal to the coordinate of the start, the time\ncounter starts. The cyclist makes a complete ride, moving with his maximum\nspeed and at the moment the sensor's coordinate is equal to the coordinate of\nthe finish (moment of time tfi), the time counter deactivates and records the\nfinal time. Thus, the counter records that the participant made a complete\nride in time tfi - tsi. Maxim is good at math and he suspects that the total\nresult doesn't only depend on his maximum speed v, but also on his choice of\nthe initial point bi. Now Maxim is asking you to calculate for each of n\ncompetitions the minimum possible time that can be measured by the time\ncounter. The radius of the wheel of his bike is equal to r. Input The first\nline contains three integers n, r and v (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 r, v \u2264 10^9) \u2014\nthe number of competitions, the radius of the front wheel of Max's bike and\nhis maximum speed, respectively. Next n lines contain the descriptions of the\ncontests. The i-th line contains two integers si and fi (1 \u2264 si < fi \u2264 10^9) \u2014\nthe coordinate of the start and the coordinate of the finish on the i-th\ncompetition. Output Print n real numbers, the i-th number should be equal to\nthe minimum possible time measured by the time counter. Your answer will be\nconsidered correct if its absolute or relative error will not exceed 10^-6.\nNamely: let's assume that your answer equals a, and the answer of the jury is\nb. The checker program will consider your answer correct if . Examples Input 2\n1 2 1 10 5 9 Output 3.849644710502 1.106060157705\n\n",
