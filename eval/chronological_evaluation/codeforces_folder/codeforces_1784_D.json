        "description": "\n    2^n\n people, numbered with distinct integers from \n    1\n to \n    2^n\n,\nare playing in a single elimination tournament. The bracket of the tournament\nis a full binary tree of height \n    n\n with \n    2^n\n leaves. When two\nplayers meet each other in a match, a player with the smaller number always\nwins. The winner of the tournament is the player who wins all \n    n\n their\nmatches. A virtual consolation prize \"Wooden Spoon\" is awarded to a player who\nsatisfies the following \n    n\n conditions: they lost their first match; the\nplayer who beat them lost their second match; the player who beat that player\nlost their third match; \n    \u2026\n; the player who beat the player from\nthe previous condition lost the final match of the tournament. It can be shown\nthat there is always exactly one player who satisfies these conditions.\nConsider all possible \n    (2^n)!\n arrangements of players into the tournament\nbracket. For each player, find the number of these arrangements in which they\nwill be awarded the \"Wooden Spoon\", and print these numbers modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Input The only line contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 20\n) \u2014 the size of the tournament. There are \n    20\n\ntests in the problem: in the first test, \n    n = 1\n; in the second test, \n    n\n    = 2\n; \n    \u2026\n; in the \n    20\n-th test, \n    n = 20\n. Output Print\n\n    2^n\n integers \u2014 the number of arrangements in which the \"Wooden Spoon\" is\nawarded to players \n    1, 2, \n    \u2026, 2^n\n, modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n.\nExamples Input 1 Output 0 2 Input 2 Output 0 0 8 16 Input 3 Output 0 0 0 1536\n4224 7680 11520 15360 Note In the first example, the \"Wooden Spoon\" is always\nawarded to player \n    2\n. In the second example, there are \n    8\n\narrangements where players \n    1\n and \n    4\n meet each other in the first\nmatch, and in these cases, the \"Wooden Spoon\" is awarded to player \n    3\n. In\nthe remaining \n    16\n arrangements, the \"Wooden Spoon\" is awarded to player\n\n    4\n.\n\n",
