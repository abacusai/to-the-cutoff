        "description": "What joy! Petya's parents went on a business trip for the whole year and the\nplayful kid is left all by himself. Petya got absolutely happy. He jumped on\nthe bed and threw pillows all day long, until... Today Petya opened the\ncupboard and found a scary note there. His parents had left him with duties:\nhe should water their favourite flower all year, each day, in the morning, in\nthe afternoon and in the evening. \"Wait a second!\" \u2014 thought Petya. He know\nfor a fact that if he fulfills the parents' task in the i-th (1 \u2264 i \u2264 12)\nmonth of the year, then the flower will grow by ai centimeters, and if he\ndoesn't water the flower in the i-th month, then the flower won't grow this\nmonth. Petya also knows that try as he might, his parents won't believe that\nhe has been watering the flower if it grows strictly less than by k\ncentimeters. Help Petya choose the minimum number of months when he will water\nthe flower, given that the flower should grow no less than by k centimeters.\nInput The first line contains exactly one integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 100). The next\nline contains twelve space-separated integers: the i-th (1 \u2264 i \u2264 12) number in\nthe line represents ai (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 100). Output Print the only integer \u2014 the\nminimum number of months when Petya has to water the flower so that the flower\ngrows no less than by k centimeters. If the flower can't grow by k centimeters\nin a year, print -1. Examples Input 5 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 2 2 1 1 1 Output 2 Input 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 3 0 Output 0 Input 11 1 1 4 1 1 5 1 1 4 1 1 1 Output 3\nNote Let's consider the first sample test. There it is enough to water the\nflower during the seventh and the ninth month. Then the flower grows by\nexactly five centimeters. In the second sample Petya's parents will believe\nhim even if the flower doesn't grow at all (k = 0). So, it is possible for\nPetya not to water the flower at all.\n\n",
