        "description": "Polycarpus just has been out of luck lately! As soon as he found a job in the\n\"Binary Cat\" cafe, the club got burgled. All ice-cream was stolen. On the\nburglary night Polycarpus kept a careful record of all club visitors. Each\ntime a visitor entered the club, Polycarpus put down character \"+\" in his\nnotes. Similarly, each time a visitor left the club, Polycarpus put character\n\"-\" in his notes. We know that all cases of going in and out happened\nconsecutively, that is, no two events happened at the same time. Polycarpus\ndoesn't remember whether there was somebody in the club at the moment when his\nshift begun and at the moment when it ended. Right now the police wonders what\nminimum number of distinct people Polycarpus could have seen. Assume that he\nsees anybody coming in or out of the club. Each person could have come in or\nout an arbitrary number of times. Input The only line of the input contains a\nsequence of characters \"+\" and \"-\", the characters are written one after\nanother without any separators. The characters are written in the order, in\nwhich the corresponding events occurred. The given sequence has length from 1\nto 300 characters, inclusive. Output Print the sought minimum number of people\nExamples Input +-+-+ Output 1 Input \u00ad\u2013 Output 3\n\n",
