        "description": "There is a strip with an infinite number of cells. Cells are numbered starting\nwith \n    0\n. Initially the cell \n    i\n contains a ball with the number\n\n    i\n. There are \n    n\n pockets located at cells \n    a_1, \n    \u2026, a_n\n.\nEach cell contains at most one pocket. Filtering is the following sequence of\noperations: All pockets at cells \n    a_1, \n    \u2026, a_n\n open simultaneously,\nwhich makes balls currently located at those cells disappear. After the balls\ndisappear, the pockets close again. For each cell \n    i\n from \n    0\n to\n\n    \u221e\n, if the cell \n    i\n contains a ball, we move that ball to the\nfree cell \n    j\n with the lowest number. If there is no free cell \n    j <\n    i\n, the ball stays at the cell \n    i\n.Note that after each filtering\noperation each cell will still contain exactly one ball. For example, let the\ncells \n    1\n, \n    3\n and \n    4\n contain pockets. The initial configuration\nof balls is shown below (underscores display the cells with pockets): 0 1 2 3\n4 5 6 7 8 9 ... After opening and closing the pockets, balls 1, 3 and 4\ndisappear: 0 2 5 6 7 8 9 ... After moving all the balls to the left, the\nconfiguration looks like this: 0 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ... Another filtering\nrepetition results in the following: 0 5 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ... You have to\nanswer \n    m\n questions. The \n    i\n-th of these questions is \"what is the\nnumber of the ball located at the cell \n    x_i\n after \n    k_i\n repetitions\nof the filtering operation?\" Input The first line contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    m\n \u2014 the number of pockets and questions respectively (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The following line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1, \n    \u2026, a_n\n \u2014 the numbers of cells containing pockets (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 a_1 < \n    \u2026 < a_n \n    \u2264 10^9\n). The following \n    m\n lines\ndescribe questions. The \n    i\n-th of these lines contains two integers\n\n    x_i\n and \n    k_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x_i, k_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Output Print\n\n    m\n numbers \u2014 answers to the questions, in the same order as given in the\ninput. Example Input 3 15 1 3 4 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 0 2 1\n2 2 2 3 2 4 2 Output 0 1 2 3 4 0 2 5 6 7 0 5 8 9 10\n\n",
