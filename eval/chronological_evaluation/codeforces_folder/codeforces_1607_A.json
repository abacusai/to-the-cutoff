        "description": "You are given a keyboard that consists of \n    26\n keys. The keys are arranged\nsequentially in one row in a certain order. Each key corresponds to a unique\nlowercase Latin letter. You have to type the word \n    s\n on this keyboard. It\nalso consists only of lowercase Latin letters. To type a word, you need to\ntype all its letters consecutively one by one. To type each letter you must\nposition your hand exactly over the corresponding key and press it. Moving the\nhand between the keys takes time which is equal to the absolute value of the\ndifference between positions of these keys (the keys are numbered from left to\nright). No time is spent on pressing the keys and on placing your hand over\nthe first letter of the word. For example, consider a keyboard where the\nletters from 'a' to 'z' are arranged in consecutive alphabetical order. The\nletters 'h', 'e', 'l' and 'o' then are on the positions \n    8\n, \n    5\n,\n\n    12\n and \n    15\n, respectively. Therefore, it will take \n    |5 - 8| + |12\n    - 5| + |12 - 12| + |15 - 12| = 13\n units of time to type the word \"hello\".\nDetermine how long it will take to print the word \n    s\n. Input The first\nline contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases. The next \n    2t\n lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\nThe first line of a description contains a keyboard \u2014 a string of length\n\n    26\n, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters. Each of the letters\nfrom 'a' to 'z' appears exactly once on the keyboard. The second line of the\ndescription contains the word \n    s\n. The word has a length from \n    1\n to\n\n    50\n letters inclusive and consists of lowercase Latin letters. Output\nPrint \n    t\n lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test\ncase. The answer to the test case is the minimal time it takes to type the\nword \n    s\n on the given keyboard. Example Input 5 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\nhello abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz i abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz codeforces\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq\nqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm abacaba Output 13 0 68 0 74\n\n",
