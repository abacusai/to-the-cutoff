        "name": "Triangles on a Rectangle",
        "description": "A rectangle with its opposite corners in \n    (0, 0)\n and \n    (w, h)\n and\nsides parallel to the axes is drawn on a plane. You are given a list of\nlattice points such that each point lies on a side of a rectangle but not in\nits corner. Also, there are at least two points on every side of a rectangle.\nYour task is to choose three points in such a way that: exactly two of them\nbelong to the same side of a rectangle; the area of a triangle formed by them\nis maximum possible. Print the doubled area of this triangle. It can be shown\nthat the doubled area of any triangle formed by lattice points is always an\ninteger. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. The first line of each testcase\ncontains two integers \n    w\n and \n    h\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 w, h \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014\nthe coordinates of the corner of a rectangle. The next two lines contain the\ndescription of the points on two horizontal sides. First, an integer \n    k\n\n(\n    2 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of points. Then, \n    k\n\nintegers \n    x_1 < x_2 < \n    \u2026 < x_k\n (\n    0 < x_i < w\n) \u2014 the \n    x\n\ncoordinates of the points in the ascending order. The \n    y\n coordinate for\nthe first line is \n    0\n and for the second line is \n    h\n. The next two\nlines contain the description of the points on two vertical sides. First, an\ninteger \n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of points.\nThen, \n    k\n integers \n    y_1 < y_2 < \n    \u2026 < y_k\n (\n    0 < y_i < h\n) \u2014\nthe \n    y\n coordinates of the points in the ascending order. The \n    x\n\ncoordinate for the first line is \n    0\n and for the second line is \n    w\n.\nThe total number of points on all sides in all testcases doesn't exceed \n    2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each testcase print a single integer \u2014 the doubled\nmaximum area of a triangle formed by such three points that exactly two of\nthem belong to the same side.
