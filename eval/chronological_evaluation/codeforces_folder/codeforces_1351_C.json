        "description": "Skier rides on a snowy field. Its movements can be described by a string of\ncharacters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E' (which correspond to \n    1\n meter movement in\nthe south, north, west or east direction respectively). It is known that if he\nmoves along a previously unvisited segment of a path (i.e. this segment of the\npath is visited the first time), then the time of such movement is \n    5\n\nseconds. If he rolls along previously visited segment of a path (i.e., this\nsegment of the path has been covered by his path before), then it takes\n\n    1\n second. Find the skier's time to roll all the path. Input The first\nline contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases in the input. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. Each set is given by\none nonempty string of the characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E'. The length of the\nstring does not exceed \n    10^5\n characters. The sum of the lengths of\n\n    t\n given lines over all test cases in the input does not exceed\n\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print the desired path time in seconds.\nExample Input 5 NNN NS WWEN WWEE NWNWS Output 15 6 16 12 25\n\n",
