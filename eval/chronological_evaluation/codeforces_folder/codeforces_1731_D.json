        "description": "Game studio \"DbZ Games\" wants to introduce another map in their popular game\n\"Valiant\". This time, the map named \"Panvel\" will be based on the city of\nMumbai. Mumbai can be represented as \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n cellular grid. Each\ncell \n    (i, j)\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 j \n    \u2264 m\n) of the\ngrid is occupied by a cuboid building of height \n    a_i,j\n. This time, DbZ\nGames want to make a map that has perfect vertical gameplay. That's why they\nwant to choose an \n    l \n    \u00d7 l\n square inside Mumbai, such that each\nbuilding inside the square has a height of at least \n    l\n. Can you help DbZ\nGames find such a square of the maximum possible size \n    l\n? Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n). Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two positive integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 m\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u00b7 m \n    \u2264 10^6\n). The\n\n    i\n-th of next \n    n\n lines contains \n    m\n integers \n    a_i,1,\n    a_i,2, \n    \u2026, a_i,m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i,j\n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 heights of\nbuildings on the \n    i\n-th row. It's guaranteed that the sum of \n    n \n    \u00b7\n    m\n over all test cases doesn't exceed \n    10^6\n. Output For each test case,\nprint the maximum side length \n    l\n of the square DbZ Games can choose.\nExample Input 4 2 2 2 3 4 5 1 3 1 2 3 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 4 5 6 1 9 4 6 5 8 10 9 5 8\n11 6 24 42 32 8 11 1 23 1 9 69 13 3 13 22 60 12 14 17 Output 2 1 1 3 Note In\nthe first test case, we can choose the square of side \n    l = 2\n (i. e. the\nwhole grid) since the heights of all buildings are greater than or equal to\n\n    2\n. In the second test case, we can only choose the side as \n    1\n, so\nthe answer is \n    1\n. In the third test case, there are no squares of size\n\n    2\n that have all buildings of height at least \n    2\n, so the answer is\n\n    1\n.\n\n",
