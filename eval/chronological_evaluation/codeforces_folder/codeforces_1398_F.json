        "description": "Alice and Bob play a game. The game consists of several sets, and each set\nconsists of several rounds. Each round is won either by Alice or by Bob, and\nthe set ends when one of the players has won \n    x\n rounds in a row. For\nexample, if Bob won five rounds in a row and \n    x = 2\n, then two sets ends.\nYou know that Alice and Bob have already played \n    n\n rounds, and you know\nthe results of some rounds. For each \n    x\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n,\ncalculate the maximum possible number of sets that could have already finished\nif each set lasts until one of the players wins \n    x\n rounds in a row. It is\npossible that the last set is still not finished \u2014 in that case, you should\nnot count it in the answer. Input The first line contains one integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number of rounds. The second line contains\none string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n \u2014 the descriptions of rounds. If the\n\n    i\n-th element of the string is 0, then Alice won the \n    i\n-th round; if\nit is 1, then Bob won the \n    i\n-th round, and if it is ?, then you don't\nknow who won the \n    i\n-th round. Output In the only line print \n    n\n\nintegers. The \n    i\n-th integer should be equal to the maximum possible\nnumber of sets that could have already finished if each set lasts until one of\nthe players wins \n    i\n rounds in a row. Examples Input 6 11?000 Output 6 3 2\n1 0 0 Input 5 01?01 Output 5 1 0 0 0 Input 12 ???1??????1? Output 12 6 4 3 2 2\n1 1 1 1 1 1 Note Let's consider the first test case: if \n    x = 1\n and \n    s =\n    110000\n or \n    s = 111000\n then there are six finished sets; if \n    x = 2\n\nand \n    s = 110000\n then there are three finished sets; if \n    x = 3\n and\n\n    s = 111000\n then there are two finished sets; if \n    x = 4\n and \n    s =\n    110000\n then there is one finished set; if \n    x = 5\n then there are no\nfinished sets; if \n    x = 6\n then there are no finished sets.\n\n",
