        "description": "Alice and Bob have a tree (undirected acyclic connected graph). There are ai\nchocolates waiting to be picked up in the i-th vertex of the tree. First, they\nchoose two different vertices as their starting positions (Alice chooses\nfirst) and take all the chocolates contained in them. Then, they alternate\ntheir moves, selecting one vertex at a time and collecting all chocolates from\nthis node. To make things more interesting, they decided that one can select a\nvertex only if he/she selected a vertex adjacent to that one at his/her\nprevious turn and this vertex has not been already chosen by any of them\nduring other move. If at any moment one of them is not able to select the node\nthat satisfy all the rules, he/she will skip his turns and let the other\nperson pick chocolates as long as he/she can. This goes on until both of them\ncannot pick chocolates any further. Due to their greed for chocolates, they\nwant to collect as many chocolates as possible. However, as they are friends\nthey only care about the total number of chocolates they obtain together. What\nis the maximum total number of chocolates they may pick? Input The first line\nof the input contains the single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of\nvertices in the tree. The second line contains n integers ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9),\ni-th of these numbers stands for the number of chocolates stored at the node\ni. Then follow n - 1 lines that describe the tree. Each of them contains two\nintegers ui and vi (1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264 n) \u2014 indices of vertices connected by the\ni-th edge. Output Print the number of chocolates Alice and Bob can collect\ntogether if they behave optimally. Examples Input 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 1 3\n1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 Output 25 Input 2 20 10 1 2 Output 30 Note In the\nfirst sample, Alice may start at the vertex 9 and Bob at vertex 8. Alice will\nselect vertex 1 and Bob has no options now. Alice selects the vertex 7 and\nthey both stop. In the second sample, both of them will pick either of the\nnodes alternately.\n\n",
