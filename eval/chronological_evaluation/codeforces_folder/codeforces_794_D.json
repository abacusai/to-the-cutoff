        "name": "Labelling Cities",
        "description": "Oleg the bank client lives in Bankopolia. There are n cities in Bankopolia and\nsome pair of cities are connected directly by bi-directional roads. The cities\nare numbered from 1 to n. There are a total of m roads in Bankopolia, the i-th\nroad connects cities ui and vi. It is guaranteed that from each city it is\npossible to travel to any other city using some of the roads. Oleg wants to\ngive a label to each city. Suppose the label of city i is equal to xi. Then,\nit must hold that for all pairs of cities (u, v) the condition |xu - xv| \u2264 1\nholds if and only if there is a road connecting u and v. Oleg wonders if such\na labeling is possible. Find an example of such labeling if the task is\npossible and state that it is impossible otherwise. Input The first line of\ninput contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264\n3\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of cities and the number of roads. Next, m lines follow.\nThe i-th line contains two space-separated integers ui and vi (1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264 n,\nui \u2260 vi) \u2014 the cities connected by the i-th road. It is guaranteed that there\nis at most one road between each pair of cities and it is possible to travel\nfrom any city to any other city using some roads. Output If the required\nlabeling is not possible, output a single line containing the string \"NO\"\n(without quotes). Otherwise, output the string \"YES\" (without quotes) on the\nfirst line. On the next line, output n space-separated integers, x1, x2, ...,\nxn. The condition 1 \u2264 xi \u2264 10^9 must hold for all i, and for all pairs of\ncities (u, v) the condition |xu - xv| \u2264 1 must hold if and only if there is a\nroad connecting u and v. Examples Input 4 4 1 2 1 3 1 4 3 4 Output YES 2 3 1 1\nInput 5 10 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 2 3 2 4 2 5 3 4 3 5 5 4 Output YES 1 1 1 1 1 Input\n4 3 1 2 1 3 1 4 Output NO Note For the first sample, x1 = 2, x2 = 3, x3 = x4 =\n1 is a valid labeling. Indeed, (3, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4) are the only\npairs of cities with difference of labels not greater than 1, and these are\nprecisely the roads of Bankopolia. For the second sample, all pairs of cities\nhave difference of labels not greater than 1 and all pairs of cities have a\nroad connecting them. For the last sample, it is impossible to construct a\nlabeling satisfying the given constraints.\n\n",
