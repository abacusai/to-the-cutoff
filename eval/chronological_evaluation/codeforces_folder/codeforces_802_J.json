        "description": "Heidi's friend Jenny is asking Heidi to deliver an important letter to one of\ntheir common friends. Since Jenny is Irish, Heidi thinks that this might be a\nprank. More precisely, she suspects that the message she is asked to deliver\nstates: \"Send the fool further!\", and upon reading it the recipient will ask\nHeidi to deliver the same message to yet another friend (that the recipient\nhas in common with Heidi), and so on. Heidi believes that her friends want to\navoid awkward situations, so she will not be made to visit the same person\n(including Jenny) twice. She also knows how much it costs to travel between\nany two of her friends who know each other. She wants to know: what is the\nmaximal amount of money she will waste on travel if it really is a prank?\nHeidi's n friends are labeled 0 through n - 1, and their network of\nconnections forms a tree. In other words, every two of her friends a, b know\neach other, possibly indirectly (there is a sequence of friends starting from\na and ending on b and such that each two consecutive friends in the sequence\nknow each other directly), and there are exactly n - 1 pairs of friends who\nknow each other directly. Jenny is given the number 0. Input The first line of\nthe input contains the number of friends n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100). The next n - 1 lines\neach contain three space-separated integers u, v and c (0 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n - 1, 1 \u2264\nc \u2264 10^4), meaning that u and v are friends (know each other directly) and the\ncost for travelling between u and v is c. It is guaranteed that the social\nnetwork of the input forms a tree. Output Output a single integer \u2013 the\nmaximum sum of costs. Examples Input 4 0 1 4 0 2 2 2 3 3 Output 5 Input 6 1 2\n3 0 2 100 1 4 2 0 3 7 3 5 10 Output 105 Input 11 1 0 1664 2 0 881 3 2 4670 4 2\n1555 5 1 1870 6 2 1265 7 2 288 8 7 2266 9 2 1536 10 6 3378 Output 5551 Note In\nthe second example, the worst-case scenario goes like this: Jenny sends Heidi\nto the friend labeled by number 2 (incurring a cost of 100), then friend 2\nsends her to friend 1 (costing Heidi 3), and finally friend 1 relays her to\nfriend 4 (incurring an additional cost of 2).\n\n",
