        "description": "You and your friend Ilya are participating in an individual programming\ncontest consisting of multiple stages. A contestant can get between \n    0\n\nand \n    100\n points, inclusive, for each stage, independently of other\ncontestants. Points received by contestants in different stages are used for\nforming overall contest results. Suppose that \n    k\n stages of the contest\nare completed. For each contestant, \n    k - \n    \u230a\n    k/4\n    \u230b\n stages with the highest scores are selected, and these scores are\nadded up. This sum is the overall result of the contestant. (Here \n    \u230a\n    t \n    \u230b\n denotes rounding \n    t\n down.) For example, suppose \n    9\n\nstages are completed, and your scores are \n    50, 30, 50, 50, 100, 10, 30, 100,\n    50\n. First, \n    7\n stages with the highest scores are chosen \u2014 for example,\nall stages except for the \n    2\n-nd and the \n    6\n-th can be chosen. Then\nyour overall result is equal to \n    50 + 50 + 50 + 100 + 30 + 100 + 50 =\n    430\n. As of now, \n    n\n stages are completed, and you know the points you\nand Ilya got for these stages. However, it is unknown how many more stages\nwill be held. You wonder what the smallest number of additional stages is,\nafter which your result might become greater than or equal to Ilya's result,\nat least in theory. Find this number! Input Each test contains multiple test\ncases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 1000\n). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each\ntest case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of completed stages. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 your points for the\ncompleted stages. The third line contains \n    n\n integers \n    b_1, b_2,\n    \n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 Ilya's points for the\ncompleted stages. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case print a single integer \u2014\nthe smallest number of additional stages required for your result to be able\nto become greater than or equal to Ilya's result. If your result is already\nnot less than Ilya's result, print \n    0\n. Example Input 5 1 100 0 1 0 100 4\n20 30 40 50 100 100 100 100 4 10 20 30 40 100 100 100 100 7 7 59 62 52 27 31\n55 33 35 50 98 83 80 64 Output 0 1 3 4 2 Note In the first test case, you have\nscored \n    100\n points for the first stage, while Ilya has scored \n    0\n.\nThus, your overall result (\n    100\n) is already not less than Ilya's result\n(\n    0\n). In the second test case, you have scored \n    0\n points for the\nfirst stage, while Ilya has scored \n    100\n. A single stage with an opposite\nresult is enough for both your and Ilya's overall scores to become equal to\n\n    100\n. In the third test case, your overall result is \n    30 + 40 + 50 =\n    120\n, while Ilya's result is \n    100 + 100 + 100 = 300\n. After three\nadditional stages your result might become equal to \n    420\n, while Ilya's\nresult might become equal to \n    400\n. In the fourth test case, your overall\nresult after four additional stages might become equal to \n    470\n, while\nIlya's result might become equal to \n    400\n. Three stages are not enough.\n\n",
