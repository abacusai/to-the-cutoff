        "description": "Tattah is asleep if and only if Tattah is attending a lecture. This is a well-\nknown formula among Tattah's colleagues. On a Wednesday afternoon, Tattah was\nattending Professor HH's lecture. At 12:21, right before falling asleep, he\nwas staring at the digital watch around Saher's wrist. He noticed that the\ndigits on the clock were the same when read from both directions i.e. a\npalindrome. In his sleep, he started dreaming about such rare moments of the\nday when the time displayed on a digital clock is a palindrome. As soon as he\nwoke up, he felt destined to write a program that finds the next such moment.\nHowever, he still hasn't mastered the skill of programming while sleeping, so\nyour task is to help him. Input The first and only line of the input starts\nwith a string with the format \"HH:MM\" where \"HH\" is from \"00\" to \"23\" and \"MM\"\nis from \"00\" to \"59\". Both \"HH\" and \"MM\" have exactly two digits. Output Print\nthe palindromic time of day that comes soonest after the time given in the\ninput. If the input time is palindromic, output the soonest palindromic time\nafter the input time. Examples Input 12:21 Output 13:31 Input 23:59 Output\n00:00\n\n",
