        "description": "Tired of boring dates, Leha and Noora decided to play a game. Leha found a\ntree with n vertices numbered from 1 to n. We remind you that tree is an\nundirected graph without cycles. Each vertex v of a tree has a number av\nwritten on it. Quite by accident it turned out that all values written on\nvertices are distinct and are natural numbers between 1 and n. The game goes\nin the following way. Noora chooses some vertex u of a tree uniformly at\nrandom and passes a move to Leha. Leha, in his turn, chooses (also uniformly\nat random) some vertex v from remaining vertices of a tree (v \u2260 u). As you\ncould guess there are n(n - 1) variants of choosing vertices by players. After\nthat players calculate the value of a function f(u, v) = \u03c6(au\u00b7av) \u00b7 d(u, v) of\nthe chosen vertices where \u03c6(x) is Euler's totient function and d(x, y) is the\nshortest distance between vertices x and y in a tree. Soon the game became\nboring for Noora, so Leha decided to defuse the situation and calculate\nexpected value of function f over all variants of choosing vertices u and v,\nhoping of at least somehow surprise the girl. Leha asks for your help in\ncalculating this expected value. Let this value be representable in the form\nof an irreducible fraction . To further surprise Noora, he wants to name her\nthe value . Help Leha! Input The first line of input contains one integer\nnumber n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 number of vertices in a tree. The second line\ncontains n different numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 n) separated by spaces,\ndenoting the values written on a tree vertices. Each of the next n - 1 lines\ncontains two integer numbers x and y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n), describing the next edge\nof a tree. It is guaranteed that this set of edges describes a tree. Output In\na single line print a number equal to P\u00b7Q^-1 modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input 3\n1 2 3 1 2 2 3 Output 333333338 Input 5 5 4 3 1 2 3 5 1 2 4 3 2 5 Output 8 Note\nEuler's totient function \u03c6(n) is the number of such i that 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,and\ngcd(i, n) = 1, where gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of numbers x and\ny. There are 6 variants of choosing vertices by Leha and Noora in the first\ntestcase: u = 1, v = 2, f(1, 2) = \u03c6(a1\u00b7a2)\u00b7d(1, 2) = \u03c6(1\u00b72)\u00b71 = \u03c6(2) = 1 u =\n2, v = 1, f(2, 1) = f(1, 2) = 1 u = 1, v = 3, f(1, 3) = \u03c6(a1\u00b7a3)\u00b7d(1, 3) =\n\u03c6(1\u00b73)\u00b72 = 2\u03c6(3) = 4 u = 3, v = 1, f(3, 1) = f(1, 3) = 4 u = 2, v = 3, f(2, 3)\n= \u03c6(a2\u00b7a3)\u00b7d(2, 3) = \u03c6(2\u00b73)\u00b71 = \u03c6(6) = 2 u = 3, v = 2, f(3, 2) = f(2, 3) = 2\nExpected value equals to . The value Leha wants to name Noora is 7\u00b73^-1 =\n7\u00b7333333336 = 333333338 . In the second testcase expected value equals to , so\nLeha will have to surprise Hoora by number 8\u00b71^-1 = 8 .\n\n",
