        "description": "Vasya and Petya are playing an online game. As most online games, it has hero\nprogress system that allows players to gain experience that make their heroes\nstronger. Of course, Vasya would like to get as many experience points as\npossible. After careful study of experience points allocation, he found out\nthat if he plays the game alone, he gets one experience point each second.\nHowever, if two players are playing together, and their current experience\nvalues differ by at most C points, they can boost their progress, and each of\nthem gets 2 experience points each second. Since Vasya and Petya are middle\nschool students, their parents don't allow them to play all the day around.\nEach of the friends has his own schedule: Vasya can only play during intervals\n[a1;b1], [a2;b2], ..., [an;bn], and Petya can only play during intervals\n[c1;d1], [c2;d2], ..., [cm;dm]. All time periods are given in seconds from the\ncurrent moment. Vasya is good in math, so he has noticed that sometimes it can\nbe profitable not to play alone, because experience difference could become\ntoo big, and progress would not be boosted even when played together. Now they\nwould like to create such schedule of playing that Vasya's final experience\nwas greatest possible. The current players experience is the same. Petya is\nnot so concerned about his experience, so he is ready to cooperate and play\nwhen needed to maximize Vasya's experience. Input The first line of input data\ncontains integers n, m and C \u2014 the number of intervals when Vasya can play,\nthe number of intervals when Petya can play, and the maximal difference in\nexperience level when playing together still gives a progress boost (1 \u2264 n, m\n\u2264 2\u00b710^5, 0 \u2264 C \u2264 10^18). The following n lines contain two integers each: ai,\nbi \u2014 intervals when Vasya can play (0 \u2264 ai < bi \u2264 10^18, bi < ai + 1). The\nfollowing m lines contain two integers each: ci, di \u2014 intervals when Petya can\nplay (0 \u2264 ci < di \u2264 10^18, di < ci + 1). Output Output one integer \u2014 the\nmaximal experience that Vasya can have in the end, if both players try to\nmaximize this value. Examples Input 2 1 5 1 7 10 20 10 20 Output 25 Input 1 2\n5 0 100 20 60 85 90 Output 125\n\n",
