        "description": "There are n boys and m girls studying in the class. They should stand in a\nline so that boys and girls alternated there as much as possible. Let's assume\nthat positions in the line are indexed from left to right by numbers from 1 to\nn + m. Then the number of integers i (1 \u2264 i < n + m) such that positions with\nindexes i and i + 1 contain children of different genders (position i has a\ngirl and position i + 1 has a boy or vice versa) must be as large as possible.\nHelp the children and tell them how to form the line. Input The single line of\nthe input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100), separated by a\nspace. Output Print a line of n + m characters. Print on the i-th position of\nthe line character \"B\", if the i-th position of your arrangement should have a\nboy and \"G\", if it should have a girl. Of course, the number of characters \"B\"\nshould equal n and the number of characters \"G\" should equal m. If there are\nmultiple optimal solutions, print any of them. Examples Input 3 3 Output\nGBGBGB Input 4 2 Output BGBGBB Note In the first sample another possible\nanswer is BGBGBG. In the second sample answer BBGBGB is also optimal.\n\n",
