        "description": "Polycarp was presented with some sequence of integers \n    a\n of length\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n). A sequence can make Polycarp happy only\nif it consists of different numbers (i.e. distinct numbers). In order to make\nhis sequence like this, Polycarp is going to make some (possibly zero) number\nof moves. In one move, he can: remove the first (leftmost) element of the\nsequence. For example, in one move, the sequence \n    [3, 1, 4, 3]\n will\nproduce the sequence \n    [1, 4, 3]\n, which consists of different numbers.\nDetermine the minimum number of moves he needs to make so that in the\nremaining sequence all elements are different. In other words, find the length\nof the smallest prefix of the given sequence \n    a\n, after removing which all\nvalues in the sequence will be unique. Input The first line of the input\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the\ngiven sequence \n    a\n. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 elements of the given sequence\n\n    a\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n values over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case print your\nanswer on a separate line \u2014 the minimum number of elements that must be\nremoved from the beginning of the sequence so that all remaining elements are\ndifferent. Example Input 5 4 3 1 4 3 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 6 5 4 3 2 1 7 1 2 1 7 1\n2 1 Output 1 4 0 0 5 Note The following are the sequences that will remain\nafter the removal of prefixes: \n    [1, 4, 3]\n; \n    [1]\n; \n    [1]\n; \n    [6,\n    5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n; \n    [2, 1]\n. It is easy to see that all the remaining\nsequences contain only distinct elements. In each test case, the shortest\nmatching prefix was removed.\n\n",
