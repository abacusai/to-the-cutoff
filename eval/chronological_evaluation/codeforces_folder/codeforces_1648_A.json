        "description": "Egor has a table of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n, with lines numbered from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n and columns numbered from \n    1\n to \n    m\n. Each cell has a color\nthat can be presented as an integer from \n    1\n to \n    10^5\n. Let us denote\nthe cell that lies in the intersection of the \n    r\n-th row and the\n\n    c\n-th column as \n    (r, c)\n. We define the manhattan distance between\ntwo cells \n    (r_1, c_1)\n and \n    (r_2, c_2)\n as the length of a shortest\npath between them where each consecutive cells in the path must have a common\nside. The path can go through cells of any color. For example, in the table\n\n    3 \n    \u00d7 4\n the manhattan distance between \n    (1, 2)\n and \n    (3,\n    3)\n is \n    3\n, one of the shortest paths is the following: \n    (1, 2) \n    \u2192\n    (2, 2) \n    \u2192 (2, 3) \n    \u2192 (3, 3)\n. Egor decided to calculate the sum of\nmanhattan distances between each pair of cells of the same color. Help him to\ncalculate this sum. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 m\n, \n    n \n    \u00b7 m \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) \u2014\nnumber of rows and columns in the table. Each of next \n    n\n lines describes\na row of the table. The \n    i\n-th line contains \n    m\n integers \n    c_i1,\n    c_i2, \n    \u2026, c_im\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_ij\n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) \u2014 colors\nof cells in the \n    i\n-th row. Output Print one integer \u2014 the the sum of\nmanhattan distances between each pair of cells of the same color. Examples\nInput 2 3 1 2 3 3 2 1 Output 7 Input 3 4 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 Output 76\nInput 4 4 1 1 2 3 2 1 1 2 3 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 Output 129 Note In the first sample\nthere are three pairs of cells of same color: in cells \n    (1, 1)\n and \n    (2,\n    3)\n, in cells \n    (1, 2)\n and \n    (2, 2)\n, in cells \n    (1, 3)\n and\n\n    (2, 1)\n. The manhattan distances between them are \n    3\n, \n    1\n and\n\n    3\n, the sum is \n    7\n.\n\n",
