        "description": "Once when Gerald studied in the first year at school, his teacher gave the\nclass the following homework. She offered the students a string consisting of\nn small Latin letters; the task was to learn the way the letters that the\nstring contains are written. However, as Gerald is too lazy, he has no desire\nwhatsoever to learn those letters. That's why he decided to lose some part of\nthe string (not necessarily a connected part). The lost part can consist of\nany number of segments of any length, at any distance from each other.\nHowever, Gerald knows that if he loses more than k characters, it will be very\nsuspicious. Find the least number of distinct characters that can remain in\nthe string after no more than k characters are deleted. You also have to find\nany possible way to delete the characters. Input The first input data line\ncontains a string whose length is equal to n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The string\nconsists of lowercase Latin letters. The second line contains the number k (0\n\u2264 k \u2264 10^5). Output Print on the first line the only number m \u2014 the least\npossible number of different characters that could remain in the given string\nafter it loses no more than k characters. Print on the second line the string\nthat Gerald can get after some characters are lost. The string should have\nexactly m distinct characters. The final string should be the subsequence of\nthe initial string. If Gerald can get several different strings with exactly m\ndistinct characters, print any of them. Examples Input aaaaa 4 Output 1 aaaaa\nInput abacaba 4 Output 1 aaaa Input abcdefgh 10 Output 0 Note In the first\nsample the string consists of five identical letters but you are only allowed\nto delete 4 of them so that there was at least one letter left. Thus, the\nright answer is 1 and any string consisting of characters \"a\" from 1 to 5 in\nlength. In the second sample you are allowed to delete 4 characters. You\ncannot delete all the characters, because the string has length equal to 7.\nHowever, you can delete all characters apart from \"a\" (as they are no more\nthan four), which will result in the \"aaaa\" string. In the third sample you\nare given a line whose length is equal to 8, and k = 10, so that the whole\nline can be deleted. The correct answer is 0 and an empty string.\n\n",
