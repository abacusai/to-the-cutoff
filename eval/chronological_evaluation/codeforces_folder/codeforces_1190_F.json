        "description": "Tokitsukaze is playing a room escape game designed by SkywalkerT. In this\ngame, she needs to find out hidden clues in the room to reveal a way to\nescape. After a while, she realizes that the only way to run away is to open\nthe digital door lock since she accidentally went into a secret compartment\nand found some clues, which can be interpreted as: Only when you enter \n    n\n\npossible different passwords can you open the door; Passwords must be integers\nranged from \n    0\n to \n    (m - 1)\n; A password cannot be \n    x\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 x < m\n) if \n    x\n and \n    m\n are not coprime (i.e. \n    x\n and\n\n    m\n have some common divisor greater than \n    1\n); A password cannot be\n\n    x\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x < m\n) if there exist non-negative integers \n    e\n\nand \n    k\n such that \n    p^e = k m + x\n, where \n    p\n is a secret integer;\nAny integer that doesn't break the above rules can be a password; Several\nintegers are hidden in the room, but only one of them can be \n    p\n.\nFortunately, she finds that \n    n\n and \n    m\n are recorded in the lock.\nHowever, what makes Tokitsukaze frustrated is that she doesn't do well in\nmath. Now that she has found an integer that is suspected to be \n    p\n, she\nwants you to help her find out \n    n\n possible passwords, or determine the\ninteger cannot be \n    p\n. Input The only line contains three integers\n\n    n\n, \n    m\n and \n    p\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00d7 10^5\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 p < m \n    \u2264 10^18\n). It is guaranteed that \n    m\n is a positive\ninteger power of a single prime number. Output If the number of possible\ndifferent passwords is less than \n    n\n, print a single integer \n    -1\n.\nOtherwise, print \n    n\n distinct integers ranged from \n    0\n to \n    (m -\n    1)\n as passwords. You can print these integers in any order. Besides, if\nthere are multiple solutions, print any. Examples Input 1 2 1 Output -1 Input\n3 5 1 Output 2 4 3 Input 2 5 4 Output 2 3 Input 4 9 8 Output 2 4 7 5 Note In\nthe first example, there is no possible password. In each of the last three\nexamples, the given integer \n    n\n equals to the number of possible different\npasswords for the given integers \n    m\n and \n    p\n, so if the order of\nnumbers in the output is ignored, the solution is unique as shown above.\n\n",
