        "description": "Recently, cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular. Ann decided that\nit was about time she started mining the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. Ann's\ncomputer is not very powerful, so Ann mines exactly \n    1\n Dogecoin per day.\nOn the Internet, there are forecasts of the cost of \n    1\n dogecoin for the\nnext \n    n\n days. Every day, Ann can sell any amount of dogecoin that she\ncurrently has. Note that if Ann mined Dogecoin on the \n    i\n-th day, then she\ncan sell it on the same day. Ann has not yet decided when to start mining. She\nhas prepared \n    q\n possible plans and for each of them wants to know the\nmaximum profit that she can get. Each of the plans is described by two numbers\n\n    l\n and \n    r\n \u2014 the first and last days of mining. Note that Ann should\nnot have any Dogecoin left after the \n    r\n-th day. Input The first line\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    c_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n), where \n    c_i\n is the cost of Dogecoin on the \n    i\n-th\nday. The third line contains one integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of Ann's plans. The following \n    q\n lines contains two\nintegers \n    l\n and \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the first and\nlast days of mining. Output For each Ann's plan print one integer \u2014 the\nmaximum profit that she can get using this plan. Example Input 5 4 1 2 3 2 4 1\n5 2 4 3 5 5 5 Output 15 9 8 2\n\n",
