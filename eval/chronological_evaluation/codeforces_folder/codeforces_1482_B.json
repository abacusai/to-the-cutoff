        "description": "For the first place at the competition, Alex won many arrays of integers and\nwas assured that these arrays are very expensive. After the award ceremony\nAlex decided to sell them. There is a rule in arrays pawnshop: you can sell\narray only if it can be compressed to a generator. This generator takes four\nnon-negative numbers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, \n    c\n, \n    s\n. \n    n\n and \n    m\n\nmust be positive, \n    s\n non-negative and for \n    c\n it must be true that\n\n    0 \n    \u2264 c < m\n. The array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n is created according\nto the following rules: \n    a_1 = s \n     m\n, here \n    x \n     y\n\ndenotes remainder of the division of \n    x\n by \n    y\n; \n    a_i = (a_i-1 +\n    c) \n     m\n for all \n    i\n such that \n    1 < i \n    \u2264 n\n. For example, if\n\n    n = 5\n, \n    m = 7\n, \n    c = 4\n, and \n    s = 10\n, then \n    a = [3, 0, 4,\n    1, 5]\n. Price of such an array is the value of \n    m\n in this generator.\nAlex has a question: how much money he can get for each of the arrays. Please,\nhelp him to understand for every array whether there exist four numbers\n\n    n\n, \n    m\n, \n    c\n, \n    s\n that generate this array. If yes, then\nmaximize \n    m\n. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of arrays. The first line of array\ndescription contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe size of this array. The second line of array description contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n ) \u2014\nelements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of array sizes does not\nexceed \n    10^5\n. Output For every array print: \n    -1\n, if there are no\nsuch four numbers that generate this array; \n    0\n, if \n    m\n can be\narbitrary large; the maximum value \n    m\n and any appropriate \n    c\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 c < m\n) in other cases.
