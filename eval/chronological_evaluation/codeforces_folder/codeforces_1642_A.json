        "description": "Sam lives in Awesomeburg, its downtown has a triangular shape. Also, the\nfollowing is true about the triangle: its vertices have integer coordinates,\nthe coordinates of vertices are non-negative, and its vertices are not on a\nsingle line. He calls a point on the downtown's border (that is the border of\nthe triangle) safe if he can reach this point from at least one point of the\nline \n    y = 0\n walking along some straight line, without crossing the\ninterior of the triangle. In the picture the downtown is marked with grey\ncolor. The first path is invalid because it does not go along a straight line.\nThe second path is invalid because it intersects with the interior of the\ndowntown. The third and fourth paths are correct. Find the total length of the\nunsafe parts of the downtown border. It can be proven that these parts are\nsegments and their number is finite. Input Each test contains multiple test\ncases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\nEach test case contains three lines, each of them contains two integers\n\n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x_i, y_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 coordinates of the\nvertices of the downtown's border. Output For each test case print a single\nnumber \u2014 the answer to the problem. Your answer will be considered correct if\nits absolute or relative error does not exceed \n    10^-9\n. Formally let\nyour answer be \n    a\n, jury answer be \n    b\n. Your answer will be considered\ncorrect if \n    |a - b|/\n    max(1, |b|)\n    \u2264 10^-9\n. Example\nInput 5 8 10 10 4 6 2 4 6 0 1 4 2 14 1 11 2 13 2 0 0 4 0 2 4 0 1 1 1 0 0\nOutput 0.0000000 0 2.0000 0.00 1 Note In the picture, the downtowns of the\nfirst three test cases are illustrated. Triangles are enumerated according to\nthe indices of test cases they belong to. In the first two test cases, all\npoints on the borders of the downtowns are safe, thus the answers are \n    0\n.\nIn the following picture unsafe points for the third test case are marked with\nblack color: In the fourth test case, all points on the border of the downtown\nare safe.\n\n",
