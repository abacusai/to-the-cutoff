        "description": "In the evening Polycarp decided to analyze his today's travel expenses on\npublic transport. The bus system in the capital of Berland is arranged in such\na way that each bus runs along the route between two stops. Each bus has no\nintermediate stops. So each of the buses continuously runs along the route\nfrom one stop to the other and back. There is at most one bus running between\na pair of stops. Polycarp made n trips on buses. About each trip the stop\nwhere he started the trip and the the stop where he finished are known. The\ntrips follow in the chronological order in Polycarp's notes. It is known that\none trip on any bus costs a burles. In case when passenger makes a\ntransshipment the cost of trip decreases to b burles (b < a). A passenger\nmakes a transshipment if the stop on which he boards the bus coincides with\nthe stop where he left the previous bus. Obviously, the first trip can not be\nmade with transshipment. For example, if Polycarp made three consecutive\ntrips: \"BerBank\" \"University\", \"University\" \"BerMall\", \"University\" \"BerBank\",\nthen he payed a + b + a = 2a + b burles. From the BerBank he arrived to the\nUniversity, where he made transshipment to the other bus and departed to the\nBerMall. Then he walked to the University and returned to the BerBank by bus.\nAlso Polycarp can buy no more than k travel cards. Each travel card costs f\nburles. The travel card for a single bus route makes free of charge any trip\nby this route (in both directions). Once purchased, a travel card can be used\nany number of times in any direction. What is the smallest amount of money\nPolycarp could have spent today if he can buy no more than k travel cards?\nInput The first line contains five integers n, a, b, k, f (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300, 1 \u2264 b\n< a \u2264 100, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 300, 1 \u2264 f \u2264 1000) where: n \u2014 the number of Polycarp trips,\na \u2014 the cost of a regualar single trip, b \u2014 the cost of a trip after a\ntransshipment, k \u2014 the maximum number of travel cards Polycarp can buy, f \u2014\nthe cost of a single travel card. The following n lines describe the trips in\nthe chronological order. Each line contains exactly two different words\nseparated by a single space \u2014 the name of the start stop and the name of the\nfinish stop of the trip. All names consist of uppercase and lowercase English\nletters and have lengths between 1 to 20 letters inclusive. Uppercase and\nlowercase letters should be considered different. Output Print the smallest\namount of money Polycarp could have spent today, if he can purchase no more\nthan k travel cards. Examples Input 3 5 3 1 8 BerBank University University\nBerMall University BerBank Output 11 Input 4 2 1 300 1000 a A A aa aa AA AA a\nOutput 5 Note In the first example Polycarp can buy travel card for the route\n\"BerBank University\" and spend 8 burles. Note that his second trip\n\"University\" \"BerMall\" was made after transshipment, so for this trip Polycarp\npayed 3 burles. So the minimum total sum equals to 8 + 3 = 11 burles. In the\nsecond example it doesn't make sense to buy travel cards. Note that each of\nPolycarp trip (except the first) was made with transshipment. So the minimum\ntotal sum equals to 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 burles.\n\n",
