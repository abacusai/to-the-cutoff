        "description": "Luntik has decided to try singing. He has \n    a\n one-minute songs, \n    b\n\ntwo-minute songs and \n    c\n three-minute songs. He wants to distribute all\nsongs into two concerts such that every song should be included to exactly one\nconcert. He wants to make the absolute difference of durations of the concerts\nas small as possible. The duration of the concert is the sum of durations of\nall songs in that concert. Please help Luntik and find the minimal possible\ndifference in minutes between the concerts durations. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. Each test case consists of one line containing three integers\n\n    a, b, c\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 a, b, c \n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 the number of one-minute,\ntwo-minute and three-minute songs. Output For each test case print the minimal\npossible difference in minutes between the concerts durations. Example Input 4\n1 1 1 2 1 3 5 5 5 1 1 2 Output 0 1 0 1 Note In the first test case, Luntik can\ninclude a one-minute song and a two-minute song into the first concert, and a\nthree-minute song into the second concert. Then the difference will be equal\nto \n    0\n. In the second test case, Luntik can include two one-minute songs\nand a two-minute song and a three-minute song into the first concert, and two\nthree-minute songs into the second concert. The duration of the first concert\nwill be \n    1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7\n, the duration of the second concert will be\n\n    6\n. The difference of them is \n    |7-6| = 1\n.\n\n",
