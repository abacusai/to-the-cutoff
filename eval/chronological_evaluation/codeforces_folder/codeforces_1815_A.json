        "description": "To thank Ian, Mary gifted an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n to Ian. To make\nhimself look smart, he wants to make the array in non-decreasing order by\ndoing the following finitely many times: he chooses two adjacent elements\n\n    a_i\n and \n    a_i+1\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 i\n    \u2264 n-1\n), and increases both of\nthem by \n    1\n or decreases both of them by \n    1\n. Note that, the elements\nof the array can become negative. As a smart person, you notice that, there\nare some arrays such that Ian cannot make it become non-decreasing order!\nTherefore, you decide to write a program to determine if it is possible to\nmake the array in non-decreasing order. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of test cases follows. The first line of each test case consists\nof a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 3\n    \u00b710^5\n) \u2014 the number of\nelements in the array. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the\nelements of the array \n    a\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over\nall test cases does not exceed \n    3\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For each test case,\noutput \"YES\" if there exists a sequence of operations which make the array\nnon-decreasing, else output \"NO\". You may print each letter in any case (for\nexample, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as positive\nanswer). Example Input 5 3 1 3 2 2 2 1 4 1 3 5 7 4 2 1 4 3 5 5 4 3 2 1 Output\nYES NO YES NO YES Note For the first test case, we can increase \n    a_2\n and\n\n    a_3\n both by \n    1\n. The array is now \n    [1, 4, 3]\n. Then we can\ndecrease \n    a_1\n and \n    a_2\n both by \n    1\n. The array is now \n    [0, 3,\n    3]\n, which is sorted in non-decreasing order. So the answer is \"YES\". For\nthe second test case, no matter how Ian perform the operations, \n    a_1\n will\nalways be larger than \n    a_2\n. So the answer is \"NO\" and Ian cannot pretend\nto be smart. For the third test case, the array is already in non-decreasing\norder, so Ian does not need to do anything.\n\n",
