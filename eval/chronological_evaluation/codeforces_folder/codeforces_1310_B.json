        "description": "The biggest event of the year \u2013 Cota 2 world championship \"The Innernational\"\nis right around the corner. \n    2^n\n teams will compete in a double-\nelimination format (please, carefully read problem statement even if you know\nwhat is it) to identify the champion. Teams are numbered from \n    1\n to\n\n    2^n\n and will play games one-on-one. All teams start in the upper\nbracket. All upper bracket matches will be held played between teams that\nhaven't lost any games yet. Teams are split into games by team numbers. Game\nwinner advances in the next round of upper bracket, losers drop into the lower\nbracket. Lower bracket starts with \n    2^n-1\n teams that lost the first\nupper bracket game. Each lower bracket round consists of two games. In the\nfirst game of a round \n    2^k\n teams play a game with each other (teams are\nsplit into games by team numbers). \n    2^k-1\n loosing teams are eliminated\nfrom the championship, \n    2^k-1\n winning teams are playing \n    2^k-1\n\nteams that got eliminated in this round of upper bracket (again, teams are\nsplit into games by team numbers). As a result of each round both upper and\nlower bracket have \n    2^k-1\n teams remaining. See example notes for better\nunderstanding. Single remaining team of upper bracket plays with single\nremaining team of lower bracket in grand-finals to identify championship\nwinner. You are a fan of teams with numbers \n    a_1, a_2, ..., a_k\n. You want\nthe championship to have as many games with your favourite teams as possible.\nLuckily, you can affect results of every championship game the way you want.\nWhat's maximal possible number of championship games that include teams you're\nfan of? Input First input line has two integers \n    n, k\n \u2014 \n    2^n\n teams\nare competing in the championship. You are a fan of \n    k\n teams (\n    2 \n    \u2264\n    n \n    \u2264 17; 0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 2^n\n). Second input line has \n    k\n distinct\nintegers \n    a_1, \n    \u2026, a_k\n \u2014 numbers of teams you're a fan of (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 2^n\n). Output Output single integer \u2014 maximal possible\nnumber of championship games that include teams you're fan of. Examples Input\n3 1 6 Output 6 Input 3 3 1 7 8 Output 11 Input 3 4 1 3 5 7 Output 14 Note On\nthe image, each game of the championship is denoted with an English letter\n(\n    a\n to \n    n\n). Winner of game \n    i\n is denoted as \n    Wi\n, loser is\ndenoted as \n    Li\n. Teams you're a fan of are highlighted with red\nbackground. In the first example, team \n    6\n will play in 6 games if it\nlooses the first upper bracket game (game \n    c\n) and wins all lower bracket\ngames (games \n    h, j, l, m\n). In the second example, teams \n    7\n and\n\n    8\n have to play with each other in the first game of upper bracket (game\n\n    d\n). Team \n    8\n can win all remaining games in upper bracket, when\nteams \n    1\n and \n    7\n will compete in the lower bracket. In the third\nexample, your favourite teams can play in all games of the championship.\n\n",
