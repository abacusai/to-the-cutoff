        "description": "Athenaeus has just finished creating his latest musical composition and will\npresent it tomorrow to the people of Athens. Unfortunately, the melody is\nrather dull and highly likely won't be met with a warm reception. His song\nconsists of \n    n\n notes, which we will treat as positive integers. The\ndiversity of a song is the number of different notes it contains. As a patron\nof music, Euterpe watches over composers and guides them throughout the\nprocess of creating new melodies. She decided to help Athenaeus by changing\nhis song to make it more diverse. Being a minor goddess, she cannot\narbitrarily change the song. Instead, for each of the \n    n\n notes in the\nsong, she can either leave it as it is or increase it by \n    1\n. Given the\nsong as a sequence of integers describing the notes, find out the maximal,\nachievable diversity. Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The\nfirst line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow, each one is\ndescribed in two lines. In the first line of each test case there is a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) denoting the length of the\nsong. The next line contains a sequence of \n    n\n integers \n    x_1, x_2,\n    \n    \u2026, x_n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 x_1 \n    \u2264 x_2 \n    \u2264\n    \u2026\n    \u2264 x_n \n    \u2264\n    2 \n    \u00b7 n)\n, describing the song. The sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, you should output a\nsingle line containing precisely one integer, the maximal diversity of the\nsong, i.e. the maximal possible number of different elements in the final\nsequence. Example Input 5 6 1 2 2 2 5 6 2 4 4 6 1 1 3 4 4 5 1 1 6 1 1 1 2 2 2\nOutput 5 2 6 1 3 Note In the first test case, Euterpe can increase the second,\nfifth and sixth element to obtain the sequence \n    1, \n    3, 2, 2,\n    \n    6, \n    7\n, which has \n    5\n different elements\n(increased elements are underlined). In the second test case, Euterpe can\nincrease the first element to obtain the sequence \n    5, 4\n,\nwhich has \n    2\n different elements. In the third test case, Euterpe can\nincrease the second, fifth and sixth element to obtain the sequence \n    1,\n    \n    2, 3, 4, \n    5, \n    6\n, which has \n    6\n\ndifferent elements.\n\n",
