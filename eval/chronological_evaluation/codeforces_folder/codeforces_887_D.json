        "description": "There are two main kinds of events in the life of top-model: fashion shows and\nphoto shoots. Participating in any of these events affects the rating of\nappropriate top-model. After each photo shoot model's rating increases by a\nand after each fashion show decreases by b (designers do too many experiments\nnowadays). Moreover, sometimes top-models participates in talk shows. After\nparticipating in talk show model becomes more popular and increasing of her\nrating after photo shoots become c and decreasing of her rating after fashion\nshow becomes d. Izabella wants to participate in a talk show, but she wants to\ndo it in such a way that her rating will never become negative. Help her to\nfind a suitable moment for participating in the talk show. Let's assume that\nmodel's career begins in moment 0. At that moment Izabella's rating was equal\nto start. If talk show happens in moment t if will affect all events in\nmodel's life in interval of time [t..t + len) (including t and not including t\n+ len), where len is duration of influence. Izabella wants to participate in a\ntalk show, but she wants to do it in such a way that her rating will not\nbecome become negative before talk show or during period of influence of talk\nshow. Help her to find a suitable moment for participating in the talk show.\nInput In first line there are 7 positive integers n, a, b, c, d, start, len (1\n\u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5, 0 \u2264 start \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 a, b, c, d, len \u2264 10^9), where n is a\nnumber of fashion shows and photo shoots, a, b, c and d are rating changes\ndescribed above, start is an initial rating of model and len is a duration of\ninfluence of talk show. In next n lines descriptions of events are given. Each\nof those lines contains two integers ti and qi (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 q \u2264 1) \u2014\nmoment, in which event happens and type of this event. Type 0 corresponds to\nthe fashion show and type 1 \u2014 to photo shoot. Events are given in order of\nincreasing ti, all ti are different. Output Print one non-negative integer t \u2014\nthe moment of time in which talk show should happen to make Izabella's rating\nnon-negative before talk show and during period of influence of talk show. If\nthere are multiple answers print smallest of them. If there are no such\nmoments, print - 1. Examples Input 5 1 1 1 4 0 5 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 0 5 0 Output 6\nInput 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 0 Output -1\n\n",
