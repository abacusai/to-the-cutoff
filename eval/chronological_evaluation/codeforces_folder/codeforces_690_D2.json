        "description": "Heidi the Cow is aghast: cracks in the northern Wall? Zombies gathering\noutside, forming groups, preparing their assault? This must not happen!\nQuickly, she fetches her HC^2 (Handbook of Crazy Constructions) and looks for\nthe right chapter: How to build a wall: Take a set of bricks. Select one of\nthe possible wall designs. Computing the number of possible designs is left as\nan exercise to the reader. Place bricks on top of each other, according to the\nchosen design. This seems easy enough. But Heidi is a Coding Cow, not a\nConstructing Cow. Her mind keeps coming back to point 2b. Despite the imminent\ndanger of a zombie onslaught, she wonders just how many possible walls she\ncould build with up to n bricks. A wall is a set of wall segments as defined\nin the easy version. How many different walls can be constructed such that the\nwall consists of at least 1 and at most n bricks? Two walls are different if\nthere exist a column c and a row r such that one wall has a brick in this\nspot, and the other does not. Along with n, you will be given C, the width of\nthe wall (as defined in the easy version). Return the number of different\nwalls modulo 10^6 + 3. Input The first line contains two space-separated\nintegers n and C, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 500000, 1 \u2264 C \u2264 200000. Output Print the number of\ndifferent walls that Heidi could build, modulo 10^6 + 3. Examples Input 5 1\nOutput 5 Input 2 2 Output 5 Input 3 2 Output 9 Input 11 5 Output 4367 Input 37\n63 Output 230574 Note The number 10^6 + 3 is prime. In the second sample case,\nthe five walls are: B B B., .B, BB, B., and .B In the third sample case, the\nnine walls are the five as in the second sample case and in addition the\nfollowing four: B B B B B B B., .B, BB, and BB\n\n",
