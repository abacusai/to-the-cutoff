        "description": "Let's call a sequence of integers \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_k\n MEX-correct if\nfor all \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 k\n) \n    |x_i - \n    MEX(x_1,\n    x_2, \n    \u2026, x_i)| \n    \u2264 1\n holds. Where \n    MEX(x_1,\n    \n    \u2026, x_k)\n is the minimum non-negative integer that doesn't belong to\nthe set \n    x_1, \n    \u2026, x_k\n. For example, \n    MEX(1, 0, 1,\n    3) = 2\n and \n    MEX(2, 1, 5) = 0\n. You are given an array\n\n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n non-negative integers. Calculate the number of\nnon-empty MEX-correct subsequences of a given array. The number of\nsubsequences can be very large, so print it modulo \n    998244353\n. Note: a\nsubsequence of an array \n    a\n is a sequence \n    [a_i_1, a_i_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_i_m]\n meeting the constraints \n    1 \n    \u2264 i_1 < i_2 < \n    \u2026 < i_m \n    \u2264\n    n\n. If two different ways to choose the sequence of indices \n    [i_1, i_2,\n    \n    \u2026, i_m]\n yield the same subsequence, the resulting subsequence should\nbe counted twice (i. e. two subsequences are different if their sequences of\nindices \n    [i_1, i_2, \n    \u2026, i_m]\n are not the same). Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n). The sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed \n    5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case, print a single integer \u2014 the number of non-empty MEX-correct\nsubsequences of a given array, taken modulo \n    998244353\n. Example Input 4 3\n0 2 1 2 1 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 2 3 Output 4 2 31 7 Note In the first example,\nthe valid subsequences are \n    [0]\n, \n    [1]\n, \n    [0,1]\n and \n    [0,2]\n.\nIn the second example, the valid subsequences are \n    [0]\n and \n    [1]\n. In\nthe third example, any non-empty subsequence is valid.\n\n",
