        "description": "You are given an undirected tree consisting of \n    n\n vertices. An undirected\ntree is a connected undirected graph with \n    n - 1\n edges. Your task is to\nadd the minimum number of edges in such a way that the length of the shortest\npath from the vertex \n    1\n to any other vertex is at most \n    2\n. Note that\nyou are not allowed to add loops and multiple edges. Input The first line\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of vertices in the tree. The following \n    n - 1\n lines contain edges:\nedge \n    i\n is given as a pair of vertices \n    u_i, v_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i,\n    v_i \n    \u2264 n\n). It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is\nguaranteed that there are no loops and multiple edges in the given edges.\nOutput Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of edges you have to add in\norder to make the shortest distance from the vertex \n    1\n to any other\nvertex at most \n    2\n. Note that you are not allowed to add loops and\nmultiple edges. Examples Input 7 1 2 2 3 2 4 4 5 4 6 5 7 Output 2 Input 7 1 2\n1 3 2 4 2 5 3 6 1 7 Output 0 Input 7 1 2 2 3 3 4 3 5 3 6 3 7 Output 1 Note The\ntree corresponding to the first example: The answer is \n    2\n, some of the\npossible answers are the following: \n    [(1, 5), (1, 6)]\n, \n    [(1, 4), (1,\n    7)]\n, \n    [(1, 6), (1, 7)]\n. The tree corresponding to the second example:\nThe answer is \n    0\n. The tree corresponding to the third example: The answer\nis \n    1\n, only one possible way to reach it is to add the edge \n    (1, 3)\n.\n\n",
