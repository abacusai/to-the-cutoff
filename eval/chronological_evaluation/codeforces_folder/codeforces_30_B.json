        "description": "The king Copa often has been reported about the Codeforces site, which is\nrapidly getting more and more popular among the brightest minds of the\nhumanity, who are using it for training and competing. Recently Copa\nunderstood that to conquer the world he needs to organize the world Codeforces\ntournament. He hopes that after it the brightest minds will become his\nsubordinates, and the toughest part of conquering the world will be completed.\nThe final round of the Codeforces World Finals 20YY is scheduled for DD.MM.YY,\nwhere DD is the day of the round, MM is the month and YY are the last two\ndigits of the year. Bob is lucky to be the first finalist form Berland. But\nthere is one problem: according to the rules of the competition, all\nparticipants must be at least 18 years old at the moment of the finals. Bob\nwas born on BD.BM.BY. This date is recorded in his passport, the copy of which\nhe has already mailed to the organizers. But Bob learned that in different\ncountries the way, in which the dates are written, differs. For example, in\nthe US the month is written first, then the day and finally the year. Bob\nwonders if it is possible to rearrange the numbers in his date of birth so\nthat he will be at least 18 years old on the day DD.MM.YY. He can always tell\nthat in his motherland dates are written differently. Help him. According to\nanother strange rule, eligible participant must be born in the same century as\nthe date of the finals. If the day of the finals is participant's 18-th\nbirthday, he is allowed to participate. As we are considering only the years\nfrom 2001 to 2099 for the year of the finals, use the following rule: the year\nis leap if it's number is divisible by four. Input The first line contains the\ndate DD.MM.YY, the second line contains the date BD.BM.BY. It is guaranteed\nthat both dates are correct, and YY and BY are always in [01;99]. It could be\nthat by passport Bob was born after the finals. In this case, he can still\nchange the order of numbers in date. Output If it is possible to rearrange the\nnumbers in the date of birth so that Bob will be at least 18 years old on the\nDD.MM.YY, output YES. In the other case, output NO. Each number contains\nexactly two digits and stands for day, month or year in a date. Note that it\nis permitted to rearrange only numbers, not digits. Examples Input 01.01.98\n01.01.80 Output YES Input 20.10.20 10.02.30 Output NO Input 28.02.74 28.02.64\nOutput NO\n\n",
