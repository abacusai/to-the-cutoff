        "description": "You are given a binary array\n    ^\n    \u2020\n of length \n    n\n. You are\nallowed to perform one operation on it at most once. In an operation, you can\nchoose any element and flip it: turn a \n    0\n into a \n    1\n or vice-versa.\nWhat is the maximum number of inversions\n    ^\n the array can have\nafter performing at most one operation? \n    ^\n    \u2020\n A binary array is an\narray that contains only zeroes and ones. \n    ^\n The number of\ninversions in an array is the number of pairs of indices \n    i,j\n such that\n\n    i a_j\n. Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each\ntest case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b710^5\n) \u2014\nthe length of the array. The following line contains \n    n\n space-separated\npositive integers \n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n,..., \n    a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    1\n) \u2014 the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n\nover all test cases does not exceed \n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For each test\ncase, output a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of inversions the array can\nhave after performing at most one operation. Example Input 5 4 1 0 1 0 6 0 1 0\n0 1 0 2 0 0 8 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 3 1 1 1 Output 3 7 1 13 2 Note For the first\ntest case, the inversions are initially formed by the pairs of indices (\n    1,\n    2\n), (\n    1, 4\n), (\n    3, 4\n), being a total of \n    3\n, which already is\nthe maximum possible. For the second test case, the inversions are initially\nformed by the pairs of indices (\n    2, 3\n), (\n    2, 4\n), (\n    2, 6\n),\n(\n    5, 6\n), being a total of four. But, by flipping the first element, the\narray becomes \n    1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0\n, which has the inversions formed by the\npairs of indices (\n    1, 3\n), (\n    1, 4\n), (\n    1, 6\n), (\n    2, 3\n),\n(\n    2, 4\n), (\n    2, 6\n), (\n    5, 6\n) which total to \n    7\n inversions\nwhich is the maximum possible.\n\n",
