        "description": "This is the easier version of the problem. In this version \n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m\n    \n    \u2264 100\n. You can hack this problem only if you solve and lock both\nproblems. You are given a sequence of integers \n    a=[a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n]\n\nof length \n    n\n. Its subsequence is obtained by removing zero or more\nelements from the sequence \n    a\n (they do not necessarily go consecutively).\nFor example, for the sequence \n    a=[11,20,11,33,11,20,11]\n:\n\n    [11,20,11,33,11,20,11]\n, \n    [11,20,11,33,11,20]\n, \n    [11,11,11,11]\n,\n\n    [20]\n, \n    [33,20]\n are subsequences (these are just some of the long\nlist); \n    [40]\n, \n    [33,33]\n, \n    [33,20,20]\n, \n    [20,20,11,11]\n are\nnot subsequences. Suppose that an additional non-negative integer \n    k\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n) is given, then the subsequence is called optimal if:\nit has a length of \n    k\n and the sum of its elements is the maximum possible\namong all subsequences of length \n    k\n; and among all subsequences of length\n\n    k\n that satisfy the previous item, it is lexicographically minimal.\nRecall that the sequence \n    b=[b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_k]\n is lexicographically\nsmaller than the sequence \n    c=[c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_k]\n if the first\nelement (from the left) in which they differ less in the sequence \n    b\n than\nin \n    c\n. Formally: there exists \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 k\n) such that\n\n    b_1=c_1\n, \n    b_2=c_2\n, ..., \n    b_t-1=c_t-1\n and at the same time\n\n    b_t<c_t\n. For example: \n    [10, 20, 20]\n lexicographically less than\n\n    [10, 21, 1]\n, \n    [7, 99, 99]\n is lexicographically less than \n    [10,\n    21, 1]\n, \n    [10, 21, 0]\n is lexicographically less than \n    [10, 21, 1]\n.\nYou are given a sequence of \n    a=[a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n]\n and \n    m\n\nrequests, each consisting of two numbers \n    k_j\n and \n    pos_j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    k \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 pos_j \n    \u2264 k_j\n). For each query, print the value\nthat is in the index \n    pos_j\n of the optimal subsequence of the given\nsequence \n    a\n for \n    k=k_j\n. For example, if \n    n=4\n,\n\n    a=[10,20,30,20]\n, \n    k_j=2\n, then the optimal subsequence is\n\n    [20,30]\n \u2014 it is the minimum lexicographically among all subsequences of\nlength \n    2\n with the maximum total sum of items. Thus, the answer to the\nrequest \n    k_j=2\n, \n    pos_j=1\n is the number \n    20\n, and the answer to\nthe request \n    k_j=2\n, \n    pos_j=2\n is the number \n    30\n. Input The first\nline contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the length of\nthe sequence \n    a\n. The second line contains elements of the sequence\n\n    a\n: integer numbers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n). The third line contains an integer \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264\n    100\n) \u2014 the number of requests. The following \n    m\n lines contain pairs of\nintegers \n    k_j\n and \n    pos_j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 pos_j\n    \n    \u2264 k_j\n) \u2014 the requests. Output Print \n    m\n integers \n    r_1, r_2,\n    \n    \u2026, r_m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 r_j \n    \u2264 10^9\n) one per line: answers to the\nrequests in the order they appear in the input. The value of \n    r_j\n should\nbe equal to the value contained in the position \n    pos_j\n of the optimal\nsubsequence for \n    k=k_j\n.
