        "description": "Reziba has many magic gems. Each magic gem can be split into \n    M\n normal\ngems. The amount of space each magic (and normal) gem takes is \n    1\n unit. A\nnormal gem cannot be split. Reziba wants to choose a set of magic gems and\nsplit some of them, so the total space occupied by the resulting set of gems\nis \n    N\n units. If a magic gem is chosen and split, it takes \n    M\n units\nof space (since it is split into \n    M\n gems); if a magic gem is not split,\nit takes \n    1\n unit. How many different configurations of the resulting set\nof gems can Reziba have, such that the total amount of space taken is \n    N\n\nunits? Print the answer modulo \n    1000000007\n (\n    10^9+7\n). Two\nconfigurations are considered different if the number of magic gems Reziba\ntakes to form them differs, or the indices of gems Reziba has to split differ.\nInput The input contains a single line consisting of \n    2\n integers \n    N\n\nand \n    M\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 10^18\n, \n    2 \n    \u2264 M \n    \u2264 100\n). Output\nPrint one integer, the total number of configurations of the resulting set of\ngems, given that the total amount of space taken is \n    N\n units. Print the\nanswer modulo \n    1000000007\n (\n    10^9+7\n). Examples Input 4 2 Output 5\nInput 3 2 Output 3 Note In the first example each magic gem can split into\n\n    2\n normal gems, and we know that the total amount of gems are \n    4\n.\nLet \n    1\n denote a magic gem, and \n    0\n denote a normal gem. The total\nconfigurations you can have is: \n    1 1 1 1\n (None of the gems split); \n    0 0\n    1 1\n (First magic gem splits into \n    2\n normal gems); \n    1 0 0 1\n\n(Second magic gem splits into \n    2\n normal gems); \n    1 1 0 0\n (Third magic\ngem splits into \n    2\n normal gems); \n    0 0 0 0\n (First and second magic\ngems split into total \n    4\n normal gems). Hence, answer is \n    5\n.\n\n",
