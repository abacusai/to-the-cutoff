        "description": "The tic-tac-toe game is starting on a tree of \n    n\n vertices. Some vertices\nare already colored in white while the remaining are uncolored. There are two\nplayers \u2014 white and black. The players make moves alternatively. The white\nplayer starts the game. In his turn, a player must select one uncolored vertex\nand paint it in his color. The player wins if he paints some path of three\nvertices in his color. In case all vertices are colored and neither player\nwon, the game ends in a draw. Could you please find who will win the game or\nwhether it ends as a draw, assuming both players play optimally? Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264 50\n     000\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. Then descriptions of \n    T\n test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree. Each of the\nfollowing \n    n - 1\n lines contains integers \n    v\n, \n    u\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 v,\n    u \n    \u2264 n\n) denoting an edge of the tree connecting vertices \n    v\n and\n\n    u\n. The last line of a test case contains a string of letters 'W' (for\nwhite) and 'N' (for not colored) of length \n    n\n denoting already colored\nvertices. Vertexes already colored in white are denoted as 'W'. It's\nguaranteed that the given edges form a tree, that there is at least one\nuncolored vertex and that there is no path of three white vertices. It's\nguaranteed that sum of all \n    n\n among all test cases is at most \n    5\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For every test case, print either \"White\", \"Draw\" or\n\"Black\", depending on the result of the game. Example Input 2 4 1 2 1 3 1 4\nNNNW 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 NNNNN Output White Draw Note In the first example,\nvertex \n    4\n is already colored in white. The white player can win by\ncoloring the vertex \n    1\n in white first and the remaining vertex on his\nsecond turn. The process is illustrated with the pictures below. In the second\nexample, we can show that no player can enforce their victory.\n\n",
