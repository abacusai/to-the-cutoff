        "description": "You are given a special jigsaw puzzle consisting of \n    n\n    \u00b7 m\n identical\npieces. Every piece has three tabs and one blank, as pictured below. The\njigsaw puzzle is considered solved if the following conditions hold: The\npieces are arranged into a grid with \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n columns. For any\ntwo pieces that share an edge in the grid, a tab of one piece fits perfectly\ninto a blank of the other piece. Through rotation and translation of the\npieces, determine if it is possible to solve the jigsaw puzzle. Input The test\nconsists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Next \n    t\n\nlines contain descriptions of test cases. Each test case contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n,m \n    \u2264 10^5\n). Output For each test case\noutput a single line containing \"YES\" if it is possible to solve the jigsaw\npuzzle, or \"NO\" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or\nlower). Example Input 3 1 3 100000 100000 2 2 Output YES NO YES Note For the\nfirst test case, this is an example solution: For the second test case, we can\nshow that no solution exists. For the third test case, this is an example\nsolution:\n\n",
