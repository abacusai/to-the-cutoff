        "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, they are given a non-empty string\n\n    s\n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string is\neven. Each player also has a string of their own, initially empty. Alice\nstarts, then they alternate moves. In one move, a player takes either the\nfirst or the last letter of the string \n    s\n, removes it from \n    s\n and\nprepends (adds to the beginning) it to their own string. The game ends when\nthe string \n    s\n becomes empty. The winner is the player with a\nlexicographically smaller string. If the players' strings are equal, then it's\na draw. A string \n    a\n is lexicographically smaller than a string \n    b\n if\nthere exists such position \n    i\n that \n    a_j = b_j\n for all \n    j < i\n\nand \n    a_i < b_i\n. What is the result of the game if both players play\noptimally (e. g. both players try to win; if they can't, then try to draw)?\nInput The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of a single line \u2014\na non-empty string \n    s\n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length\nof the string \n    s\n is even. The total length of the strings over all\ntestcases doesn't exceed \n    2000\n. Output For each testcase, print the\nresult of the game if both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print\n\"Alice\". If Bob wins, print \"Bob\". If it's a draw, print \"Draw\". Example Input\n2 forces abba Output Alice Draw Note One of the possible games Alice and Bob\ncan play in the first testcase: Alice picks the first letter in \n    s\n:\n\n    s=\n\"orces\", \n    a=\n\"f\", \n    b=\n\"\"; Bob picks the last letter in\n\n    s\n: \n    s=\n\"orce\", \n    a=\n\"f\", \n    b=\n\"s\"; Alice picks the last letter\nin \n    s\n: \n    s=\n\"orc\", \n    a=\n\"ef\", \n    b=\n\"s\"; Bob picks the first\nletter in \n    s\n: \n    s=\n\"rc\", \n    a=\n\"ef\", \n    b=\n\"os\"; Alice picks the\nlast letter in \n    s\n: \n    s=\n\"r\", \n    a=\n\"cef\", \n    b=\n\"os\"; Bob picks\nthe remaining letter in \n    s\n: \n    s=\n\"\", \n    a=\n\"cef\", \n    b=\n\"ros\".\nAlice wins because \"cef\" < \"ros\". Neither of the players follows any strategy\nin this particular example game, so it doesn't show that Alice wins if both\nplay optimally.\n\n",
