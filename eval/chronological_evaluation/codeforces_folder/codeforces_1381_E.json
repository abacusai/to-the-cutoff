        "description": "After being discouraged by 13 time-limit-exceeded verdicts on an ugly geometry\nproblem, you decided to take a relaxing break for arts and crafts. There is a\npiece of paper in the shape of a simple polygon with \n    n\n vertices. The\npolygon may be non-convex, but we all know that proper origami paper has the\nproperty that any horizontal line intersects the boundary of the polygon in at\nmost two points. If you fold the paper along the vertical line \n    x=f\n, what\nwill be the area of the resulting shape? When you fold, the part of the paper\nto the left of the line is symmetrically reflected on the right side. Your\ntask is to answer \n    q\n independent queries for values\n\n    f_1,\n    \u2026,f_q\n. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n,\n\n    q\n (\n    3\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 10^5, 1\n    \u2264 q\n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of polygon\nvertices and queries, respectively. Each of the next \n    n\n lines contains\ntwo integers \n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n (\n    |x_i|, |y_i|\n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the\ncoordinates of the \n    i\n-th point of the polygon. The polygon has an edge\nconnecting each pair of adjacent points in the input, and also an edge between\n\n    (x_1,y_1)\n and \n    (x_n,y_n)\n. It is guaranteed that the polygon is non-\ndegenerate and that any horizontal line intersects the boundary of the polygon\nin at most two points. In particular, no boundary edge is strictly horizontal.\nTwo adjacent sides may be collinear. Each of the next \n    q\n lines contains a\nsingle integer \n    f_i\n (\n    min\n    _j=1^n(x_j)< f_i<\n    \n    max\n    _j=1^n(x_j)\n) \u2014 the \n    x\n-coordinate of the \n    i\n-th\nfold query. It is guaranteed that all \n    f_i\n are distinct. Output For each\nquery, output the area \n    A_i\n of the paper if you fold it along the line\n\n    x=f_i\n. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative\nerror does not exceed \n    10^-4\n. Formally, let your answer be \n    a\n, and\nthe jury's answer be \n    b\n. Your answer is accepted if and only if\n\n    |a - b|/\n    max(1, |b|)\n    \u2264 10^-4\n.
