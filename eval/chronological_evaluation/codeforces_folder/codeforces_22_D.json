You can drive a nail in any integer\npoint on the Ox-axis line nail so, that all segments containing this point,\nare considered nailed down. If the nail passes through endpoint of some\nsegment, this segment is considered to be nailed too. What is the smallest\nnumber of nails needed to nail all the segments down? Input The first line of\nthe input contains single integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 amount of\nsegments. Following n lines contain descriptions of the segments. Each\ndescription is a pair of integer numbers \u2014 endpoints coordinates. All the\ncoordinates don't exceed 10000 by absolute value. Segments can degenarate to\npoints. Output The first line should contain one integer number \u2014 the smallest\nnumber of nails needed to nail all the segments down. The second line should\ncontain coordinates of driven nails separated by space in any order. If the\nanswer is not unique, output any.
