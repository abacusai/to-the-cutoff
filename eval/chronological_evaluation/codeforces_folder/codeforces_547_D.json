        "description": "As everyone knows, bears love fish. But Mike is a strange bear; He hates fish!\nThe even more strange thing about him is he has an infinite number of blue and\nred fish. He has marked n distinct points in the plane. i-th point is point\n(xi, yi). He wants to put exactly one fish in each of these points such that\nthe difference between the number of red fish and the blue fish on each\nhorizontal or vertical line is at most 1. He can't find a way to perform that!\nPlease help him. Input The first line of input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u00d7\n10^5). The next n lines contain the information about the points, i-th line\ncontains two integers xi and yi (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5), the i-th point\ncoordinates. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid answer. Output\nPrint the answer as a sequence of n characters 'r' (for red) or 'b' (for blue)\nwhere i-th character denotes the color of the fish in the i-th point. Examples\nInput 4 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 Output brrb Input 3 1 1 1 2 2 1 Output brr\n\n",
