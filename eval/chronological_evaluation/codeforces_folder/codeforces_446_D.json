        "description": "Today DZY begins to play an old game. In this game, he is in a big maze with n\nrooms connected by m corridors (each corridor allows to move in both\ndirections). You can assume that all the rooms are connected with corridors\ndirectly or indirectly. DZY has got lost in the maze. Currently he is in the\nfirst room and has k lives. He will act like the follows: Firstly he will\nrandomly pick one of the corridors going from his current room. Each outgoing\ncorridor has the same probability to be picked. Then he will go through the\ncorridor and then the process repeats. There are some rooms which have traps\nin them. The first room definitely has no trap, the n-th room definitely has a\ntrap. Each time DZY enters one of these rooms, he will lost one life. Now, DZY\nknows that if he enters the n-th room with exactly 2 lives, firstly he will\nlost one live, but then he will open a bonus round. He wants to know the\nprobability for him to open the bonus round. Please, help him. Input The first\nline contains three integers n, m, k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 500; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5; 2 \u2264 k \u2264\n10^9). The second line contains n integers, each of them is either 0 or 1. If\nthe i-th number is 1, then the i-th room has a trap, otherwise it has not a\ntrap. Please note, that the number of rooms with a trap is no more than 101.\nIt is guaranteed that the first room has no trap, and the n-th room has a\ntrap. Then m lines follows. Each of them contains two integers ui, vi (1 \u2264 ui,\nvi \u2264 n; ui \u2260 vi), meaning that current corridor connects two rooms ui and vi.\nIt is guaranteed that the corridor system is connected. Output Print the only\nreal number \u2014 the probability for DZY to open the bonus round. The answer will\nbe considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10^-4.\nExamples Input 5 5 3 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 1 2 Output 0.25000000 Input 3 2\n2 0 1 1 1 2 2 3 Output -0.00000000 Input 2 1 3 0 1 1 2 Output 1.00000000\n\n",
