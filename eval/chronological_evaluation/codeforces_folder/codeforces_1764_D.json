        "description": "Doremy has \n    n+1\n pegs. There are \n    n\n red pegs arranged as vertices of\na regular \n    n\n-sided polygon, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n in anti-\nclockwise order. There is also a blue peg of slightly smaller diameter in the\nmiddle of the polygon. A rubber band is stretched around the red pegs. Doremy\nis very bored today and has decided to play a game. Initially, she has an\nempty array \n    a\n. While the rubber band does not touch the blue peg, she\nwill: choose \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) such that the red peg \n    i\n\nhas not been removed; remove the red peg \n    i\n; append \n    i\n to the back\nof \n    a\n. Doremy wonders how many possible different arrays \n    a\n can be\nproduced by the following process. Since the answer can be big, you are only\nrequired to output it modulo \n    p\n. \n    p\n is guaranteed to be a prime\nnumber. game with \n    n=9\n and \n    a=[7,5,2,8,3,9,4]\n and another game with\n\n    n=8\n and \n    a=[3,4,7,1,8,5,2]\n Input The first line contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    p\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5000\n, \n    10^8 \n    \u2264 p\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of red pegs and the modulo respectively. \n    p\n\nis guaranteed to be a prime number. Output Output a single integer, the number\nof different arrays \n    a\n that can be produced by the process described\nabove modulo \n    p\n. Examples Input 4 100000007 Output 16 Input 1145\n141919831 Output 105242108 Note In the first test case, \n    n=4\n, some\npossible arrays \n    a\n that can be produced are \n    [4,2,3]\n and\n\n    [1,4]\n. However, it is not possible for \n    a\n to be \n    [1]\n or\n\n    [1,4,3]\n.\n\n",
