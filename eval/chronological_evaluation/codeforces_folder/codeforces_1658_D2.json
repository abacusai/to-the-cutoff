        "description": "This is the hard version of the problem. The difference in the constraints\nbetween both versions are colored below in red. You can make hacks only if all\nversions of the problem are solved. Marin and Gojou are playing hide-and-seek\nwith an array. Gojou initially perform the following steps: First, Gojou\nchooses \n    2\n integers \n    l\n and \n    r\n such that \n    l \n    \u2264 r\n. Then,\nGojou will make an array \n    a\n of length \n    r-l+1\n which is a permutation\nof the array \n    [l,l+1,\n    \u2026,r]\n. Finally, Gojou chooses a secret integer\n\n    x\n and sets \n    a_i\n to \n    a_i \n    \u2295 x\n for all \n    i\n (where\n\n    \u2295\n denotes the bitwise XOR operation). Marin is then given the\nvalues of \n    l,r\n and the final array \n    a\n. She needs to find the secret\ninteger \n    x\n to win. Can you help her? Note that there may be multiple\npossible \n    x\n that Gojou could have chosen. Marin can find any possible\n\n    x\n that could have resulted in the final value of \n    a\n. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. In the first line of each test case contains two\nintegers \n    l\n and \n    r\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264\n    l\n    \u2264 r < 2^17\n). The second line\ncontains \n    r - l + 1\n space-seperated integers of\n\n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_r-l+1\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i < 2^17\n). It is\nguaranteed that array \n    a\n is valid. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    r\n    - l + 1\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2^17\n. Output For each\ntest case print an integer \n    x\n. If there are multiple answers, print any.\nExample Input 3 4 7 3 2 1 0 4 7 4 7 6 5 1 3 0 2 1 Output 4 0 3 Note In the\nfirst test case, the original array is \n    [7, 6, 5, 4]\n. In the second test\ncase, the original array is \n    [4, 7, 6, 5]\n. In the third test case, the\noriginal array is \n    [3, 1, 2]\n.\n\n",
