        "description": "You got a job as a marketer in a pet shop, and your current task is to boost\nsales of cat food. One of the strategies is to sell cans of food in packs with\ndiscounts. Suppose you decided to sell packs with \n    a\n cans in a pack with\na discount and some customer wants to buy \n    x\n cans of cat food. Then he\nfollows a greedy strategy: he buys \n    \u230a\n    x/a\n    \n    \u230b\n packs with a discount; then he wants to buy the remaining\n\n    (x \n     a)\n cans one by one. \n    \u230a\n    x/a\n    \n    \u230b\n is \n    x\n divided by \n    a\n rounded down, \n    x \n    \n    a\n is the remainer of \n    x\n divided by \n    a\n. But customers are greedy\nin general, so if the customer wants to buy \n    (x \n     a)\n cans one by\none and it happens that \n    (x \n     a) \n    \u2265\n    a/2\n he decides to\nbuy the whole pack of \n    a\n cans (instead of buying \n    (x \n     a)\n\ncans). It makes you, as a marketer, happy since the customer bought more than\nhe wanted initially. You know that each of the customers that come to your\nshop can buy any number of cans from \n    l\n to \n    r\n inclusive. Can you\nchoose such size of pack \n    a\n that each customer buys more cans than they\nwanted initially? Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first and only line of\neach test case contains two integers \n    l\n and \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the range of the number of cans customers can buy. Output For\neach test case, print YES if you can choose such size of pack \n    a\n that\neach customer buys more cans than they wanted initially. Otherwise, print NO.\nYou can print each character in any case. Example Input 3 3 4 1 2 120 150\nOutput YES NO YES Note In the first test case, you can take, for example, \n    a\n    = 5\n as the size of the pack. Then if a customer wants to buy \n    3\n cans,\nhe'll buy \n    5\n instead (\n    3 \n     5 = 3\n, \n    5/2 = 2.5\n).\nThe one who wants \n    4\n cans will also buy \n    5\n cans. In the second test\ncase, there is no way to choose \n    a\n. In the third test case, you can take,\nfor example, \n    a = 80\n.\n\n",
