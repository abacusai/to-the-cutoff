        "description": "You are given a broken clock. You know, that it is supposed to show time in\n12- or 24-hours HH:MM format. In 12-hours format hours change from 1 to 12,\nwhile in 24-hours it changes from 0 to 23. In both formats minutes change from\n0 to 59. You are given a time in format HH:MM that is currently displayed on\nthe broken clock. Your goal is to change minimum number of digits in order to\nmake clocks display the correct time in the given format. For example, if\n00:99 is displayed, it is enough to replace the second 9 with 3 in order to\nget 00:39 that is a correct time in 24-hours format. However, to make 00:99\ncorrect in 12-hours format, one has to change at least two digits.\nAdditionally to the first change one can replace the second 0 with 1 and\nobtain 01:39. Input The first line of the input contains one integer 12 or 24,\nthat denote 12-hours or 24-hours format respectively. The second line contains\nthe time in format HH:MM, that is currently displayed on the clock. First two\ncharacters stand for the hours, while next two show the minutes. Output The\nonly line of the output should contain the time in format HH:MM that is a\ncorrect time in the given format. It should differ from the original in as few\npositions as possible. If there are many optimal solutions you can print any\nof them. Examples Input 24 17:30 Output 17:30 Input 12 17:30 Output 07:30\nInput 24 99:99 Output 09:09\n\n",
