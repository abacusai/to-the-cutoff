        "description": "A tennis tournament with n participants is running. The participants are\nplaying by an olympic system, so the winners move on and the losers drop out.\nThe tournament takes place in the following way (below, m is the number of the\nparticipants of the current round): let k be the maximal power of the number 2\nsuch that k \u2264 m, k participants compete in the current round and a half of\nthem passes to the next round, the other m - k participants pass to the next\nround directly, when only one participant remains, the tournament finishes.\nEach match requires b bottles of water for each participant and one bottle for\nthe judge. Besides p towels are given to each participant for the whole\ntournament. Find the number of bottles and towels needed for the tournament.\nNote that it's a tennis tournament so in each match two participants compete\n(one of them will win and the other will lose). Input The only line contains\nthree integers n, b, p (1 \u2264 n, b, p \u2264 500) \u2014 the number of participants and\nthe parameters described in the problem statement. Output Print two integers x\nand y \u2014 the number of bottles and towels need for the tournament. Examples\nInput 5 2 3 Output 20 15 Input 8 2 4 Output 35 32 Note In the first example\nwill be three rounds: in the first round will be two matches and for each\nmatch 5 bottles of water are needed (two for each of the participants and one\nfor the judge), in the second round will be only one match, so we need another\n5 bottles of water, in the third round will also be only one match, so we need\nanother 5 bottles of water. So in total we need 20 bottles of water. In the\nsecond example no participant will move on to some round directly.\n\n",
