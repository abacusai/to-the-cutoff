        "description": "George woke up and saw the current time s on the digital clock. Besides,\nGeorge knows that he has slept for time t. Help George! Write a program that\nwill, given time s and t, determine the time p when George went to bed. Note\nthat George could have gone to bed yesterday relatively to the current time\n(see the second test sample). Input The first line contains current time s as\na string in the format \"hh:mm\". The second line contains time t in the format\n\"hh:mm\" \u2014 the duration of George's sleep. It is guaranteed that the input\ncontains the correct time in the 24-hour format, that is, 00 \u2264 hh \u2264 23, 00 \u2264\nmm \u2264 59. Output In the single line print time p \u2014 the time George went to bed\nin the format similar to the format of the time in the input. Examples Input\n05:50 05:44 Output 00:06 Input 00:00 01:00 Output 23:00 Input 00:01 00:00\nOutput 00:01 Note In the first sample George went to bed at \"00:06\". Note that\nyou should print the time only in the format \"00:06\". That's why answers\n\"0:06\", \"00:6\" and others will be considered incorrect. In the second sample,\nGeorge went to bed yesterday. In the third sample, George didn't do to bed at\nall.\n\n",
