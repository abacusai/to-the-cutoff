        "description": "Inna, Dima and Sereja are in one room together. It's cold outside, so Sereja\nsuggested to play a board game called \"Babies\". The babies playing board is an\ninfinite plane containing n blue babies and m red ones. Each baby is a segment\nthat grows in time. At time moment t the blue baby (x, y) is a blue segment\nwith ends at points (x - t, y + t), (x + t, y - t). Similarly, at time t the\nred baby (x, y) is a red segment with ends at points (x + t, y + t), (x - t, y\n- t) of the plane. Initially, at time t = 0 all babies are points on the\nplane. The goal of the game is to find the first integer moment of time when\nthe plane contains a rectangle of a non-zero area which sides are fully\ncovered by some babies. A side may be covered by multiple babies. More\nformally, each point of each side of the rectangle should be covered by at\nleast one baby of any color. At that, you must assume that the babies are\nclosed segments, that is, they contain their endpoints. You are given the\npositions of all babies \u2014 help Inna and Dima to find the required moment of\ntime. Input The first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n,\nm \u2264 2000). Next n lines contain the coordinates of the blue babies. The i-th\nline contains integers xi, yi \u2014 a baby's coordinates. Next m lines contain the\ncoordinates of m red babies in the similar form. All coordinates of the input\ndon't exceed 10^6 in their absolute value. Note that all babies stand in\ndistinct points. Output In the single line print a single integer \u2014 the answer\nto the problem. If the rectangle never appears on the plane, print \"Poor\nSereja!\" without the quotes. Examples Input 2 2 2 2 5 5 3 7 5 1 Output 3 Input\n3 2 2 2 3 2 6 2 4 2 5 2 Output 1\n\n",
