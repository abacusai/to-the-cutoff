        "description": "Madoka's father just reached \n    1\n million subscribers on Mathub! So the\nwebsite decided to send him a personalized award \u2014 The Mathhub's Bit Button!\nThe Bit Button is a rectangular table with \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n columns\nwith \n    0\n or \n    1\n in each cell. After exploring the table Madoka found\nout that: A subrectangle \n    A\n is contained in a subrectangle \n    B\n if\nthere's no cell contained in \n    A\n but not contained in \n    B\n. Two\nsubrectangles intersect if there is a cell contained in both of them. A\nsubrectangle is called black if there's no cell with value \n    0\n inside it.\nA subrectangle is called nice if it's black and it's not contained in another\nblack subrectangle. The table is called elegant if there are no two nice\nintersecting subrectangles.For example, in the first illustration the red\nsubrectangle is nice, but in the second one it's not, because it's contained\nin the purple subrectangle. Help Madoka to determine whether the table is\nelegant. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains\na single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains two positive integers \n    n, m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 100\n). The\nnext \n    n\n lines contain strings of length \n    m\n consisting of zeros and\nones \u2014 the description of the table. It is guaranteed that the sum of the\nvalues of \n    n\n and the sum of the values of \n    m\n for all test cases do\nnot exceed \n    777\n. Output For each test case print \"YES\" if its table is\nelegant or print \"NO\" otherwise. You may print each letter in any case (for\nexample, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as positive\nanswer). Example Input 5 3 3 100 011 011 3 3 110 111 110 1 5 01111 4 5 11111\n01010 01000 01000 3 2 11 00 11 Output YES NO YES NO YES Note In the second\ntest case the table is not elegant, because the red and the purple\nsubrectangles are nice and intersect. In the fourth test case the table is not\nelegant, because the red and the purple subrectangles are nice and intersect.\n\n",
