        "description": "You are given an array of integers \n    a\n of length \n    n\n. The elements of\nthe array can be either different or the same. Each element of the array is\ncolored either blue or red. There are no unpainted elements in the array. One\nof the two operations described below can be applied to an array in a single\nstep: either you can select any blue element and decrease its value by\n\n    1\n; or you can select any red element and increase its value by \n    1\n.\nSituations in which there are no elements of some color at all are also\npossible. For example, if the whole array is colored blue or red, one of the\noperations becomes unavailable. Determine whether it is possible to make\n\n    0\n or more steps such that the resulting array is a permutation of\nnumbers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n? In other words, check whether there exists a\nsequence of steps (possibly empty) such that after applying it, the array\n\n    a\n contains in some order all numbers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n\n(inclusive), each exactly once. Input The first line contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of input data sets in the\ntest. The description of each set of input data consists of three lines. The\nfirst line contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the original array \n    a\n. The second line contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n, ..., \n    a_n\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the array elements themselves. The third line has length\n\n    n\n and consists exclusively of the letters 'B' and/or 'R': \n    i\nth\ncharacter is 'B' if \n    a_i\n is colored blue, and is 'R' if colored red. It\nis guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all input sets does not exceed \n    2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output Print \n    t\n lines, each of which contains the answer\nto the corresponding test case of the input. Print YES as an answer if the\ncorresponding array can be transformed into a permutation, and NO otherwise.\nYou can print the answer in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes,\nand YES will be recognized as a positive answer). Example Input 8 4 1 2 5 2\nBRBR 2 1 1 BB 5 3 1 4 2 5 RBRRB 5 3 1 3 1 3 RBRRB 5 5 1 5 1 5 RBRRB 4 2 2 2 2\nBRBR 2 1 -2 BR 4 -2 -1 4 0 RRRR Output YES NO YES YES NO YES YES YES Note In\nthe first test case of the example, the following sequence of moves can be\nperformed: choose \n    i=3\n, element \n    a_3=5\n is blue, so we decrease it,\nwe get \n    a=[1,2,4,2]\n; choose \n    i=2\n, element \n    a_2=2\n is red, so we\nincrease it, we get \n    a=[1,3,4,2]\n; choose \n    i=3\n, element \n    a_3=4\n\nis blue, so we decrease it, we get \n    a=[1,3,3,2]\n; choose \n    i=2\n,\nelement \n    a_2=2\n is red, so we increase it, we get \n    a=[1,4,3,2]\n. We\ngot that \n    a\n is a permutation. Hence the answer is YES.\n\n",
