        "description": "You are given an integer \n    n\n. Find any string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n\nconsisting only of English lowercase letters such that each non-empty\nsubstring of \n    s\n occurs in \n    s\n an odd number of times. If there are\nmultiple such strings, output any. It can be shown that such string always\nexists under the given constraints. A string \n    a\n is a substring of a\nstring \n    b\n if \n    a\n can be obtained from \n    b\n by deletion of several\n(possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly,\nzero or all) characters from the end. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 500\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\nfirst line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoesn't exceed \n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print a single\nline containing the string \n    s\n. If there are multiple such strings, output\nany. It can be shown that such string always exists under the given\nconstraints. Example Input 4 3 5 9 19 Output abc diane bbcaabbba\nyouarethecutestuwuu Note In the first test case, each substring of \"abc\"\noccurs exactly once. In the third test case, each substring of \"bbcaabbba\"\noccurs an odd number of times. In particular, \"b\" occurs \n    5\n times, \"a\"\nand \"bb\" occur \n    3\n times each, and each of the remaining substrings occurs\nexactly once.\n\n",
