        "name": "Anton and Polyhedrons",
        "description": "Anton's favourite geometric figures are regular polyhedrons. Note that there\nare five kinds of regular polyhedrons: Tetrahedron. Tetrahedron has 4\ntriangular faces. Cube. Cube has 6 square faces. Octahedron. Octahedron has 8\ntriangular faces. Dodecahedron. Dodecahedron has 12 pentagonal faces.\nIcosahedron. Icosahedron has 20 triangular faces. All five kinds of\npolyhedrons are shown on the picture below: Anton has a collection of n\npolyhedrons. One day he decided to know, how many faces his polyhedrons have\nin total. Help Anton and find this number! Input The first line of the input\ncontains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number of polyhedrons in\nAnton's collection. Each of the following n lines of the input contains a\nstring si \u2014 the name of the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection. The string\ncan look like this: \"Tetrahedron\" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in\nAnton's collection is a tetrahedron. \"Cube\" (without quotes), if the i-th\npolyhedron in Anton's collection is a cube. \"Octahedron\" (without quotes), if\nthe i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an octahedron. \"Dodecahedron\"\n(without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a\ndodecahedron. \"Icosahedron\" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in\nAnton's collection is an icosahedron. Output Output one number \u2014 the total\nnumber of faces in all the polyhedrons in Anton's collection. Examples Input 4\nIcosahedron Cube Tetrahedron Dodecahedron Output 42 Input 3 Dodecahedron\nOctahedron Octahedron Output 28 Note In the first sample Anton has one\nicosahedron, one cube, one tetrahedron and one dodecahedron. Icosahedron has\n20 faces, cube has 6 faces, tetrahedron has 4 faces and dodecahedron has 12\nfaces. In total, they have 20 + 6 + 4 + 12 = 42 faces.\n\n",
