        "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game with strings. There will be \n    t\n rounds in\nthe game. In each round, there will be a string \n    s\n consisting of\nlowercase English letters. Alice moves first and both the players take\nalternate turns. Alice is allowed to remove any substring of even length\n(possibly empty) and Bob is allowed to remove any substring of odd length from\n\n    s\n. More formally, if there was a string \n    s = s_1s_2 \n    \u2026 s_k\n\nthe player can choose a substring \n    s_ls_l+1\n    \u2026 s_r-1s_r\n with\nlength of corresponding parity and remove it. After that the string will\nbecome \n    s = s_1 \n    \u2026 s_l-1s_r+1\n    \u2026 s_k\n. After the string\nbecomes empty, the round ends and each player calculates his/her score for\nthis round. The score of a player is the sum of values of all characters\nremoved by him/her. The value of \n    \n is \n    1\n, the value of\n\n    \n is \n    2\n, the value of \n    \n is \n    3\n,\n\n    \u2026\n, and the value of \n    \n is \n    26\n. The player\nwith higher score wins the round. For each round, determine the winner and the\ndifference between winner's and loser's scores. Assume that both players play\noptimally to maximize their score. It can be proved that a draw is impossible.\nInput The first line of input contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264\n    t\n    \u2264 5\n    \u00b7 10^4\n) denoting the number of rounds. Each of the next\n\n    t\n lines contain a single string \n    s\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 |s|\n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) consisting of lowercase English letters, denoting the string used for\nthe round. Here \n    |s|\n denotes the length of the string \n    s\n. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    |s|\n over all rounds does not exceed\n\n    2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each round, print a single line containing a\nstring and an integer. If Alice wins the round, the string must be \"Alice\". If\nBob wins the round, the string must be \"Bob\". The integer must be the\ndifference between their scores assuming both players play optimally. Example\nInput 5 aba abc cba n codeforces Output Alice 2 Alice 4 Alice 4 Bob 14 Alice\n93 Note For the first round,\n\n    \n.\nAlice's total score is \n    1+2=3\n. Bob's total score is \n    1\n. For the\nsecond round,\n\n    \n.\nAlice's total score is \n    2+3=5\n. Bob's total score is \n    1\n. For the\nthird round,\n\n    \n.\nAlice's total score is \n    3+2=5\n. Bob's total score is \n    1\n. For the\nfourth round,\n\n    \n.\nAlice's total score is \n    0\n. Bob's total score is \n    14\n. For the fifth\nround,\n\n    \n. Alice's total score is \n    3+15+4+5+6+15+18+3+5+19=93\n.\nBob's total score is \n    0\n.\n\n",
