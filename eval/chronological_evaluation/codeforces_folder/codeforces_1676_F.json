        "description": "Given an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n and an integer \n    k\n, you are\ntasked to find any two numbers \n    l\n and \n    r\n (\n    l \n    \u2264 r\n) such\nthat: For each \n    x\n \n    (l \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 r)\n, \n    x\n appears in \n    a\n\nat least \n    k\n times (i.e. \n    k\n or more array elements are equal to\n\n    x\n). The value \n    r-l\n is maximized. If no numbers satisfy the\nconditions, output -1. For example, if \n    a=[11, 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14]\n\nand \n    k=2\n, then: for \n    l=12\n, \n    r=14\n the first condition fails\nbecause \n    12\n does not appear at least \n    k=2\n times. for \n    l=13\n,\n\n    r=14\n the first condition holds, because \n    13\n occurs at least\n\n    k=2\n times in \n    a\n and \n    14\n occurs at least \n    k=2\n times in\n\n    a\n. for \n    l=11\n, \n    r=11\n the first condition holds, because\n\n    11\n occurs at least \n    k=2\n times in \n    a\n. A pair of \n    l\n and\n\n    r\n for which the first condition holds and \n    r-l\n is maximal is \n    l =\n    13\n, \n    r = 14\n. Input The first line of the input contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains\nthe integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the length of the array \n    a\n and the minimum amount\nof times each number in the range \n    [l, r]\n should appear respectively.\nThen a single line follows, containing \n    n\n integers describing the array\n\n    a\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case output \n    2\n numbers, \n    l\n and \n    r\n that satisfy the\nconditions, or \"-1\" if no numbers satisfy the conditions. If multiple answers\nexist, you can output any. Example Input 4 7 2 11 11 12 13 13 14 14 5 1 6 3 5\n2 1 6 4 4 3 4 3 3 4 14 2 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 Output 13 14 1 3 -1 1 4\n\n",
