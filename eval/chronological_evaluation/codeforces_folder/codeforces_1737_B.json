        "description": "While working at DTL, Ela is very aware of her physical and mental health. She\nstarted to practice various sports, such as Archery, Yoga, and Football. Since\nshe started engaging in sports activities, Ela switches to trying a new sport\non days she considers being \"Luxury\" days. She counts the days since she\nstarted these activities, in which the day she starts is numbered as day\n\n    1\n. A \"Luxury\" day is the day in which the number of this day is a\nluxurious number. An integer \n    x\n is called a luxurious number if it is\ndivisible by \n    \u230a\n    \u221a(x)\n    \u230b\n. Here \n    \u230a r\n    \n    \u230b\n denotes the \"floor\" of a real number \n    r\n. In other words,\nit's the largest integer not greater than \n    r\n. For example: \n    8\n,\n\n    56\n, \n    100\n are luxurious numbers, since \n    8\n is divisible by\n\n    \u230a\n    \u221a(8)\n    \u230b = \n    \u230a 2.8284 \n    \u230b = 2\n,\n\n    56\n is divisible \n    \u230a\n    \u221a(56)\n    \u230b = \n    \u230a 7.4833\n    \n    \u230b = 7\n, and \n    100\n is divisible by \n    \u230a\n    \u221a(100)\n    \u230b = \n    \u230a 10 \n    \u230b = 10\n, respectively. On the other hand\n\n    5\n, \n    40\n are not, since \n    5\n are not divisible by \n    \u230a\n    \u221a(5)\n    \u230b = \n    \u230a 2.2361 \n    \u230b = 2\n, and \n    40\n are not\ndivisible by \n    \u230a\n    \u221a(40)\n    \u230b = \n    \u230a 6.3246 \n    \u230b =\n    6\n. Being a friend of Ela, you want to engage in these fitness activities\nwith her to keep her and yourself accompanied (and have fun together, of\ncourse). Between day \n    l\n and day \n    r\n, you want to know how many times\nshe changes the activities. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The\nfirst line has the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10\n    000\n). The description of the test cases follows. The only line of each test\ncase contains two integers \n    l\n and \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264\n    10^18\n) \u2014 the intervals at which you want to know how many times Ela\nchanges her sports. Output For each test case, output an integer that denotes\nthe answer. Example Input 5 8 19 8 20 119 121 1 100000000000000000\n1234567891011 1000000000000000000 Output 5 6 2 948683296 2996666667 Note In\nthe first test case, \n    5\n luxury numbers in range \n    [8, 19]\n are: \n    8,\n    9, 12, 15, 16\n.\n\n",
