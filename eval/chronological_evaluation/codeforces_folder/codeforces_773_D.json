        "description": "In the country of Never, there are n cities and a well-developed road system.\nThere is exactly one bidirectional road between every pair of cities, thus,\nthere are as many as roads! No two roads intersect, and no road passes through\nintermediate cities. The art of building tunnels and bridges has been mastered\nby Neverians. An independent committee has evaluated each road of Never with a\npositive integer called the perishability of the road. The lower the road's\nperishability is, the more pleasant it is to drive through this road. It's the\nyear of transport in Never. It has been decided to build a museum of transport\nin one of the cities, and to set a single signpost directing to some city (not\nnecessarily the one with the museum) in each of the other cities. The\nsignposts must satisfy the following important condition: if any Neverian\nliving in a city without the museum starts travelling from that city following\nthe directions of the signposts, then this person will eventually arrive in\nthe city with the museum. Neverians are incredibly positive-minded. If a\nNeverian travels by a route consisting of several roads, he considers the\nperishability of the route to be equal to the smallest perishability of all\nthe roads in this route. The government of Never has not yet decided where to\nbuild the museum, so they consider all n possible options. The most important\nis the sum of perishabilities of the routes to the museum city from all the\nother cities of Never, if the travelers strictly follow the directions of the\nsignposts. The government of Never cares about their citizens, so they want to\nset the signposts in a way which minimizes this sum. Help them determine the\nminimum possible sum for all n possible options of the city where the museum\ncan be built. Input The first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2000)\n\u2014 the number of cities in Never. The following n - 1 lines contain the\ndescription of the road network. The i-th of these lines contains n - i\nintegers. The j-th integer in the i-th line denotes the perishability of the\nroad between cities i and i + j. All road perishabilities are between 1 and\n10^9, inclusive. Output For each city in order from 1 to n, output the minimum\npossible sum of perishabilities of the routes to this city from all the other\ncities of Never if the signposts are set in a way which minimizes this sum.\nExamples Input 3 1 2 3 Output 2 2 3 Input 6 2 9 9 6 6 7 1 9 10 9 2 5 4 10 8\nOutput 6 5 7 5 7 11 Note The first example is explained by the picture below.\nFrom left to right, there is the initial road network and the optimal\ndirections of the signposts in case the museum is built in city 1, 2 and 3,\nrespectively. The museum city is represented by a blue circle, the directions\nof the signposts are represented by green arrows. For instance, if the museum\nis built in city 3, then the signpost in city 1 must be directed to city 3,\nwhile the signpost in city 2 must be directed to city 1. Then the route from\ncity 1 to city 3 will have perishability 2, while the route from city 2 to\ncity 3 will have perishability 1. The sum of perishabilities of these routes\nis 3.\n\n",
