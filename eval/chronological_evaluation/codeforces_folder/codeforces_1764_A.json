        "description": "Doremy has \n    n\n buckets of paint which is represented by an array \n    a\n\nof length \n    n\n. Bucket \n    i\n contains paint with color \n    a_i\n. Let\n\n    c(l,r)\n be the number of distinct elements in the subarray\n\n    [a_l,a_l+1,\n    \u2026,a_r]\n. Choose \n    2\n integers \n    l\n and \n    r\n\nsuch that \n    l \n    \u2264 r\n and \n    r-l-c(l,r)\n is maximized. Input The input\nconsists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description\nof the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the array\n\n    a\n. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n). It is guaranteed that\nthe sum of \n    n\n does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case,\noutput \n    l\n and \n    r\n such that \n    l \n    \u2264 r\n and \n    r-l-c(l,r)\n is\nmaximized. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any. Example Input\n7 5 1 3 2 2 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 4 2 1 2 1 3 2 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 9 9 8 5 2 1 1 2 3 3\nOutput 2 4 1 5 1 4 2 3 1 2 1 1 3 9 Note In the first test case,\n\n    a=[1,3,2,2,4]\n. When \n    l=1\n and \n    r=3\n, \n    c(l,r)=3\n (there are\n\n    3\n distinct elements in \n    [1,3,2]\n). When \n    l=2\n and \n    r=4\n,\n\n    c(l,r)=2\n (there are \n    2\n distinct elements in \n    [3,2,2]\n). It can\nbe shown that choosing \n    l=2\n and \n    r=4\n maximizes the value of\n\n    r-l-c(l,r)\n at \n    0\n. For the second test case, \n    a=[1,2,3,4,5]\n.\nWhen \n    l=1\n and \n    r=5\n, \n    c(l,r)=5\n (there are \n    5\n distinct\nelements in \n    [1,2,3,4,5]\n). When \n    l=3\n and \n    r=3\n, \n    c(l,r)=1\n\n(there is \n    1\n distinct element in \n    [3]\n). It can be shown that\nchoosing \n    l=1\n and \n    r=5\n maximizes the value of \n    r-l-c(l,r)\n at\n\n    -1\n. Choosing \n    l=3\n and \n    r=3\n is also acceptable.\n\n",
