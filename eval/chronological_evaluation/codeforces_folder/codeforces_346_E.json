        "description": "In Doodle Jump the aim is to guide a four-legged creature called \"The Doodler\"\nup a never-ending series of platforms without falling. \u2014 Wikipedia. It is a\nvery popular game and xiaodao likes it very much. One day when playing the\ngame she wondered whether there exists a platform that the doodler couldn't\nreach due to the limits of its jumping ability. Consider the following\nproblem. There are n platforms. The height of the x-th (1 \u2264 x \u2264 n) platform is\na\u00b7x mod p, where a and p are positive co-prime integers. The maximum possible\nheight of a Doodler's jump is h. That is, it can jump from height h1 to height\nh2 (h1 < h2) if h2 - h1 \u2264 h. Initially, the Doodler is on the ground, the\nheight of which is 0. The question is whether it can reach the highest\nplatform or not. For example, when a = 7, n = 4, p = 12, h = 2, the heights of\nthe platforms are 7, 2, 9, 4 as in the picture below. With the first jump the\nDoodler can jump to the platform at height 2, with the second one the Doodler\ncan jump to the platform at height 4, but then it can't jump to any of the\nhigher platforms. So, it can't reach the highest platform. User xiaodao\nthought about the problem for a long time but didn't solve it, so she asks you\nfor help. Also, she has a lot of instances of the problem. Your task is solve\nall of these instances. Input The first line contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264\n10^4) \u2014 the number of problem instances. Each of the next t lines contains\nfour integers a, n, p and h (1 \u2264 a \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 n < p \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 h \u2264 10^9).\nIt's guaranteed that a and p are co-prime. Output For each problem instance,\nif the Doodler can reach the highest platform, output \"YES\", otherwise output\n\"NO\". Examples Input 3 7 4 12 2 7 1 9 4 7 4 12 3 Output NO NO YES\n\n",
