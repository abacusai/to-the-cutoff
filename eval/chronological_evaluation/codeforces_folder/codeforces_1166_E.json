        "description": "Dora the explorer has decided to use her money after several years of juicy\nroyalties to go shopping. What better place to shop than Nlogonia? There are\n\n    n\n stores numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n in Nlogonia. The \n    i\n-th of\nthese stores offers a positive integer \n    a_i\n. Each day among the last\n\n    m\n days Dora bought a single integer from some of the stores. The same\nday, Swiper the fox bought a single integer from all the stores that Dora did\nnot buy an integer from on that day. Dora considers Swiper to be her rival,\nand she considers that she beat Swiper on day \n    i\n if and only if the least\ncommon multiple of the numbers she bought on day \n    i\n is strictly greater\nthan the least common multiple of the numbers that Swiper bought on day\n\n    i\n. The least common multiple (LCM) of a collection of integers is the\nsmallest positive integer that is divisible by all the integers in the\ncollection. However, Dora forgot the values of \n    a_i\n. Help Dora find out\nif there are positive integer values of \n    a_i\n such that she beat Swiper on\nevery day. You don't need to find what are the possible values of \n    a_i\n\nthough. Note that it is possible for some values of \n    a_i\n to coincide in a\nsolution. Input The first line contains integers \n    m\n and \n    n\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 50\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of days\nand the number of stores. After this \n    m\n lines follow, the \n    i\n-th line\nstarts with an integer \n    s_i\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 s_i \n    \u2264 n-1\n), the number of\nintegers Dora bought on day \n    i\n, followed by \n    s_i\n distinct integers,\nthe indices of the stores where Dora bought an integer on the \n    i\n-th day.\nThe indices are between \n    1\n and \n    n\n. Output Output must consist of a\nsingle line containing \"possible\" if there exist positive integers \n    a_i\n\nsuch that for each day the least common multiple of the integers bought by\nDora is strictly greater than the least common multiple of the integers bought\nby Swiper on that day. Otherwise, print \"impossible\". Note that you don't have\nto restore the integers themselves. Examples Input 2 5 3 1 2 3 3 3 4 5 Output\npossible Input 10 10 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 1 10 Output\nimpossible Note In the first sample, a possible choice for the values of the\n\n    a_i\n is \n    3, 4, 3, 5, 2\n. On the first day, Dora buys the integers\n\n    3, 4\n and \n    3\n, whose LCM is \n    12\n, while Swiper buys integers\n\n    5\n and \n    2\n, whose LCM is \n    10\n. On the second day, Dora buys \n    3,\n    5\n and \n    2\n, whose LCM is \n    30\n, and Swiper buys integers \n    3\n and\n\n    4\n, whose LCM is \n    12\n.\n\n",
