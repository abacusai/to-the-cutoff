        "name": "Fair Division",
        "description": "Alice and Bob received \n    n\n candies from their parents. Each candy weighs\neither 1 gram or 2 grams. Now they want to divide all candies among themselves\nfairly so that the total weight of Alice's candies is equal to the total\nweight of Bob's candies. Check if they can do that. Note that candies are not\nallowed to be cut in half. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test\ncases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of candies that Alice and Bob\nreceived. The next line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n \u2014 the weights of the candies. The weight of each candy is either\n\n    1\n or \n    2\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output on a\nseparate line: \"YES\", if all candies can be divided into two sets with the\nsame weight; \"NO\" otherwise. You can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for\nexample, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).\nExample Input 5 2 1 1 2 1 2 4 1 2 1 2 3 2 2 2 3 2 1 2 Output YES NO YES NO NO\nNote In the first test case, Alice and Bob can each take one candy, then both\nwill have a total weight of \n    1\n. In the second test case, any division\nwill be unfair. In the third test case, both Alice and Bob can take two\ncandies, one of weight \n    1\n and one of weight \n    2\n. In the fourth test\ncase, it is impossible to divide three identical candies between two people.\nIn the fifth test case, any division will also be unfair.\n\n",
