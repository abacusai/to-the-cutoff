Dependent on a day of the\nweek he eats certain type of food: on Mondays, Thursdays and Sundays he eats\nfish food; on Tuesdays and Saturdays he eats rabbit stew; on other days of\nweek he eats chicken stake. Polycarp plans to go on a trip and already packed\nhis backpack. His backpack contains: \n    a\n daily rations of fish food;\n\n    b\n daily rations of rabbit stew; \n    c\n daily rations of chicken stakes.\nPolycarp has to choose such day of the week to start his trip that his cat can\neat without additional food purchases as long as possible. Print the maximum\nnumber of days the cat can eat in a trip without additional food purchases, if\nPolycarp chooses the day of the week to start his trip optimally. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains three positive integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n and\n\n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b, c \n    \u2264 7\n    \u00b710^8\n) \u2014 the number of daily\nrations of fish food, rabbit stew and chicken stakes in Polycarps backpack\ncorrespondingly. Output Print the maximum number of days the cat can eat in a\ntrip without additional food purchases, if Polycarp chooses the day of the\nweek to start his trip optimally. Examples Input 2 1 1 Output 4 Input 3 2 2\nOutput 7 Input 1 100 1 Output 3 Input 30 20 10 Output 39 Note In the first\nexample the best day for start of the trip is Sunday. In this case, during\nSunday and Monday the cat will eat fish food, during Tuesday \u2014 rabbit stew and\nduring Wednesday \u2014 chicken stake. So, after four days of the trip all food\nwill be eaten. In the second example Polycarp can start his trip in any day of\nthe week. In any case there are food supplies only for one week in Polycarps\nbackpack. In the third example Polycarp can start his trip in any day,\nexcluding Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. In this case, the cat will eat three\ndifferent dishes in three days. Nevertheless that after three days of a trip\nthere will be \n    99\n portions of rabbit stew in a backpack, can cannot eat\nanything in fourth day of a trip.\n\n",
