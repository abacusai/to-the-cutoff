        "name": "Phone Numbers",
        "description": "Winters are just damn freezing cold in Nvodsk! That's why a group of n friends\nprefers to take a taxi, order a pizza and call girls. The phone numbers in the\ncity consist of three pairs of digits (for example, 12-34-56). Each friend has\na phonebook of size si (that's the number of phone numbers). We know that taxi\nnumbers consist of six identical digits (for example, 22-22-22), the numbers\nof pizza deliveries should necessarily be decreasing sequences of six\ndifferent digits (for example, 98-73-21), all other numbers are the girls'\nnumbers. You are given your friends' phone books. Calculate which friend is\nbest to go to when you are interested in each of those things (who has maximal\nnumber of phone numbers of each type). If the phone book of one person\ncontains some number two times, you should count it twice. That is, each\nnumber should be taken into consideration the number of times it occurs in the\nphone book. Input The first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the\nnumber of friends. Then follow n data blocks that describe each friend's phone\nbooks. Each block is presented in the following form: first goes the line that\ncontains integer si and string namei (0 \u2264 si \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of phone\nnumbers in the phone book of the i-th friend and the name of the i-th friend.\nThe name is a non-empty sequence of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters,\ncontaining no more than 20 characters. Next si lines contain numbers as \"XX-\nXX-XX\", where X is arbitrary digits from 0 to 9. Output In the first line\nprint the phrase \"If you want to call a taxi, you should call: \". Then print\nnames of all friends whose phone books contain maximal number of taxi phone\nnumbers. In the second line print the phrase \"If you want to order a pizza,\nyou should call: \". Then print names of all friends who have maximal number of\npizza phone numbers. In the third line print the phrase \"If you want to go to\na cafe with a wonderful girl, you should call: \". Then print names of all\nfriends who have maximal number of girls' phone numbers. Print the names in\nthe order in which they are given in the input data. Separate two consecutive\nnames with a comma and a space. Each line should end with exactly one point.\nFor clarifications concerning the output form, see sample tests. It is\nnecessary that you follow the output form strictly. Extra spaces are not\nallowed. Examples Input 4 2 Fedorov 22-22-22 98-76-54 3 Melnikov 75-19-09\n23-45-67 99-99-98 7 Rogulenko 22-22-22 11-11-11 33-33-33 44-44-44 55-55-55\n66-66-66 95-43-21 3 Kaluzhin 11-11-11 99-99-99 98-65-32 Output If you want to\ncall a taxi, you should call: Rogulenko. If you want to order a pizza, you\nshould call: Fedorov, Rogulenko, Kaluzhin. If you want to go to a cafe with a\nwonderful girl, you should call: Melnikov. Input 3 5 Gleb 66-66-66 55-55-55\n01-01-01 65-43-21 12-34-56 3 Serega 55-55-55 87-65-43 65-55-21 5 Melnik\n12-42-12 87-73-01 36-04-12 88-12-22 82-11-43 Output If you want to call a\ntaxi, you should call: Gleb. If you want to order a pizza, you should call:\nGleb, Serega. If you want to go to a cafe with a wonderful girl, you should\ncall: Melnik. Input 3 3 Kulczynski 22-22-22 65-43-21 98-12-00 4 Pachocki\n11-11-11 11-11-11 11-11-11 98-76-54 0 Smietanka Output If you want to call a\ntaxi, you should call: Pachocki. If you want to order a pizza, you should\ncall: Kulczynski, Pachocki. If you want to go to a cafe with a wonderful girl,\nyou should call: Kulczynski. Note In the first sample you are given four\nfriends. Fedorov's phone book contains one taxi number and one pizza delivery\nnumber, Melnikov's phone book only has 3 numbers of girls, Rogulenko's one has\n6 taxi numbers and one pizza delivery number, Kaluzhin's one contains 2 taxi\nnumbers and one pizza delivery number. Thus, if you need to order a taxi, you\nshould obviously call Rogulenko, if you need to order a pizza you should call\nanybody of the following: Rogulenko, Fedorov, Kaluzhin (each of them has one\nnumber). Melnikov has maximal number of phone numbers of girls.\n\n",
