        "description": "There are \n    n\n block towers in a row, where tower \n    i\n has a height of\n\n    a_i\n. You're part of a building crew, and you want to make the buildings\nlook as nice as possible. In a single day, you can perform the following\noperation: Choose two indices \n    i\n and \n    j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i, j \n    \u2264\n    n\n; \n    i \n    \u2260 j\n), and move a block from tower \n    i\n to tower \n    j\n.\nThis essentially decreases \n    a_i\n by \n    1\n and increases \n    a_j\n by\n\n    1\n. You think the ugliness of the buildings is the height difference\nbetween the tallest and shortest buildings. Formally, the ugliness is defined\nas \n    max(a)-\n    min(a)\n. What's the minimum possible ugliness you can\nachieve, after any number of days? Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then\n\n    t\n cases follow. The first line of each test case contains one integer\n\n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of buildings. The second\nline of each test case contains \n    n\n space separated integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^7\n) \u2014 the heights of the\nbuildings. Output For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum\npossible ugliness of the buildings. Example Input 3 3 10 10 10 4 3 2 1 2 5 1 2\n3 1 5 Output 0 0 1 Note In the first test case, the ugliness is already\n\n    0\n. In the second test case, you should do one operation, with \n    i =\n    1\n and \n    j = 3\n. The new heights will now be \n    [2, 2, 2, 2]\n, with an\nugliness of \n    0\n. In the third test case, you may do three operations: with\n\n    i = 3\n and \n    j = 1\n. The new array will now be \n    [2, 2, 2, 1, 5]\n,\nwith \n    i = 5\n and \n    j = 4\n. The new array will now be \n    [2, 2, 2, 2,\n    4]\n, with \n    i = 5\n and \n    j = 3\n. The new array will now be \n    [2, 2,\n    3, 2, 3]\n. The resulting ugliness is \n    1\n. It can be proven that this is\nthe minimum possible ugliness for this test.\n\n",
