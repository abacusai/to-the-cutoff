        "description": "A new innovative ticketing systems for public transport is introduced in\nBytesburg. Now there is a single travel card for all transport. To make a trip\na passenger scan his card and then he is charged according to the fare. The\nfare is constructed in the following manner. There are three types of tickets:\na ticket for one trip costs 20 byteland rubles, a ticket for 90 minutes costs\n50 byteland rubles, a ticket for one day (1440 minutes) costs 120 byteland\nrubles. Note that a ticket for x minutes activated at time t can be used for\ntrips started in time range from t to t + x - 1, inclusive. Assume that all\ntrips take exactly one minute. To simplify the choice for the passenger, the\nsystem automatically chooses the optimal tickets. After each trip starts, the\nsystem analyses all the previous trips and the current trip and chooses a set\nof tickets for these trips with a minimum total cost. Let the minimum total\ncost of tickets to cover all trips from the first to the current is a, and the\ntotal sum charged before is b. Then the system charges the passenger the sum a\n- b. You have to write a program that, for given trips made by a passenger,\ncalculates the sum the passenger is charged after each trip. Input The first\nline of input contains integer number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of trips\nmade by passenger. Each of the following n lines contains the time of trip ti\n(0 \u2264 ti \u2264 10^9), measured in minutes from the time of starting the system. All\nti are different, given in ascending order, i. e. ti + 1 > ti holds for all 1\n\u2264 i < n. Output Output n integers. For each trip, print the sum the passenger\nis charged after it. Examples Input 3 10 20 30 Output 20 20 10 Input 10 13 45\n46 60 103 115 126 150 256 516 Output 20 20 10 0 20 0 0 20 20 10 Note In the\nfirst example, the system works as follows: for the first and second trips it\nis cheaper to pay for two one-trip tickets, so each time 20 rubles is charged,\nafter the third trip the system understands that it would be cheaper to buy a\nticket for 90 minutes. This ticket costs 50 rubles, and the passenger had\nalready paid 40 rubles, so it is necessary to charge 10 rubles only.\n\n",
