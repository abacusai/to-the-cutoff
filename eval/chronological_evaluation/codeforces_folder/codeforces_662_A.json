        "description": "As you know, the game of \"Nim\" is played with n piles of stones, where the\ni-th pile initially contains ai stones. Two players alternate the turns.\nDuring a turn a player picks any non-empty pile and removes any positive\nnumber of stones from it. The one who is not able to make a move loses the\ngame. Petya and Vasya are tired of playing Nim, so they invented their own\nversion of the game and named it the \"Gambling Nim\". They have n two-sided\ncards, one side of the i-th card has number ai written on it, while the other\nside has number bi. At the beginning of the game the players put all the cards\non the table, each card only one of its sides up, and this side is chosen\nindependently and uniformly. Thus they obtain a sequence c1, c2, ..., cn,\nwhere ci is equal to ai or bi. Then they take n piles of stones, with i-th\npile containing exactly ci stones and play Nim. Petya takes the first turn.\nGiven that both players play optimally, find the probability of Petya's\nvictory. Output the answer as an irreducible fraction. Input The first line of\nthe input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 500 000) \u2014 the number of cards\nin the deck. Each of the following n lines contains the description of one\ncard, consisting of two integers ai and bi (0 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 10^18). Output Output\nthe answer as an irreducible fraction p / q. If the probability of Petya's\nvictory is 0, print 0/1. Examples Input 2 1 1 1 1 Output 0/1 Input 2 1 2 1 2\nOutput 1/2 Input 3 0 4 1 5 2 3 Output 1/1\n\n",
