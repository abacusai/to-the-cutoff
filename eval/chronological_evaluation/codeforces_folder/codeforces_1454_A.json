        "description": "You are given one integer \n    n\n (\n    n > 1\n). Recall that a permutation of\nlength \n    n\n is an array consisting of \n    n\n distinct integers from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n in arbitrary order. For example, \n    [2, 3, 1, 5, 4]\n is a\npermutation of length \n    5\n, but \n    [1, 2, 2]\n is not a permutation\n(\n    2\n appears twice in the array) and \n    [1, 3, 4]\n is also not a\npermutation (\n    n = 3\n but there is \n    4\n in the array). Your task is to\nfind a permutation \n    p\n of length \n    n\n that there is no index \n    i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) such that \n    p_i = i\n (so, for all \n    i\n from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n the condition \n    p_i \n     i\n should be satisfied). You\nhave to answer \n    t\n independent test cases. If there are several answers,\nyou can print any. It can be proven that the answer exists for each \n    n >\n    1\n. Input The first line of the input contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases\nfollow. The only line of the test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the length of the permutation you have to find. Output\nFor each test case, print \n    n\n distinct integers \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026,\n    p_n\n \u2014 a permutation that there is no index \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    n\n) such that \n    p_i = i\n (so, for all \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n the\ncondition \n    p_i \n     i\n should be satisfied). If there are several\nanswers, you can print any. It can be proven that the answer exists for each\n\n    n > 1\n. Example Input 2 2 5 Output 2 1 2 1 5 3 4\n\n",
