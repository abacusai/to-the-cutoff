        "description": "Bomboslav likes to look out of the window in his room and watch lads outside\nplaying famous shell game. The game is played by two persons: operator and\nplayer. Operator takes three similar opaque shells and places a ball beneath\none of them. Then he shuffles the shells by swapping some pairs and the player\nhas to guess the current position of the ball. Bomboslav noticed that guys are\nnot very inventive, so the operator always swaps the left shell with the\nmiddle one during odd moves (first, third, fifth, etc.) and always swaps the\nmiddle shell with the right one during even moves (second, fourth, etc.).\nLet's number shells from 0 to 2 from left to right. Thus the left shell is\nassigned number 0, the middle shell is 1 and the right shell is 2. Bomboslav\nhas missed the moment when the ball was placed beneath the shell, but he knows\nthat exactly n movements were made by the operator and the ball was under\nshell x at the end. Now he wonders, what was the initial position of the ball?\nInput The first line of the input contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^9) \u2014 the\nnumber of movements made by the operator. The second line contains a single\ninteger x (0 \u2264 x \u2264 2) \u2014 the index of the shell where the ball was found after\nn movements. Output Print one integer from 0 to 2 \u2014 the index of the shell\nwhere the ball was initially placed. Examples Input 4 2 Output 1 Input 1 1\nOutput 0 Note In the first sample, the ball was initially placed beneath the\nmiddle shell and the operator completed four movements. During the first move\noperator swapped the left shell and the middle shell. The ball is now under\nthe left shell. During the second move operator swapped the middle shell and\nthe right one. The ball is still under the left shell. During the third move\noperator swapped the left shell and the middle shell again. The ball is again\nin the middle. Finally, the operators swapped the middle shell and the right\nshell. The ball is now beneath the right shell.\n\n",
