        "description": "Gennady is one of the best child dentists in Berland. Today n children got an\nappointment with him, they lined up in front of his office. All children love\nto cry loudly at the reception at the dentist. We enumerate the children with\nintegers from 1 to n in the order they go in the line. Every child is\nassociated with the value of his cofidence pi. The children take turns one\nafter another to come into the office; each time the child that is the first\nin the line goes to the doctor. While Gennady treats the teeth of the i-th\nchild, the child is crying with the volume of vi. At that the confidence of\nthe first child in the line is reduced by the amount of vi, the second one \u2014\nby value vi - 1, and so on. The children in the queue after the vi-th child\nalmost do not hear the crying, so their confidence remains unchanged. If at\nany point in time the confidence of the j-th child is less than zero, he\nbegins to cry with the volume of dj and leaves the line, running towards the\nexit, without going to the doctor's office. At this the confidence of all the\nchildren after the j-th one in the line is reduced by the amount of dj. All\nthese events occur immediately one after the other in some order. Some cries\nmay lead to other cries, causing a chain reaction. Once in the hallway it is\nquiet, the child, who is first in the line, goes into the doctor's office.\nHelp Gennady the Dentist to determine the numbers of kids, whose teeth he will\ncure. Print their numbers in the chronological order. Input The first line of\nthe input contains a positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 4000) \u2014 the number of kids in\nthe line. Next n lines contain three integers each vi, di, pi (1 \u2264 vi, di, pi\n\u2264 10^6) \u2014 the volume of the cry in the doctor's office, the volume of the cry\nin the hall and the confidence of the i-th child. Output In the first line\nprint number k \u2014 the number of children whose teeth Gennady will cure. In the\nsecond line print k integers \u2014 the numbers of the children who will make it to\nthe end of the line in the increasing order. Examples Input 5 4 2 2 4 1 2 5 2\n4 3 3 5 5 1 2 Output 2 1 3 Input 5 4 5 1 5 3 9 4 1 2 2 1 8 4 1 9 Output 4 1 2\n4 5 Note In the first example, Gennady first treats the teeth of the first\nchild who will cry with volume 4. The confidences of the remaining children\nwill get equal to - 2, 1, 3, 1, respectively. Thus, the second child also\ncries at the volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining\nchildren will be equal to 0, 2, 0. Then the third child will go to the office,\nand cry with volume 5. The other children won't bear this, and with a loud cry\nthey will run to the exit. In the second sample, first the first child goes\ninto the office, he will cry with volume 4. The confidence of the remaining\nchildren will be equal to 5, - 1, 6, 8. Thus, the third child will cry with\nthe volume of 1 and run to the exit. The confidence of the remaining children\nwill be equal to 5, 5, 7. After that, the second child goes to the office and\ncry with the volume of 5. The confidences of the remaining children will be\nequal to 0, 3. Then the fourth child will go into the office and cry with the\nvolume of 2. Because of this the confidence of the fifth child will be 1, and\nhe will go into the office last.\n\n",
