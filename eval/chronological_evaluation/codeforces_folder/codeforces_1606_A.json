        "description": "You are given a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting of characters a\nand/or b. Let \n    AB(s)\n be the number of occurrences of\nstring ab in \n    s\n as a substring. Analogically,\n\n    BA(s)\n is the number of occurrences of ba in \n    s\n as\na substring. In one step, you can choose any index \n    i\n and replace\n\n    s_i\n with character a or b. What is the minimum number of steps you need\nto make to achieve \n    AB(s) = \n    BA(s)\n?\nReminder: The number of occurrences of string \n    d\n in \n    s\n as substring\nis the number of indices \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 |s| - |d| + 1\n) such\nthat substring \n    s_i s_i + 1\n    \u2026 s_i + |d| - 1\n is equal to\n\n    d\n. For example, \n    AB(\naabbbabaa\n    ) = 2\n since\nthere are two indices \n    i\n: \n    i = 2\n where aabbbabaa and \n    i = 6\n\nwhere aabbbabaa. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n).\nDescription of the test cases follows. The first and only line of each test\ncase contains a single string \n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 |s| \n    \u2264 100\n, where\n\n    |s|\n is the length of the string \n    s\n), consisting only of characters\na and/or b. Output For each test case, print the resulting string \n    s\n with\n\n    AB(s) = \n    BA(s)\n you'll get making the\nminimum number of steps. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nExample Input 4 b aabbbabaa abbb abbaab Output b aabbbabaa bbbb abbaaa Note In\nthe first test case, both \n    AB(s) = 0\n and\n\n    BA(s) = 0\n (there are no occurrences of ab (ba) in b),\nso can leave \n    s\n untouched. In the second test case,\n\n    AB(s) = 2\n and \n    BA(s) = 2\n, so you\ncan leave \n    s\n untouched. In the third test case, \n    AB(s)\n    = 1\n and \n    BA(s) = 0\n. For example, we can change\n\n    s_1\n to b and make both values zero. In the fourth test case,\n\n    AB(s) = 2\n and \n    BA(s) = 1\n. For\nexample, we can change \n    s_6\n to a and make both values equal to \n    1\n.\n\n",
