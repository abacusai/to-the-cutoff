        "description": "Your security guard friend recently got a new job at a new security company.\nThe company requires him to patrol an area of the city encompassing exactly N\ncity blocks, but they let him choose which blocks. That is, your friend must\nwalk the perimeter of a region whose area is exactly N blocks. Your friend is\nquite lazy and would like your help to find the shortest possible route that\nmeets the requirements. The city is laid out in a square grid pattern, and is\nlarge enough that for the sake of the problem it can be considered infinite.\nInput Input will consist of a single integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^6), the number of\ncity blocks that must be enclosed by the route. Output Print the minimum\nperimeter that can be achieved. Examples Input 4 Output 8 Input 11 Output 14\nInput 22 Output 20 Note Here are some possible shapes for the examples:\n\n",
