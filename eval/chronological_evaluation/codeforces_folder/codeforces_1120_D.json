        "description": "You are given a rooted tree with \n    n\n vertices, the root of the tree is the\nvertex \n    1\n. Each vertex has some non-negative price. A leaf of the tree is\na non-root vertex that has degree \n    1\n. Arkady and Vasily play a strange\ngame on the tree. The game consists of three stages. On the first stage Arkady\nbuys some non-empty set of vertices of the tree. On the second stage Vasily\nputs some integers into all leaves of the tree. On the third stage Arkady can\nperform several (possibly none) operations of the following kind: choose some\nvertex \n    v\n he bought on the first stage and some integer \n    x\n, and then\nadd \n    x\n to all integers in the leaves in the subtree of \n    v\n. The\ninteger \n    x\n can be positive, negative of zero. A leaf \n    a\n is in the\nsubtree of a vertex \n    b\n if and only if the simple path between \n    a\n and\nthe root goes through \n    b\n. Arkady's task is to make all integers in the\nleaves equal to zero. What is the minimum total cost \n    s\n he has to pay on\nthe first stage to guarantee his own win independently of the integers Vasily\nputs on the second stage? Also, we ask you to find all such vertices that\nthere is an optimal (i.e. with cost \n    s\n) set of vertices containing this\none such that Arkady can guarantee his own win buying this set on the first\nstage. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 200\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree. The second line\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n), where \n    c_i\n is the price of the \n    i\n-th vertex. Each of the\nnext \n    n - 1\n lines contains two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    a, b \n    \u2264 n\n), denoting an edge of the tree. Output In the first line print\ntwo integers: the minimum possible cost \n    s\n Arkady has to pay to guarantee\nhis own win, and the number of vertices \n    k\n that belong to at least one\noptimal set. In the second line print \n    k\n distinct integers in increasing\norder the indices of the vertices that belong to at least one optimal set.\nExamples Input 5 5 1 3 2 1 1 2 2 3 2 4 1 5 Output 4 3 2 4 5 Input 3 1 1 1 1 2\n1 3 Output 2 3 1 2 3 Note In the second example all sets of two vertices are\noptimal. So, each vertex is in at least one optimal set.\n\n",
