        "name": "Game with String",
        "description": "Vasya and Kolya play a game with a string, using the following rules.\nInitially, Kolya creates a string s, consisting of small English letters, and\nuniformly at random chooses an integer k from a segment [0, len(s) - 1]. He\ntells Vasya this string s, and then shifts it k letters to the left, i. e.\ncreates a new string t = sk + 1sk + 2... sns1s2... sk. Vasya does not know the\ninteger k nor the string t, but he wants to guess the integer k. To do this,\nhe asks Kolya to tell him the first letter of the new string, and then, after\nhe sees it, open one more letter on some position, which Vasya can choose.\nVasya understands, that he can't guarantee that he will win, but he wants to\nknow the probability of winning, if he plays optimally. He wants you to\ncompute this probability. Note that Vasya wants to know the value of k\nuniquely, it means, that if there are at least two cyclic shifts of s that fit\nthe information Vasya knowns, Vasya loses. Of course, at any moment of the\ngame Vasya wants to maximize the probability of his win. Input The only string\ncontains the string s of length l (3 \u2264 l \u2264 5000), consisting of small English\nletters only. Output Print the only number \u2014 the answer for the problem. You\nanswer is considered correct, if its absolute or relative error does not\nexceed 10^-6. Formally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your\nanswer is considered correct if Examples Input technocup Output\n1.000000000000000 Input tictictactac Output 0.333333333333333 Input bbaabaabbb\nOutput 0.100000000000000 Note In the first example Vasya can always open the\nsecond letter after opening the first letter, and the cyclic shift is always\ndetermined uniquely. In the second example if the first opened letter of t is\n\"t\" or \"c\", then Vasya can't guess the shift by opening only one other letter.\nOn the other hand, if the first letter is \"i\" or \"a\", then he can open the\nfourth letter and determine the shift uniquely.\n\n",
