        "name": "Grandma Laura and Apples",
        "description": "Grandma Laura came to the market to sell some apples. During the day she sold\nall the apples she had. But grandma is old, so she forgot how many apples she\nhad brought to the market. She precisely remembers she had n buyers and each\nof them bought exactly half of the apples she had at the moment of the\npurchase and also she gave a half of an apple to some of them as a gift (if\nthe number of apples at the moment of purchase was odd), until she sold all\nthe apples she had. So each buyer took some integral positive number of\napples, but maybe he didn't pay for a half of an apple (if the number of\napples at the moment of the purchase was odd). For each buyer grandma\nremembers if she gave a half of an apple as a gift or not. The cost of an\napple is p (the number p is even). Print the total money grandma should have\nat the end of the day to check if some buyers cheated her. Input The first\nline contains two integers n and p (1 \u2264 n \u2264 40, 2 \u2264 p \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of\nthe buyers and the cost of one apple. It is guaranteed that the number p is\neven. The next n lines contains the description of buyers. Each buyer is\ndescribed with the string half if he simply bought half of the apples and with\nthe string halfplus if grandma also gave him a half of an apple as a gift. It\nis guaranteed that grandma has at least one apple at the start of the day and\nshe has no apples at the end of the day. Output Print the only integer a \u2014 the\ntotal money grandma should have at the end of the day. Note that the answer\ncan be too large, so you should use 64-bit integer type to store it. In C++\nyou can use the long long integer type and in Java you can use long integer\ntype. Examples Input 2 10 half halfplus Output 15 Input 3 10 halfplus halfplus\nhalfplus Output 55 Note In the first sample at the start of the day the\ngrandma had two apples. First she sold one apple and then she sold a half of\nthe second apple and gave a half of the second apple as a present to the\nsecond buyer.\n\n",
