        "name": "Bag of mice",
        "description": "The dragon and the princess are arguing about what to do on the New Year's\nEve. The dragon suggests flying to the mountains to watch fairies dancing in\nthe moonlight, while the princess thinks they should just go to bed early.\nThey are desperate to come to an amicable agreement, so they decide to leave\nthis up to chance. They take turns drawing a mouse from a bag which initially\ncontains w white and b black mice. The person who is the first to draw a white\nmouse wins. After each mouse drawn by the dragon the rest of mice in the bag\npanic, and one of them jumps out of the bag itself (the princess draws her\nmice carefully and doesn't scare other mice). Princess draws first. What is\nthe probability of the princess winning? If there are no more mice in the bag\nand nobody has drawn a white mouse, the dragon wins. Mice which jump out of\nthe bag themselves are not considered to be drawn (do not define the winner).\nOnce a mouse has left the bag, it never returns to it. Every mouse is drawn\nfrom the bag with the same probability as every other one, and every mouse\njumps out of the bag with the same probability as every other one. Input The\nonly line of input data contains two integers w and b (0 \u2264 w, b \u2264 1000).\nOutput Output the probability of the princess winning. The answer is\nconsidered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed\n10^-9. Examples Input 1 3 Output 0.500000000 Input 5 5 Output 0.658730159 Note\nLet's go through the first sample. The probability of the princess drawing a\nwhite mouse on her first turn and winning right away is 1/4. The probability\nof the dragon drawing a black mouse and not winning on his first turn is 3/4 *\n2/3 = 1/2. After this there are two mice left in the bag \u2014 one black and one\nwhite; one of them jumps out, and the other is drawn by the princess on her\nsecond turn. If the princess' mouse is white, she wins (probability is 1/2 *\n1/2 = 1/4), otherwise nobody gets the white mouse, so according to the rule\nthe dragon wins.\n\n",
