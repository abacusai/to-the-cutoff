        "description": "You are given an unsorted permutation \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n. To sort\nthe permutation, you choose a constant \n    k\n (\n    k \n    \u2265 1\n) and do some\noperations on the permutation. In one operation, you can choose two integers\n\n    i\n, \n    j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 j < i \n    \u2264 n\n) such that \n    i - j = k\n, then\nswap \n    p_i\n and \n    p_j\n. What is the maximum value of \n    k\n that you\ncan choose to sort the given permutation? A permutation is an array consisting\nof \n    n\n distinct integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n in arbitrary order. For\nexample, \n    [2, 3, 1, 5, 4]\n is a permutation, but \n    [1, 2, 2]\n is not a\npermutation (\n    2\n appears twice in the array) and \n    [1, 3, 4]\n is also\nnot a permutation (\n    n = 3\n but there is \n    4\n in the array). An unsorted\npermutation \n    p\n is a permutation such that there is at least one position\n\n    i\n that satisfies \n    p_i \n     i\n. Input Each test contains multiple\ntest cases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). The description of the test cases follows. The first\nline of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the permutation \n    p\n. The second line of each\ntest case contains \n    n\n distinct integers \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the permutation \n    p\n. It is guaranteed that\nthe given numbers form a permutation of length \n    n\n and the given\npermutation is unsorted. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case,\noutput the maximum value of \n    k\n that you can choose to sort the given\npermutation. We can show that an answer always exists. Example Input 7 3 3 1 2\n4 3 4 1 2 7 4 2 6 7 5 3 1 9 1 6 7 4 9 2 3 8 5 6 1 5 3 4 2 6 10 3 10 5 2 9 6 7\n8 1 4 11 1 11 6 4 8 3 7 5 9 10 2 Output 1 2 3 4 3 2 3 Note In the first test\ncase, the maximum value of \n    k\n you can choose is \n    1\n. The operations\nused to sort the permutation are: Swap \n    p_2\n and \n    p_1\n (\n    2 - 1 =\n    1\n) \n    \u2192\n \n    p = [1, 3, 2]\n Swap \n    p_2\n and \n    p_3\n\n(\n    3 - 2 = 1\n) \n    \u2192\n \n    p = [1, 2, 3]\n In the second test\ncase, the maximum value of \n    k\n you can choose is \n    2\n. The operations\nused to sort the permutation are: Swap \n    p_3\n and \n    p_1\n (\n    3 - 1 =\n    2\n) \n    \u2192\n \n    p = [1, 4, 3, 2]\n Swap \n    p_4\n and \n    p_2\n\n(\n    4 - 2 = 2\n) \n    \u2192\n \n    p = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n\n",
