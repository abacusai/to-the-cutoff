        "description": "Hiking club \"Up the hill\" just returned from a walk. Now they are trying to\nremember which hills they've just walked through. It is known that there were\nN stops, all on different integer heights between 1 and N kilometers\n(inclusive) above the sea level. On the first day they've traveled from the\nfirst stop to the second stop, on the second day they've traveled from the\nsecond to the third and so on, and on the last day they've traveled from the\nstop N - 1 to the stop N and successfully finished their expedition. They are\ntrying to find out which heights were their stops located at. They have an\nentry in a travel journal specifying how many days did they travel up the\nhill, and how many days did they walk down the hill. Help them by suggesting\nsome possible stop heights satisfying numbers from the travel journal. Input\nIn the first line there is an integer non-negative number A denoting the\nnumber of days of climbing up the hill. Second line contains an integer non-\nnegative number B \u2014 the number of days of walking down the hill (A + B + 1 =\nN, 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100 000). Output Output N space-separated distinct integers from 1\nto N inclusive, denoting possible heights of the stops in order of visiting.\nExamples Input 0 1 Output 2 1 Input 2 1 Output 1 3 4 2\n\n",
