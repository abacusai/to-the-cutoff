        "description": "You are an environmental activist at heart but the reality is harsh and you\nare just a cashier in a cinema. But you can still do something! You have\n\n    n\n tickets to sell. The price of the \n    i\n-th ticket is \n    p_i\n. As a\nteller, you have a possibility to select the order in which the tickets will\nbe sold (i.e. a permutation of the tickets). You know that the cinema\nparticipates in two ecological restoration programs applying them to the order\nyou chose: The \n    x\n    %\n of the price of each the \n    a\n-th sold ticket\n(\n    a\n-th, \n    2a\n-th, \n    3a\n-th and so on) in the order you chose is\naimed for research and spreading of renewable energy sources. The \n    y\n    %\n\nof the price of each the \n    b\n-th sold ticket (\n    b\n-th, \n    2b\n-th,\n\n    3b\n-th and so on) in the order you chose is aimed for pollution\nabatement. If the ticket is in both programs then the \n    (x + y) \n    %\n are\nused for environmental activities. Also, it's known that all prices are\nmultiples of \n    100\n, so there is no need in any rounding. For example, if\nyou'd like to sell tickets with prices \n    [400, 100, 300, 200]\n and the\ncinema pays \n    10\n    %\n of each \n    2\n-nd sold ticket and \n    20\n    %\n of\neach \n    3\n-rd sold ticket, then arranging them in order \n    [100, 200, 300,\n    400]\n will lead to contribution equal to \n    100 \n    \u00b7 0 + 200 \n    \u00b7 0.1\n    + 300 \n    \u00b7 0.2 + 400 \n    \u00b7 0.1 = 120\n. But arranging them in order\n\n    [100, 300, 400, 200]\n will lead to \n    100 \n    \u00b7 0 + 300 \n    \u00b7 0.1 +\n    400 \n    \u00b7 0.2 + 200 \n    \u00b7 0.1 = 130\n. Nature can't wait, so you decided\nto change the order of tickets in such a way, so that the total contribution\nto programs will reach at least \n    k\n in minimum number of sold tickets. Or\nsay that it's impossible to do so. In other words, find the minimum number of\ntickets which are needed to be sold in order to earn at least \n    k\n. Input\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014\nthe number of independent queries. Each query consists of \n    5\n lines. The\nfirst line of each query contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of tickets. The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    100 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    p_i\n    \n     100 = 0\n) \u2014 the corresponding prices of tickets. The third line\ncontains two integers \n    x\n and \n    a\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 100\n, \n    x + y\n    \n    \u2264 100\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 a \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the parameters of the first program.\nThe fourth line contains two integers \n    y\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 y \n    \u2264\n    100\n, \n    x + y \n    \u2264 100\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 b \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the parameters of\nthe second program. The fifth line contains single integer \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    k \n    \u2264 10^14\n) \u2014 the required total contribution. It's guaranteed that\nthe total number of tickets per test doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n.\nOutput Print \n    q\n integers \u2014 one per query. For each query, print the\nminimum number of tickets you need to sell to make the total ecological\ncontribution of at least \n    k\n if you can sell tickets in any order. If the\ntotal contribution can not be achieved selling all the tickets, print\n\n    -1\n. Example Input 4 1 100 50 1 49 1 100 8 100 200 100 200 100 200 100\n100 10 2 15 3 107 3 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 50 1 50 1 3000000000 5\n200 100 100 100 100 69 5 31 2 90 Output -1 6 3 4 Note In the first query the\ntotal contribution is equal to \n    50 + 49 = 99 < 100\n, so it's impossible to\ngather enough money. In the second query you can rearrange tickets in a\nfollowing way: \n    [100, 100, 200, 200, 100, 200, 100, 100]\n and the total\ncontribution from the first \n    6\n tickets is equal to \n    100 \n    \u00b7 0 + 100\n    \n    \u00b7 0.1 + 200 \n    \u00b7 0.15 + 200 \n    \u00b7 0.1 + 100 \n    \u00b7 0 + 200 \n    \u00b7\n    0.25 = 10 + 30 + 20 + 50 = 110\n. In the third query the full price of each\nticket goes to the environmental activities. In the fourth query you can\nrearrange tickets as \n    [100, 200, 100, 100, 100]\n and the total\ncontribution from the first \n    4\n tickets is \n    100 \n    \u00b7 0 + 200 \n    \u00b7\n    0.31 + 100 \n    \u00b7 0 + 100 \n    \u00b7 0.31 = 62 + 31 = 93\n.\n\n",
