        "description": "On a beach there are \n    n\n huts in a perfect line, hut \n    1\n being at the\nleft and hut \n    i+1\n being \n    100\n meters to the right of hut \n    i\n, for\nall \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n - 1\n. In hut \n    i\n there are \n    p_i\n people.\nThere are \n    m\n ice cream sellers, also aligned in a perfect line with all\nthe huts. The \n    i\n-th ice cream seller has their shop \n    x_i\n meters to\nthe right of the first hut. All ice cream shops are at distinct locations, but\nthey may be at the same location as a hut. You want to open a new ice cream\nshop and you wonder what the best location for your shop is. You can place\nyour ice cream shop anywhere on the beach (not necessarily at an integer\ndistance from the first hut) as long as it is aligned with the huts and the\nother ice cream shops, even if there is already another ice cream shop or a\nhut at that location. You know that people would come to your shop only if it\nis strictly closer to their hut than any other ice cream shop. If every person\nliving in the huts wants to buy exactly one ice cream, what is the maximum\nnumber of ice creams that you can sell if you place the shop optimally? Input\nThe first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    200\n     000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 200\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of huts and the\nnumber of ice cream sellers. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    p_1,\n    p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of people in\neach hut. The third line contains \n    m\n integers \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026,\n    x_m\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    x_i \n     x_j\n for \n    i \n     j\n)\n\u2014 the location of each ice cream shop. Output Print the maximum number of ice\ncreams that can be sold by choosing optimally the location of the new shop.\nExamples Input 3 1 2 5 6 169 Output 7 Input 4 2 1 2 7 8 35 157 Output 15 Input\n4 1 272203905 348354708 848256926 939404176 20 Output 2136015810 Input 3 2 1 1\n1 300 99 Output 2 Note In the first sample, you can place the shop (coloured\norange in the picture below) \n    150\n meters to the right of the first hut\n(for example) so that it is the closest shop to the first two huts, which have\n\n    2\n and \n    5\n people, for a total of \n    7\n sold ice creams. In the\nsecond sample, you can place the shop \n    170\n meters to the right of the\nfirst hut (for example) so that it is the closest shop to the last two huts,\nwhich have \n    7\n and \n    8\n people, for a total of \n    15\n sold ice\ncreams.\n\n",
