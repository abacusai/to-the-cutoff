        "description": "You are at your grandparents' house and you are playing an old video game on a\nstrange console. Your controller has only two buttons and each button has a\nnumber written on it. Initially, your score is \n    0\n. The game is composed\nof \n    n\n rounds. For each \n    1\n    \u2264 i\n    \u2264 n\n, the \n    i\n-th round works\nas follows. On the screen, a symbol \n    s_i\n appears, which is either\n\n    \n (plus) or \n    \n (minus). Then you must press\none of the two buttons on the controller once. Suppose you press a button with\nthe number \n    x\n written on it: your score will increase by \n    x\n if the\nsymbol was \n    \n and will decrease by \n    x\n if the symbol was\n\n    \n. After you press the button, the round ends. After you have\nplayed all \n    n\n rounds, you win if your score is \n    0\n. Over the years,\nyour grandparents bought many different controllers, so you have \n    q\n of\nthem. The two buttons on the \n    j\n-th controller have the numbers \n    a_j\n\nand \n    b_j\n written on them. For each controller, you must compute whether\nyou can win the game playing with that controller. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of rounds. The second line contains a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n\n\u2014 where \n    s_i\n is the symbol that will appear on the screen in the\n\n    i\n-th round. It is guaranteed that \n    s\n contains only the characters\n\n    \n and \n    \n. The third line contains an integer\n\n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of controllers. The\nfollowing \n    q\n lines contain two integers \n    a_j\n and \n    b_j\n each\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_j, b_j \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the numbers on the buttons of controller\n\n    j\n. Output Output \n    q\n lines. On line \n    j\n print\n\n    \n if the game is winnable using controller \n    j\n,\notherwise print \n    \n. Examples Input 8 +-+\u2014+- 5 2 1 10 3 7 9\n10 10 5 3 Output YES NO NO NO YES Input 6 +-++\u2013 2 9 7 1 1 Output YES YES\nInput 20 +\u2014\u2013+\u2013+\u2014\u2014\u2013+- 2 1000000000 99999997 250000000 1000000000\nOutput NO YES Note In the first sample, one possible way to get score \n    0\n\nusing the first controller is by pressing the button with numnber \n    1\n in\nrounds \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    4\n, \n    5\n, \n    6\n and \n    8\n, and pressing\nthe button with number \n    2\n in rounds \n    3\n and \n    7\n. It is possible\nto show that there is no way to get a score of \n    0\n using the second\ncontroller.\n\n",
