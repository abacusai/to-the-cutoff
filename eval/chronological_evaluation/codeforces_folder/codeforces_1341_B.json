        "name": "Nastya and Door",
        "description": "On February 14 Denis decided to give Valentine to Nastya and did not come up\nwith anything better than to draw a huge red heart on the door of the length\n\n    k\n (\n    k \n    \u2265 3\n). Nastya was very confused by this present, so she\ndecided to break the door, throwing it on the mountains. Mountains are\ndescribed by a sequence of heights \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n in order from\nleft to right (\n    k \n    \u2264 n\n). It is guaranteed that neighboring heights are\nnot equal to each other (that is, \n    a_i \n     a_i+1\n for all \n    i\n from\n\n    1\n to \n    n-1\n). Peaks of mountains on the segment \n    [l,r]\n (from\n\n    l\n to \n    r\n) are called indexes \n    i\n such that \n    l < i < r\n,\n\n    a_i - 1 < a_i\n and \n    a_i > a_i + 1\n. It is worth noting that the\nboundary indexes \n    l\n and \n    r\n for the segment are not peaks. For\nexample, if \n    n=8\n and \n    a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6]\n, then the segment\n\n    [1,8]\n has only two peaks (with indexes \n    3\n and \n    6\n), and there\nare no peaks on the segment \n    [3, 6]\n. To break the door, Nastya throws it\nto a segment \n    [l,l+k-1]\n of consecutive mountains of length \n    k\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 n-k+1\n). When the door touches the peaks of the mountains, it\nbreaks into two parts, after that these parts will continue to fall in\ndifferent halves and also break into pieces when touching the peaks of the\nmountains, and so on. Formally, the number of parts that the door will break\ninto will be equal to \n    p+1\n, where \n    p\n is the number of peaks on the\nsegment \n    [l,l+k-1]\n. Nastya wants to break it into as many pieces as\npossible. Help her choose such a segment of mountains \n    [l, l+k-1]\n that\nthe number of peaks on it is maximum. If there are several optimal segments,\nNastya wants to find one for which the value \n    l\n is minimal. Formally, you\nneed to choose a segment of mountains \n    [l, l+k-1]\n that has the maximum\nnumber of peaks. Among all such segments, you need to find the segment that\nhas the minimum possible value \n    l\n. Input The first line contains an\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThen the descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test\ncase contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of mountains and the length of the door. The\nsecond line of the input data set contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10 ^ 9\n, \n    a_i \n    \u2260 a_i + 1\n)\n\u2014 the heights of mountains. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\nthe test cases will not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test\ncase, output two integers \n    t\n and \n    l\n \u2014 the maximum number of parts\nthat the door can split into, and the left border of the segment of length\n\n    k\n that the door should be reset to.

In this segment, the\nindexes \n    3\n and \n    6\n are peaks, so the answer is \n    3\n (only \n    2\n\npeaks, so the door will break into \n    3\n parts). It is not difficult to\nnotice that the mountain segments \n    [1, 6]\n and \n    [3, 8]\n are not\nsuitable since they only have a \n    1\n peak (for the first segment, the\n\n    6\n index is not a peak, and for the second segment, the \n    3\n index is\nnot a peak). In the second example, you need to select a segment of mountains\nfrom \n    2\n to \n    4\n. In this segment, the index \n    3\n is a peak, so the\nanswer is \n    2\n (only \n    1\n peak, so the door will break into \n    2\n\nparts). In the third example, you need to select a segment of mountains from\n\n    1\n to \n    4\n. In this segment, the index \n    3\n is a peak, so the\nanswer is \n    2\n (only \n    1\n peak, so the door will break into \n    2\n\nparts). You can see that on the segments \n    [2, 5]\n, \n    [4, 7]\n and \n    [5,\n    8]\n the number of peaks is also \n    1\n, but these segments have a left\nborder greater than the segment \n    [1, 4]\n, so they are not the correct\nanswer.\n\n",
