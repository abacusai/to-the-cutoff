        "description": "Vasya wants to buy a new refrigerator. He believes that a refrigerator should\nbe a rectangular parallelepiped with integer edge lengths. Vasya calculated\nthat for daily use he will need a refrigerator with volume of at least V.\nMoreover, Vasya is a minimalist by nature, so the volume should be no more\nthan V, either \u2014 why take up extra space in the apartment? Having made up his\nmind about the volume of the refrigerator, Vasya faced a new challenge \u2014 for a\nfixed volume of V the refrigerator must have the minimum surface area so that\nit is easier to clean. The volume and the surface area of a refrigerator with\nedges a, b, c are equal to V = abc and S = 2(ab + bc + ca), correspondingly.\nGiven the volume V, help Vasya find the integer lengths for the refrigerator's\nedges a, b, c so that the refrigerator's volume equals V and its surface area\nS is minimized. Input The first line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 500)\n\u2014 the number of data sets. The description of t data sets follows. Each set\nconsists of a single integer V (2 \u2264 V \u2264 10^18), given by its factorization as\nfollows. Let V = p1^a1p2^a2... pk^ak, where pi are different prime numbers and\nai are positive integer powers. Then the first line describing a data set\ncontains a single positive integer k \u2014 the number of different prime divisors\nof V. Next k lines contain prime numbers pi and their powers ai, separated by\nspaces. All pi are different, all ai > 0. Output Print t lines, on the i-th\nline print the answer to the i-th data set as four space-separated integers:\nthe minimum possible surface area S and the corresponding edge lengths a, b,\nc. If there are multiple variants of the lengths of edges that give the\nminimum area, you are allowed to print any of them. You can print the lengths\nof the fridge's edges in any order. Examples Input 3 1 2 3 1 17 1 3 3 1 2 3 5\n1 Output 24 2 2 2 70 1 1 17 148 4 6 5 Note In the first data set of the sample\nthe fridge's volume V = 2^3 = 8, and the minimum surface area will be produced\nby the edges of equal length. In the second data set the volume V = 17, and it\ncan be produced by only one set of integer lengths.\n\n",
