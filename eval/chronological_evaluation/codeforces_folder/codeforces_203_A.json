        "description": "A boy Valera registered on site Codeforces as Valera, and wrote his first\nCodeforces Round #300. He boasted to a friend Arkady about winning as much as\nx points for his first contest. But Arkady did not believe his friend's words\nand decided to check whether Valera could have shown such a result. He knows\nthat the contest number 300 was unusual because there were only two problems.\nThe contest lasted for t minutes, the minutes are numbered starting from zero.\nThe first problem had the initial cost of a points, and every minute its cost\nreduced by da points. The second problem had the initial cost of b points, and\nevery minute this cost reduced by db points. Thus, as soon as the zero minute\nof the contest is over, the first problem will cost a - da points, and the\nsecond problem will cost b - db points. It is guaranteed that at any moment of\nthe contest each problem has a non-negative cost. Arkady asks you to find out\nwhether Valera could have got exactly x points for this contest. You should\nassume that Valera could have solved any number of the offered problems. You\nshould also assume that for each problem Valera made no more than one attempt,\nbesides, he could have submitted both problems at the same minute of the\ncontest, starting with minute 0 and ending with minute number t - 1. Please\nnote that Valera can't submit a solution exactly t minutes after the start of\nthe contest or later. Input The single line of the input contains six integers\nx, t, a, b, da, db (0 \u2264 x \u2264 600; 1 \u2264 t, a, b, da, db \u2264 300) \u2014 Valera's result,\nthe contest's duration, the initial cost of the first problem, the initial\ncost of the second problem, the number of points that the first and the second\nproblem lose per minute, correspondingly. It is guaranteed that at each minute\nof the contest each problem has a non-negative cost, that is, a - i\u00b7da \u2265 0 and\nb - i\u00b7db \u2265 0 for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t - 1. Output If Valera could have earned exactly\nx points at a contest, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\nExamples Input 30 5 20 20 3 5 Output YES Input 10 4 100 5 5 1 Output NO Note\nIn the first sample Valera could have acted like this: he could have submitted\nthe first problem at minute 0 and the second problem \u2014 at minute 2. Then the\nfirst problem brings him 20 points and the second problem brings him 10\npoints, that in total gives the required 30 points.\n\n",
