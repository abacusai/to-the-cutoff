        "description": "You are given a range of positive integers from \n    l\n to \n    r\n. Find such\na pair of integers \n    (x, y)\n that \n    l \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 r\n, \n    x \n    \n    y\n and \n    x\n divides \n    y\n. If there are multiple answers, print any of\nthem. You are also asked to answer \n    T\n independent queries. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014\nthe number of queries. Each of the next \n    T\n lines contains two integers\n\n    l\n and \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 998244353\n) \u2014 inclusive\nborders of the range. It is guaranteed that testset only includes queries,\nwhich have at least one suitable pair. Output Print \n    T\n lines, each line\nshould contain the answer \u2014 two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n such that \n    l\n    \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 r\n, \n    x \n     y\n and \n    x\n divides \n    y\n. The answer\nin the \n    i\n-th line should correspond to the \n    i\n-th query from the\ninput. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
