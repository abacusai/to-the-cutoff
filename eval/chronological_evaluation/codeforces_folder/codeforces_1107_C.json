        "description": "You are playing a new famous fighting game: Kortal Mombat XII. You have to\nperform a brutality on your opponent's character. You are playing the game on\nthe new generation console so your gamepad have \n    26\n buttons. Each button\nhas a single lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' written on it. All the\nletters on buttons are pairwise distinct. You are given a sequence of hits,\nthe \n    i\n-th hit deals \n    a_i\n units of damage to the opponent's\ncharacter. To perform the \n    i\n-th hit you have to press the button\n\n    s_i\n on your gamepad. Hits are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. You know\nthat if you press some button more than \n    k\n times in a row then it'll\nbreak. You cherish your gamepad and don't want to break any of its buttons. To\nperform a brutality you have to land some of the hits of the given sequence.\nYou are allowed to skip any of them, however changing the initial order of the\nsequence is prohibited. The total damage dealt is the sum of \n    a_i\n over\nall \n    i\n for the hits which weren't skipped. Note that if you skip the hit\nthen the counter of consecutive presses the button won't reset. Your task is\nto skip some hits to deal the maximum possible total damage to the opponent's\ncharacter and not break your gamepad buttons. Input The first line of the\ninput contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of hits and the maximum number of times you can\npush the same button in a row. The second line of the input contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), where\n\n    a_i\n is the damage of the \n    i\n-th hit. The third line of the input\ncontains the string \n    s\n consisting of exactly \n    n\n lowercase Latin\nletters \u2014 the sequence of hits (each character is the letter on the button you\nneed to press to perform the corresponding hit). Output Print one integer\n\n    dmg\n \u2014 the maximum possible damage to the opponent's character you can\ndeal without breaking your gamepad buttons. Examples Input 7 3 1 5 16 18 7 2\n10 baaaaca Output 54 Input 5 5 2 4 1 3 1000 aaaaa Output 1010 Input 5 4 2 4 1\n3 1000 aaaaa Output 1009 Input 8 1 10 15 2 1 4 8 15 16 qqwweerr Output 41\nInput 6 3 14 18 9 19 2 15 cccccc Output 52 Input 2 1 10 10 qq Output 10 Note\nIn the first example you can choose hits with numbers \n    [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\nwith the total damage \n    1 + 16 + 18 + 7 + 2 + 10 = 54\n. In the second\nexample you can choose all hits so the total damage is \n    2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 1000\n    = 1010\n. In the third example you can choose all hits expect the third one\nso the total damage is \n    2 + 4 + 3 + 1000 = 1009\n. In the fourth example\nyou can choose hits with numbers \n    [2, 3, 6, 8]\n. Only this way you can\nreach the maximum total damage \n    15 + 2 + 8 + 16 = 41\n. In the fifth\nexample you can choose only hits with numbers \n    [2, 4, 6]\n with the total\ndamage \n    18 + 19 + 15 = 52\n. In the sixth example you can change either\nfirst hit or the second hit (it does not matter) with the total damage\n\n    10\n.\n\n",
