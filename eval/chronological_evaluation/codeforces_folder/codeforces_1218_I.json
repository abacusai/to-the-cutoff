        "description": "For her birthday Alice received an interesting gift from her friends \u2013 The\nLight Square. The Light Square game is played on an \n    N \n    \u00d7 N\n\nlightbulbs square board with a magical lightbulb bar of size \n    N \n    \u00d7\n    1\n that has magical properties. At the start of the game some lights on the\nsquare board and magical bar are turned on. The goal of the game is to\ntransform the starting light square board pattern into some other pattern\nusing the magical bar without rotating the square board. The magical bar works\nas follows: It can be placed on any row or column The orientation of the\nmagical lightbulb must be left to right or top to bottom for it to keep its\nmagical properties The entire bar needs to be fully placed on a board The\nlights of the magical bar never change If the light on the magical bar is the\nsame as the light of the square it is placed on it will switch the light on\nthe square board off, otherwise it will switch the light on The magical bar\ncan be used an infinite number of times Alice has a hard time transforming her\nsquare board into the pattern Bob gave her. Can you help her transform the\nboard or let her know it is impossible? If there are multiple solutions print\nany. Input The first line contains one positive integer number \n    N\n     (1\n    \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 2000)\n representing the size of the square board. The next\n\n    N\n lines are strings of length \n    N\n consisting of 1's and 0's\nrepresenting the initial state of the square board starting from the top row.\nIf the character in a string is 1 it means the light is turned on, otherwise\nit is off. The next \n    N\n lines are strings of length \n    N\n consisting of\n1's and 0's representing the desired state of the square board starting from\nthe top row that was given to Alice by Bob. The last line is one string of\nlength \n    N\n consisting of 1's and 0's representing the pattern of the\nmagical bar in a left to right order. Output Transform the instructions for\nAlice in order to transform the square board into the pattern Bob gave her.\nThe first line of the output contains an integer number \n    M\n     (0 \n    \u2264 M\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n) representing the number of times Alice will need to apply the\nmagical bar. The next \n    M\n lines are of the form \"col \n    X\n\" or \"row\n\n    X\n\", where \n    X\n is \n    0\n-based index of the matrix, meaning the\nmagical bar should be applied to either row \n    X\n or column \n    X\n. If\nthere is no solution, print only -1. In case of multiple solutions print any\ncorrect one. Examples Input 2 11 11 00 01 11 Output -1 Input 2 10 00 00 00 10\nOutput 1 row 0 Input 3 110 011 100 100 011 100 100 Output 3 row 0 col 0 col 1\nNote Example 1: It is impossible to transform square board from one format to\nanother Example 2: Magic bar can be applied on first row or column.\n\n",
