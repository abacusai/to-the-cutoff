        "description": "You are given two integers \n    l\n and \n    r\n. Let's call an integer \n    x\n\nmodest, if \n    l \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 r\n. Find a string of length \n    n\n,\nconsisting of digits, which has the largest possible number of substrings,\nwhich make a modest integer. Substring having leading zeros are not counted.\nIf there are many answers, find lexicographically smallest one. If some number\noccurs multiple times as a substring, then in the counting of the number of\nmodest substrings it is counted multiple times as well. Input The first line\ncontains one integer \n    l\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 10^800\n). The second line\ncontains one integer \n    r\n (\n    l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 10^800\n). The third line\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n     000\n). Output In the\nfirst line, print the maximum possible number of modest substrings. In the\nsecond line, print a string of length \n    n\n having exactly that number of\nmodest substrings. If there are multiple such strings, print the\nlexicographically smallest of them. Examples Input 1 10 3 Output 3 101 Input 1\n11 3 Output 5 111 Input 12345 12346 6 Output 1 012345 Note In the first\nexample, string \u00ab101\u00bb has modest substrings \u00ab1\u00bb, \u00ab10\u00bb, \u00ab1\u00bb. In the second\nexample, string \u00ab111\u00bb has modest substrings \u00ab1\u00bb (\n    3\n times) and \u00ab11\u00bb\n(\n    2\n times).\n\n",
