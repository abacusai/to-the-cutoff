        "description": "The King wants to marry off his daughter, and he wants her husband to have the\ngreatest innate luckiness possible. To find such a person he decided to hold a\nheads-or-tails tournament. If person \n    A\n with luckiness \n    x\n and person\n\n    B\n with luckiness \n    y\n play heads-or-tails against each other, person\n\n    A\n wins with probability \n    x/(x+y)\n. The tournament has several\nrounds. Each round some participants are split into pairs. Each pair plays\nagainst each other, and the loser leaves the tournament. The participants are\nnumbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. During the first round, a number \n    k\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n) is selected such that \n    n-k/2\n is a power of\n\n    2\n (such \n    k\n always exists and is unique). Only participants numbered\nfrom \n    1\n to \n    k\n take part in the first round. It ensures that in all\nother rounds the number of participants is the power of \n    2\n. During other\nrounds, all the participants who still have not left the tournament take part.\nIf during some round, participants numbered \n    p_1 < \n    \u2026 < p_2m\n take\npart, then they are split into pairs in the following manner: participant\n\n    p_2i-1\n plays against participant \n    p_2i\n for each \n    i\n from\n\n    1\n to \n    m\n. The rounds are held until only one participant is left. He\nis declared the winner of the tournament and he will marry the King's\ndaughter. The princess can't wait to find out who is her future husband. She\nasked every participant to tell her his luckiness. Assuming they did not lie,\nshe wants to know the probability of each participant winning the tournament.\nAs you are the best friend of the princess, she asks you to help her. Input\nThe first line of the input contains the number of participants, \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The second line of the input contains\n\n    n\n integer numbers, \n    a_1, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n). The luckiness of the \n    i\n-th participant equals to \n    a_i\n.\nOutput Print \n    n\n numbers \n    p_i\n. The \n    i\n-th number should be the\nprobability of the \n    i\n-th participant winning the tournament. The absolute\nerror of your answer must not exceed \n    10^-9\n. Example Input 5 1 4 1 1 4\nOutput 0.026 0.3584 0.0676 0.0616 0.4864 Note Here is an example of a\ntournament bracket, showing the winning probability in each pair.\n\n",
