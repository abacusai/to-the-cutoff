        "description": "Kicker (table football) is a board game based on football, in which players\ncontrol the footballers' figures mounted on rods by using bars to get the ball\ninto the opponent's goal. When playing two on two, one player of each team\ncontrols the goalkeeper and the full-backs (plays defence), the other player\ncontrols the half-backs and forwards (plays attack). Two teams of company Q\ndecided to battle each other. Let's enumerate players from both teams by\nintegers from 1 to 4. The first and second player play in the first team, the\nthird and the fourth one play in the second team. For each of the four players\nwe know their game skills in defence and attack. The defence skill of the i-th\nplayer is ai, the attack skill is bi. Before the game, the teams determine how\nthey will play. First the players of the first team decide who will play in\nthe attack, and who will play in the defence. Then the second team players do\nthe same, based on the choice of their opponents. We will define a team's\ndefence as the defence skill of player of the team who plays defence.\nSimilarly, a team's attack is the attack skill of the player of the team who\nplays attack. We assume that one team is guaranteed to beat the other one, if\nits defence is strictly greater than the opponent's attack and its attack is\nstrictly greater than the opponent's defence. The teams of company Q know each\nother's strengths and therefore arrange their teams optimally. Identify the\nteam that is guaranteed to win (if both teams act optimally) or tell that\nthere is no such team. Input The input contain the players' description in\nfour lines. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers ai and bi (1 \u2264\nai, bi \u2264 100) \u2014 the defence and the attack skill of the i-th player,\ncorrespondingly. Output If the first team can win, print phrase \"Team 1\"\n(without the quotes), if the second team can win, print phrase \"Team 2\"\n(without the quotes). If no of the teams can definitely win, print \"Draw\"\n(without the quotes). Examples Input 1 100 100 1 99 99 99 99 Output Team 1\nInput 1 1 2 2 3 3 2 2 Output Team 2 Input 3 3 2 2 1 1 2 2 Output Draw Note Let\nconsider the first test sample. The first team can definitely win if it will\nchoose the following arrangement: the first player plays attack, the second\nplayer plays defence. Consider the second sample. The order of the choosing\nroles for players makes sense in this sample. As the members of the first team\nchoose first, the members of the second team can beat them (because they know\nthe exact defence value and attack value of the first team).\n\n",
