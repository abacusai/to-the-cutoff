        "description": "You are given a set of points on a straight line. Each point has a color\nassigned to it. For point a, its neighbors are the points which don't have any\nother points between them and a. Each point has at most two neighbors - one\nfrom the left and one from the right. You perform a sequence of operations on\nthis set of points. In one operation, you delete all points which have a\nneighbor point of a different color than the point itself. Points are deleted\nsimultaneously, i.e. first you decide which points have to be deleted and then\ndelete them. After that you can perform the next operation etc. If an\noperation would not delete any points, you can't perform it. How many\noperations will you need to perform until the next operation does not have any\npoints to delete? Input Input contains a single string of lowercase English\nletters 'a'-'z'. The letters give the points' colors in the order in which\nthey are arranged on the line: the first letter gives the color of the\nleftmost point, the second gives the color of the second point from the left\netc. The number of the points is between 1 and 10^6. Output Output one line\ncontaining an integer - the number of operations which can be performed on the\ngiven set of points until there are no more points to delete. Examples Input\naabb Output 2 Input aabcaa Output 1 Note In the first test case, the first\noperation will delete two middle points and leave points \"ab\", which will be\ndeleted with the second operation. There will be no points left to apply the\nthird operation to. In the second test case, the first operation will delete\nthe four points in the middle, leaving points \"aa\". None of them have\nneighbors of other colors, so the second operation can't be applied.\n\n",
