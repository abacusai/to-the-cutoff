        "description": "\n    n\n people live on the coordinate line, the \n    i\n-th one lives at the\npoint \n    x_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n). They want to choose a position\n\n    x_0\n to meet. The \n    i\n-th person will spend \n    |x_i - x_0|\n minutes\nto get to the meeting place. Also, the \n    i\n-th person needs \n    t_i\n\nminutes to get dressed, so in total he or she needs \n    t_i + |x_i - x_0|\n\nminutes. Here \n    |y|\n denotes the absolute value of \n    y\n. These people\nask you to find a position \n    x_0\n that minimizes the time in which all\n\n    n\n people can gather at the meeting place. Input The first line contains\na single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines. The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of people. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    x_1, x_2,\n    \n    \u2026, x_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 10^8\n) \u2014 the positions of the\npeople. The third line contains \n    n\n integers \n    t_1, t_2, \n    \u2026, t_n\n\n(\n    0 \n    \u2264 t_i \n    \u2264 10^8\n), where \n    t_i\n is the time \n    i\n-th\nperson needs to get dressed. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case,\nprint a single real number \u2014 the optimum position \n    x_0\n. It can be shown\nthat the optimal position \n    x_0\n is unique. Your answer will be considered\ncorrect if its absolute or relative error does not exceed \n    10^\u22126\n.\nFormally, let your answer be \n    a\n, the jury's answer be \n    b\n. Your\nanswer will be considered correct if \n    |a\u2212b|/max(1,|b|)\n    \u2264\n    10^\u22126\n. Example Input 7 1 0 3 2 3 1 0 0 2 1 4 0 0 3 1 2 3 0 0 0 3 1 2 3 4\n1 2 3 3 3 3 5 3 3 6 5 4 7 2 10 4 3 2 5 1 4 6 Output 0 2 2.5 2 1 3 6 Note In\nthe \n    1\n-st test case there is one person, so it is efficient to choose his\nor her position for the meeting place. Then he or she will get to it in\n\n    3\n minutes, that he or she need to get dressed. In the \n    2\n-nd test\ncase there are \n    2\n people who don't need time to get dressed. Each of them\nneeds one minute to get to position \n    2\n. In the \n    5\n-th test case the\n\n    1\n-st person needs \n    4\n minutes to get to position \n    1\n (\n    4\n\nminutes to get dressed and \n    0\n minutes on the way); the \n    2\n-nd person\nneeds \n    2\n minutes to get to position \n    1\n (\n    1\n minute to get\ndressed and \n    1\n minute on the way); the \n    3\n-rd person needs \n    4\n\nminutes to get to position \n    1\n (\n    2\n minutes to get dressed and \n    2\n\nminutes on the way).\n\n",
