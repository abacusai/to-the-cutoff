        "name": "Changing Volume",
        "description": "Bob watches TV every day. He always sets the volume of his TV to \n    b\n.\nHowever, today he is angry to find out someone has changed the volume to\n\n    a\n. Of course, Bob has a remote control that can change the volume. There\nare six buttons (\n    -5, -2, -1, +1, +2, +5\n) on the control, which in one\npress can either increase or decrease the current volume by \n    1\n, \n    2\n,\nor \n    5\n. The volume can be arbitrarily large, but can never be negative. In\nother words, Bob cannot press the button if it causes the volume to be lower\nthan \n    0\n. As Bob is so angry, he wants to change the volume to \n    b\n\nusing as few button presses as possible. However, he forgets how to do such\nsimple calculations, so he asks you for help. Write a program that given\n\n    a\n and \n    b\n, finds the minimum number of presses to change the TV\nvolume from \n    a\n to \n    b\n. Input Each test contains multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains the number of test cases \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264\n    1\n     000\n). Then the descriptions of the test cases follow. Each test case\nconsists of one line containing two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264\n    a, b \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the current volume and Bob's desired volume,\nrespectively. Output For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum\nnumber of presses to change the TV volume from \n    a\n to \n    b\n. If Bob does\nnot need to change the volume (i.e. \n    a=b\n), then print \n    0\n. Example\nInput 3 4 0 5 14 3 9 Output 2 3 2 Note In the first example, Bob can press the\n\n    -2\n button twice to reach \n    0\n. Note that Bob can not press \n    -5\n\nwhen the volume is \n    4\n since it will make the volume negative. In the\nsecond example, one of the optimal ways for Bob is to press the \n    +5\n\ntwice, then press \n    -1\n once. In the last example, Bob can press the\n\n    +5\n once, then press \n    +1\n.\n\n",
