        "description": "You are given a string s. Each pair of numbers l and r that fulfill the\ncondition 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 |s|, correspond to a substring of the string s, starting\nin the position l and ending in the position r (inclusive). Let's define the\nfunction of two strings F(x, y) like this. We'll find a list of such pairs of\nnumbers for which the corresponding substrings of string x are equal to string\ny. Let's sort this list of pairs according to the pair's first number's\nincreasing. The value of function F(x, y) equals the number of non-empty\ncontinuous sequences in the list. For example: F(babbabbababbab, babb) = 6.\nThe list of pairs is as follows: (1, 4), (4, 7), (9, 12) Its continuous\nsequences are: (1, 4) (4, 7) (9, 12) (1, 4), (4, 7) (4, 7), (9, 12) (1, 4),\n(4, 7), (9, 12) Your task is to calculate for the given string s the sum F(s,\nx) for all x, that x belongs to the set of all substrings of a string s. Input\nThe only line contains the given string s, consisting only of small Latin\nletters (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 10^5). Output Print the single number \u2014 the sought sum.\nPlease do not use the \n\u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the \nExamples Input aaaa Output 20 Input abcdef Output 21 Input abacabadabacaba\nOutput 188 Note In the first sample the function values at x equal to \"a\",\n\"aa\", \"aaa\" and \"aaaa\" equal 10, 6, 3 and 1 correspondingly. In the second\nsample for any satisfying x the function value is 1.\n\n",
