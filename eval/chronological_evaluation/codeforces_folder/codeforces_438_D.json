        "description": "At the children's day, the child came to Picks's house, and messed his house\nup. Picks was angry at him. A lot of important things were lost, in particular\nthe favorite sequence of Picks. Fortunately, Picks remembers how to repair the\nsequence. Initially he should create an integer array a[1], a[2], ..., a[n].\nThen he should perform a sequence of m operations. An operation can be one of\nthe following: Print operation l, r. Picks should write down the value of .\nModulo operation l, r, x. Picks should perform assignment a[i] = a[i] mod x\nfor each i (l \u2264 i \u2264 r). Set operation k, x. Picks should set the value of a[k]\nto x (in other words perform an assignment a[k] = x). Can you help Picks to\nperform the whole sequence of operations? Input The first line of input\ncontains two integer: n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5). The second line contains n\nintegers, separated by space: a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (1 \u2264 a[i] \u2264 10^9) \u2014\ninitial value of array elements. Each of the next m lines begins with a number\ntype . If type = 1, there will be two integers more in the line: l, r (1 \u2264 l \u2264\nr \u2264 n), which correspond the operation 1. If type = 2, there will be three\nintegers more in the line: l, r, x (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 x \u2264 10^9), which\ncorrespond the operation 2. If type = 3, there will be two integers more in\nthe line: k, x (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 x \u2264 10^9), which correspond the operation 3.\nOutput For each operation 1, please print a line containing the answer. Notice\nthat the answer may exceed the 32-bit integer. Examples Input 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 2\n3 5 4 3 3 5 1 2 5 2 1 3 3 1 1 3 Output 8 5 Input 10 10 6 9 6 7 6 1 10 10 9 5 1\n3 9 2 7 10 9 2 5 10 8 1 4 7 3 3 7 2 7 9 9 1 2 4 1 6 6 1 5 9 3 1 10 Output 49\n15 23 1 9 Note Consider the first testcase: At first, a = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nAfter operation 1, a = 1, 2, 3, 0, 1. After operation 2, a = 1, 2, 5, 0,\n1. At operation 3, 2 + 5 + 0 + 1 = 8. After operation 4, a = 1, 2, 2, 0, 1.\nAt operation 5, 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n",
