        "description": "Consider a road consisting of several rows. Each row is divided into several\nrectangular tiles, and all tiles in the same row are equal. The first row\ncontains exactly one rectangular tile. Look at the picture below which shows\nhow the tiles are arranged. The road is constructed as follows: the first row\nconsists of \n    1\n tile; then \n    a_1\n rows follow; each of these rows\ncontains \n    1\n tile greater than the previous row; then \n    b_1\n rows\nfollow; each of these rows contains \n    1\n tile less than the previous row;\nthen \n    a_2\n rows follow; each of these rows contains \n    1\n tile greater\nthan the previous row; then \n    b_2\n rows follow; each of these rows contains\n\n    1\n tile less than the previous row; ... then \n    a_n\n rows follow; each\nof these rows contains \n    1\n tile greater than the previous row; then\n\n    b_n\n rows follow; each of these rows contains \n    1\n tile less than the\nprevious row. An example of the road with \n    n = 2\n, \n    a_1 = 4\n, \n    b_1 =\n    2\n, \n    a_2 = 2\n, \n    b_2 = 3\n. Rows are arranged from left to right. You\nstart from the only tile in the first row and want to reach the last row (any\ntile of it). From your current tile, you can move to any tile in the next row\nwhich touches your current tile. Calculate the number of different paths from\nthe first row to the last row. Since it can be large, print it modulo\n\n    998244353\n. Input The first line contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    n \n    \u2264 1000\n). Then \n    n\n lines follow. The \n    i\n-th of them contains\ntwo integers \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264 10^5\n;\n\n    |a_i - b_i| \n    \u2264 5\n). Additional constraint on the input: the sequence\nof \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n never results in a row with non-positive number of\ntiles. Output Print one integer \u2014 the number of paths from the first row to\nthe last row, taken modulo \n    998244353\n.
