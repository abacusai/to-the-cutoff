        "name": "Koxia and Tree",
        "description": "Imi has an undirected tree with \n    n\n vertices where edges are numbered from\n\n    1\n to \n    n-1\n. The \n    i\n-th edge connects vertices \n    u_i\n and\n\n    v_i\n. There are also \n    k\n butterflies on the tree. Initially, the\n\n    i\n-th butterfly is on vertex \n    a_i\n. All values of \n    a\n are\npairwise distinct. Koxia plays a game as follows: For \n    i = 1, 2, \n    \u2026, n\n    - 1\n, Koxia set the direction of the \n    i\n-th edge as \n    u_i \n    \u2192\n    v_i\n or \n    v_i \n    \u2192 u_i\n with equal probability. For \n    i = 1, 2,\n    \n    \u2026, n - 1\n, if a butterfly is on the initial vertex of \n    i\n-th edge\nand there is no butterfly on the terminal vertex, then this butterfly flies to\nthe terminal vertex. Note that operations are sequentially in order of \n    1,\n    2, \n    \u2026, n - 1\n instead of simultaneously. Koxia chooses two butterflies\nfrom the \n    k\n butterflies with equal probability from all possible\n\n    k(k-1)/2\n ways to select two butterflies, then she takes the\ndistance\n    ^\n    \u2020\n between the two chosen vertices as her score. Now,\nKoxia wants you to find the expected value of her score, modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353^\n. \n    ^\n    \u2020\n The distance between two\nvertices on a tree is the number of edges on the (unique) simple path between\nthem. \n    ^\n Formally, let \n    M = 998\n     244\n     353\n. It can be\nshown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction\n\n    p/q\n, where \n    p\n and \n    q\n are integers and \n    q \n    \u2261 0 \n    M\n. Output the integer equal to \n    p \n    \u00b7 q^-1\n     M\n. In other words, output such an integer \n    x\n that \n    0 \n    \u2264 x\n    < M\n and \n    x \n    \u00b7 q \n    \u2261 p \n    M\n. Input The first line\ncontains two integers \n    n\n, \n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3\n    \n    \u00b710^5\n) \u2014 the size of the tree and the number of butterflies. The\nsecond line contains \n    k\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_k\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the initial position of butterflies. It's guaranteed\nthat all positions are distinct. The \n    i\n-th line in following \n    n \u2212 1\n\nlines contains two integers \n    u_i\n, \n    v_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264\n    n\n, \n    u_i \n    \u2260 v_i\n) \u2014 the vertices the \n    i\n-th edge connects. It is\nguaranteed that the given edges form a tree. Output Output a single integer \u2014\nthe expected value of Koxia's score, modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Examples\nInput 3 2 1 3 1 2 2 3 Output 748683266 Input 5 3 3 4 5 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 Output\n831870296 Note In the first test case, the tree is shown below. Vertices\ncontaining butterflies are noted as bold. There are only \n    2\n butterflies\nso the choice of butterflies is fixed. Let's consider the following \n    4\n\ncases: Edges are \n    1 \n    \u2192 2\n and \n    2 \n    \u2192 3\n:\nbutterfly on vertex \n    1\n moves to vertex \n    2\n, but butterfly on vertex\n\n    3\n doesn't move. The distance between vertices \n    2\n and \n    3\n is\n\n    1\n. Edges are \n    1 \n    \u2192 2\n and \n    3 \n    \u2192 2\n:\nbutterfly on vertex \n    1\n moves to vertex \n    2\n, but butterfly on vertex\n\n    3\n can't move to vertex \n    2\n because it's occupied. The distance\nbetween vertices \n    2\n and \n    3\n is \n    1\n. Edges are \n    2 \n    \u2192\n    1\n and \n    2 \n    \u2192 3\n: butterflies on both vertex \n    1\n and\nvertex \n    3\n don't move. The distance between vertices \n    1\n and \n    3\n\nis \n    2\n. Edges are \n    2 \n    \u2192 1\n and \n    3 \n    \u2192 2\n:\nbutterfly on vertex \n    1\n doesn't move, but butterfly on vertex \n    3\n move\nto vertex \n    2\n. The distance between vertices \n    1\n and \n    2\n is\n\n    1\n. Therefore, the expected value of Koxia's score is \n    1+1+2+1/4 = \n    5/4\n, which is \n    748\n     683\n     266\n after\nmodulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. In the second test case, the tree is shown\nbelow. Vertices containing butterflies are noted as bold. The expected value\nof Koxia's score is \n    11/6\n, which is \n    831\n     870\n     296\n\nafter modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n.\n\n",
