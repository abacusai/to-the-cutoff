        "name": "Commentator problem",
        "description": "The Olympic Games in Bercouver are in full swing now. Here everyone has their\nown objectives: sportsmen compete for medals, and sport commentators compete\nfor more convenient positions to give a running commentary. Today the main\nsport events take place at three round stadiums, and the commentator's\nobjective is to choose the best point of observation, that is to say the point\nfrom where all the three stadiums can be observed. As all the sport\ncompetitions are of the same importance, the stadiums should be observed at\nthe same angle. If the number of points meeting the conditions is more than\none, the point with the maximum angle of observation is prefered. Would you,\nplease, help the famous Berland commentator G. Berniev to find the best point\nof observation. It should be noted, that the stadiums do not hide each other,\nthe commentator can easily see one stadium through the other. Input The input\ndata consists of three lines, each of them describes the position of one\nstadium. The lines have the format x, y, r, where (x, y) are the coordinates\nof the stadium's center ( - 10^3 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^3), and r (1 \u2264 r \u2264 10^3) is its\nradius. All the numbers in the input data are integer, stadiums do not have\ncommon points, and their centers are not on the same line. Output Print the\ncoordinates of the required point with five digits after the decimal point. If\nthere is no answer meeting the conditions, the program shouldn't print\nanything. The output data should be left blank. Examples Input 0 0 10 60 0 10\n30 30 10 Output 30.00000 0.00000\n\n",
