        "description": "Rick and his co-workers have made a new radioactive formula and a lot of bad\nguys are after them. So Rick wants to give his legacy to Morty before bad guys\ncatch them. There are n planets in their universe numbered from 1 to n. Rick\nis in planet number s (the earth) and he doesn't know where Morty is. As we\nall know, Rick owns a portal gun. With this gun he can open one-way portal\nfrom a planet he is in to any other planet (including that planet). But there\nare limits on this gun because he's still using its free trial. By default he\ncan not open any portal by this gun. There are q plans in the website that\nsells these guns. Every time you purchase a plan you can only use it once but\nyou can purchase it again if you want to use it more. Plans on the website\nhave three types: With a plan of this type you can open a portal from planet v\nto planet u. With a plan of this type you can open a portal from planet v to\nany planet with index in range [l, r]. With a plan of this type you can open a\nportal from any planet with index in range [l, r] to planet v. Rick doesn't\nknown where Morty is, but Unity is going to inform him and he wants to be\nprepared for when he finds and start his journey immediately. So for each\nplanet (including earth itself) he wants to know the minimum amount of money\nhe needs to get from earth to that planet. Input The first line of input\ncontains three integers n, q and s (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 s \u2264 n) \u2014 number of\nplanets, number of plans and index of earth respectively. The next q lines\ncontain the plans. Each line starts with a number t, type of that plan (1 \u2264 t\n\u2264 3). If t = 1 then it is followed by three integers v, u and w where w is the\ncost of that plan (1 \u2264 v, u \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 w \u2264 10^9). Otherwise it is followed by\nfour integers v, l, r and w where w is the cost of that plan (1 \u2264 v \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 l\n\u2264 r \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 w \u2264 10^9). Output In the first and only line of output print n\nintegers separated by spaces. i-th of them should be minimum money to get from\nearth to i-th planet, or - 1 if it's impossible to get to that planet.\nExamples Input 3 5 1 2 3 2 3 17 2 3 2 2 16 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 1 1 12 1 3 3 17\nOutput 0 28 12 Input 4 3 1 3 4 1 3 12 2 2 3 4 10 1 2 4 16 Output 0 -1 -1 12\nNote In the first sample testcase, Rick can purchase 4th plan once and then\n2nd plan in order to get to get to planet number 2.\n\n",
