        "description": "The stardate is 2015, and Death Stars are bigger than ever! This time, two\nrebel spies have yet again given Heidi two maps with the possible locations of\nthe Death Stars. Heidi has now received two maps with possible locations of N\nDeath Stars. She knows that each of the maps is possibly corrupted, and may\ncontain some stars that are not Death Stars. Furthermore, each of the maps was\ncreated from a different point of view. Hence, stars that are shown in one of\nthe maps are rotated and translated with respect to the other map. Now Heidi\nwants to find out which of the stars shown in both maps are actually Death\nStars, and the correspondence between the Death Stars on the two maps. Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer N (1000 \u2264 N \u2264 50000) \u2013 the\nnumber of Death Stars. The second line of the input contains an integer N1 (N\n\u2264 N1 \u2264 1.5\u00b7N) \u2013 the number of stars in the first map. The next N1 lines\nspecify the coordinates of the stars in the first map. The i-th line contains\ntwo space-separated floating-point numbers xi and yi with two decimal digits\nof precision each, representing the coordinates of the i-th star in the first\nmap. The next line of the input contains an integer N2 (N \u2264 N2 \u2264 1.5\u00b7N) \u2013 the\nnumber of stars in the second map. The next N2 lines contain locations of the\nstars in the second map, given in the same format as for the first map. Output\nYou should output exactly N lines, each containing a space-separated pair of\nintegers i1 and i2. Each such line should indicate that the star numbered i1\nin the first map corresponds to the star numbered i2 in the second map. Your\nanswer will be considered correct if over 90\nyour output are indeed correct. Note The tests are generated in the following\nway: The number of Death Stars N is pre-selected in some way. The numbers of\nstars on the first and on the second map, N1 and N2, are selected uniformly at\nrandom between 1.0 \u00d7 N and 1.5 \u00d7 N. N Death Stars are generated at random,\nwith coordinates between - 10000 and 10000. Additional N1 - N and N2 - N stars\nfor the first and for the second map respectively are generated in the same\nway. A translation vector (dx, dy) is generated, with dx and dy selected\nuniformly at random between - 10000 and 10000. Each point in the first map is\ntranslated by (dx, dy). A rotation angle \u03b8 is generated, with \u03b8 selected\nuniformly at random between 0 and 2\u03c0. Each point in the first map is rotated\nby an angle of \u03b8 around the origin. Translations and rotations for the second\nmap are generated and applied in the same way. The order of points is randomly\npermuted for both maps. The test case is saved, with each point written with\ntwo decimal digits of precision.\n\n",
