        "description": "Recently, Anton has found a set. The set consists of small English letters.\nAnton carefully wrote out all the letters from the set in one line, separated\nby a comma. He also added an opening curved bracket at the beginning of the\nline and a closing curved bracket at the end of the line. Unfortunately, from\ntime to time Anton would forget writing some letter and write it again. He\nasks you to count the total number of distinct letters in his set. Input The\nfirst and the single line contains the set of letters. The length of the line\ndoesn't exceed 1000. It is guaranteed that the line starts from an opening\ncurved bracket and ends with a closing curved bracket. Between them, small\nEnglish letters are listed, separated by a comma. Each comma is followed by a\nspace. Output Print a single number \u2014 the number of distinct letters in\nAnton's set. Examples Input a, b, c Output 3 Input b, a, b, a Output 2\nInput  Output 0\n\n",
