        "name": "Almost Increasing Subsequence",
        "description": "A sequence is almost-increasing if it does not contain three consecutive\nelements \n    x, y, z\n such that \n    x\n    \u2265 y\n    \u2265 z\n. You are given an array\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n and \n    q\n queries. Each query consists of two\nintegers \n    1\n    \u2264 l\n    \u2264 r\n    \u2264 n\n. For each query, find the length of the\nlongest almost-increasing subsequence of the subarray \n    a_l, a_l+1,\n    \n    \u2026, a_r\n. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the\ngiven sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of\nthe remaining elements. Input The first line of input contains two integers,\n\n    n\n and \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, q \n    \u2264 200\n     000\n) \u2014 the length of\nthe array \n    a\n and the number of queries. The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the\nvalues of the array \n    a\n. Each of the next \n    q\n lines contains the\ndescription of a query. Each line contains two integers \n    l\n and \n    r\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the query is about the subarray \n    a_l,\n    a_l+1, \n    \u2026, a_r\n. Output For each of the \n    q\n queries, print a line\ncontaining the length of the longest almost-increasing subsequence of the\nsubarray \n    a_l, a_l+1, \n    \u2026, a_r\n. Example Input 9 8 1 2 4 3 3 5 6 2 1\n1 3 1 4 2 5 6 6 3 7 7 8 1 8 8 8 Output 3 4 3 1 4 2 7 1 Note In the first\nquery, the subarray is \n    a_1, a_2, a_3 = [1,2,4]\n. The whole subarray is\nalmost-increasing, so the answer is \n    3\n. In the second query, the subarray\nis \n    a_1, a_2, a_3,a_4 = [1,2,4,3]\n. The whole subarray is a almost-\nincreasing, because there are no three consecutive elements such that \n    x\n    \n    \u2265 y \n    \u2265 z\n. So the answer is \n    4\n. In the third query, the\nsubarray is \n    a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 = [2, 4, 3, 3]\n. The whole subarray is not\nalmost-increasing, because the last three elements satisfy \n    4 \n    \u2265 3\n    \n    \u2265 3\n. An almost-increasing subsequence of length \n    3\n can be found\n(for example taking \n    a_2,a_3,a_5 = [2,4,3]\n ). So the answer is \n    3\n.\n\n",
