        "description": "ZS the Coder has a large tree. It can be represented as an undirected\nconnected graph of n vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges between\nthem. There is a single nonzero digit written on each edge. One day, ZS the\nCoder was bored and decided to investigate some properties of the tree. He\nchose a positive integer M, which is coprime to 10, i.e. . ZS consider an\nordered pair of distinct vertices (u, v) interesting when if he would follow\nthe shortest path from vertex u to vertex v and write down all the digits he\nencounters on his path in the same order, he will get a decimal representaion\nof an integer divisible by M. Formally, ZS consider an ordered pair of\ndistinct vertices (u, v) interesting if the following states true: Let a1 = u,\na2, ..., ak = v be the sequence of vertices on the shortest path from u to v\nin the order of encountering them; Let di (1 \u2264 i < k) be the digit written on\nthe edge between vertices ai and ai + 1; The integer is divisible by M. Help\nZS the Coder find the number of interesting pairs! Input The first line of the\ninput contains two integers, n and M (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 M \u2264 10^9, ) \u2014 the\nnumber of vertices and the number ZS has chosen respectively. The next n - 1\nlines contain three integers each. i-th of them contains ui, vi and wi,\ndenoting an edge between vertices ui and vi with digit wi written on it (0 \u2264\nui, vi < n, 1 \u2264 wi \u2264 9). Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of\ninteresting (by ZS the Coder's consideration) pairs. Examples Input 6 7 0 1 2\n4 2 4 2 0 1 3 0 9 2 5 7 Output 7 Input 5 11 1 2 3 2 0 3 3 0 3 4 3 3 Output 8\nNote In the first sample case, the interesting pairs are (0, 4), (1, 2), (1,\n5), (3, 2), (2, 5), (5, 2), (3, 5). The numbers that are formed by these pairs\nare 14, 21, 217, 91, 7, 7, 917 respectively, which are all multiples of 7.\nNote that (2, 5) and (5, 2) are considered different. In the second sample\ncase, the interesting pairs are (4, 0), (0, 4), (3, 2), (2, 3), (0, 1), (1,\n0), (4, 1), (1, 4), and 6 of these pairs give the number 33 while 2 of them\ngive the number 3333, which are all multiples of 11.\n\n",
