        "description": "You are given a tree that consists of \n    n\n nodes. You should label each of\nits \n    n-1\n edges with an integer in such way that satisfies the following\nconditions: each integer must be greater than \n    0\n; the product of all\n\n    n-1\n numbers should be equal to \n    k\n; the number of \n    1\n-s among\nall \n    n-1\n integers must be minimum possible. Let's define \n    f(u,v)\n as\nthe sum of the numbers on the simple path from node \n    u\n to node \n    v\n.\nAlso, let \n    \u2211\n    _i=1^n-1\n    \u2211\n    _j=i+1^n f(i,j)\n\nbe a distribution index of the tree. Find the maximum possible distribution\nindex you can get. Since answer can be too large, print it modulo \n    10^9 +\n    7\n. In this problem, since the number \n    k\n can be large, the result of\nthe prime factorization of \n    k\n is given instead. Input The first line\ncontains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of nodes in the tree. Each of the\nnext \n    n-1\n lines describes an edge: the \n    i\n-th line contains two\nintegers \n    u_i\n and \n    v_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    u_i \n    \n    v_i\n) \u2014 indices of vertices connected by the \n    i\n-th edge. Next line\ncontains a single integer \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 6 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of prime factors of \n    k\n. Next line contains \n    m\n prime numbers\n\n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 p_i < 6 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) such that\n\n    k = p_1 \n    \u00b7 p_2 \n    \u00b7\n    \u2026\n    \u00b7 p_m\n. It is guaranteed that\nthe sum of \n    n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed \n    10^5\n, the sum of\n\n    m\n over all test cases doesn't exceed \n    6 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n, and the given\nedges for each test cases form a tree. Output Print the maximum distribution\nindex you can get. Since answer can be too large, print it modulo\n\n    10^9+7\n.

In the second\ntest case, one of the optimal ways is on the following image: In this case,\n\n    f(1,2)=3\n, \n    f(1,3)=1\n, \n    f(1,4)=4\n, \n    f(2,3)=2\n,\n\n    f(2,4)=5\n, \n    f(3,4)=3\n, so the sum of these \n    6\n numbers is\n\n    18\n.\n\n",
