        "description": "Jzzhu has picked n apples from his big apple tree. All the apples are numbered\nfrom 1 to n. Now he wants to sell them to an apple store. Jzzhu will pack his\napples into groups and then sell them. Each group must contain two apples, and\nthe greatest common divisor of numbers of the apples in each group must be\ngreater than 1. Of course, each apple can be part of at most one group. Jzzhu\nwonders how to get the maximum possible number of groups. Can you help him?\nInput A single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), the number of the apples. Output The\nfirst line must contain a single integer m, representing the maximum number of\ngroups he can get. Each of the next m lines must contain two integers \u2014 the\nnumbers of apples in the current group. If there are several optimal answers\nyou can print any of them. Examples Input 6 Output 2 6 3 2 4 Input 9 Output 3\n9 3 2 4 6 8 Input 2 Output 0\n\n",
