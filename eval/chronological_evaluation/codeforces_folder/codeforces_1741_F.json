        "description": "Dmitry has \n    n\n segments of different colors on the coordinate axis\n\n    Ox\n. Each segment is characterized by three integers \n    l_i\n, \n    r_i\n\nand \n    c_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 10^9, 1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 n\n),\nwhere \n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n are are the coordinates of the ends of the\n\n    i\n-th segment, and \n    c_i\n is its color. Dmitry likes to find the\nminimum distances between segments. However, he considers pairs of segments of\nthe same color uninteresting. Therefore, he wants to know for each segment the\ndistance from this segment to the nearest differently colored segment. The\ndistance between two segments is the minimum of the distances between a point\nof the first segment and a point of the second segment. In particular, if the\nsegments intersect, then the distance between them is equal to \n    0\n. For\nexample, Dmitry has \n    5\n segments: The first segment intersects with the\nsecond (and these are segments of different colors), so the answers for them\nare equal to \n    0\n. For the \n    3\n-rd segment, the nearest segment of a\ndifferent color is the \n    2\n-nd segment, the distance to which is equal to\n\n    2\n. For the \n    4\n-th segment, the nearest segment of a different color\nis the \n    5\n-th segment, the distance to which is equal to \n    1\n. The\n\n    5\n-th segment lies inside the \n    2\n-nd segment (and these are segments\nof different colors), so the answers for them are equal to \n    0\n. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test. The descriptions of the test\ncases follow. The first line of description of each test case contains one\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\nsegments. The next \n    n\n lines contain descriptions of the segments. Each\nsegment is described by three integers \n    l_i\n, \n    r_i\n and \n    c_i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 10^9, 1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 coordinates of\nthe left and right ends of \n    i\n-th segment, as well as the color of this\nsegment. It is guaranteed that there are at least \n    2\n segments of\ndifferent colors. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, on a separate\nline print \n    n\n integers, where the \n    i\n-th number is equal to the\ndistance from the \n    i\n-th segment to the nearest segment of a different\ncolor.

Therefore, for segments of color \n    1\n, the answer is equal\nto the distance to the \n    3\nrd segment, and for \n    3\nrd one, the answer is\nequal to the minimum of the distances to segments of color \n    1\n. In the\nsecond test case of the first sample there are only \n    2\n segments, and for\nboth of them the answer is equal to the distance between them. In the third\ntest case of the first sample, each segment intersects at least one of its\nends with a segment of a different color, so all answers are equal to \n    0\n.\nThe fourth test case of the first sample is described in the problem\nstatement. In the fifth test case of the first sample, one segment lies\ncompletely inside the other, and for both of them the answer is \n    0\n. In\nthe sixth test case of the first sample, all segments are points of different\ncolors.\n\n",
