        "description": "There are two currencies: pebbles and beads. Initially you have \n    a\n\npebbles, \n    b\n beads. There are \n    n\n days, each day you can exchange one\ncurrency for another at some exchange rate. On day \n    i\n, you can exchange\n\n    -p_i \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 p_i\n pebbles for \n    -q_i \n    \u2264 y \n    \u2264 q_i\n\nbeads or vice versa. It's allowed not to perform an exchange at all.\nMeanwhile, if you perform an exchange, the proportion \n    x \n    \u00b7 q_i = -y\n    \n    \u00b7 p_i\n must be fulfilled. Fractional exchanges are allowed. You can\nperform no more than one such exchange in one day. The numbers of pebbles and\nbeads you have must always remain non-negative. Please solve the following\n\n    n\n problems independently: for each day \n    i\n, output the maximum\nnumber of pebbles that you can have at the end of day \n    i\n if you perform\nexchanges optimally. Input The first line of the input contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains\nthree integers \n    n\n, \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 300\n     000\n,\n\n    0 \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of days and the initial number of\npebbles and beads respectively. The second line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n integers: \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n). The third line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers: \n    q_1,\n    q_2, \n    \u2026, q_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is guaranteed that\nthe sum of \n    n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed \n    300\n     000\n. Output\nOutput \n    n\n numbers \u2014 the maximum number of pebbles at the end of each day.\nYour answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not\nexceed \n    10^-6\n. Formally, let your answer be \n    a\n, and the jury's\nanswer be \n    b\n. Your answer is accepted if and only if \n    |a\n    - b\n    |/\n    max(1, \n    |b\n    |)\n    \u2264 10^-6\n. Example Input 3\n2 6 0 2 3 4 2 3 0 6 4 2 10 2 3 10 1 10 10 33 1000 Output 6 8 4 6 9.000000\n10.33 Note In the image below you can see the solutions for the first two test\ncases. In each line there is an optimal sequence of actions for each day. In\nthe first test case, the optimal strategy for the first day is to do no action\nat all, as we can only decrease the number of pebbles. The optimal strategy\nfor the second day is at first to exchange \n    1\n pebble for \n    2\n beads,\nwhich is a correct exchange, since \n    1 \n    \u00b7 4 = 2 \n    \u00b7 2\n, and then\nto exchange \n    2\n beads for \n    3\n pebbles.\n\n",
