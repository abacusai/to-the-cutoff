        "name": "Choosing The Commander",
        "description": "As you might remember from the previous round, Vova is currently playing a\nstrategic game known as Rage of Empires. Vova managed to build a large army,\nbut forgot about the main person in the army - the commander. So he tries to\nhire a commander, and he wants to choose the person who will be respected by\nwarriors. Each warrior is represented by his personality \u2014 an integer number\npi. Each commander has two characteristics \u2014 his personality pj and leadership\nlj (both are integer numbers). Warrior i respects commander j only if ( is the\nbitwise excluding OR of x and y). Initially Vova's army is empty. There are\nthree different types of events that can happen with the army: 1 pi \u2014 one\nwarrior with personality pi joins Vova's army; 2 pi \u2014 one warrior with\npersonality pi leaves Vova's army; 3 pi li \u2014 Vova tries to hire a commander\nwith personality pi and leadership li. For each event of the third type Vova\nwants to know how many warriors (counting only those who joined the army and\nhaven't left yet) respect the commander he tries to hire. Input The first line\ncontains one integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 100000) \u2014 the number of events. Then q lines\nfollow. Each line describes the event: 1 pi (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 10^8) \u2014 one warrior with\npersonality pi joins Vova's army; 2 pi (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 10^8) \u2014 one warrior with\npersonality pi leaves Vova's army (it is guaranteed that there is at least one\nsuch warrior in Vova's army by this moment); 3 pi li (1 \u2264 pi, li \u2264 10^8) \u2014\nVova tries to hire a commander with personality pi and leadership li. There is\nat least one event of this type. Output For each event of the third type print\none integer \u2014 the number of warriors who respect the commander Vova tries to\nhire in the event. Example Input 5 1 3 1 4 3 6 3 2 4 3 6 3 Output 1 0 Note In\nthe example the army consists of two warriors with personalities 3 and 4 after\nfirst two events. Then Vova tries to hire a commander with personality 6 and\nleadership 3, and only one warrior respects him (, and 2 < 3, but , and 5 \u2265\n3). Then warrior with personality 4 leaves, and when Vova tries to hire that\ncommander again, there are no warriors who respect him.\n\n",
