        "description": "Dima loves making pictures on a piece of squared paper. And yet more than that\nDima loves the pictures that depict one of his favorite figures. A piece of\nsquared paper of size n \u00d7 m is represented by a table, consisting of n rows\nand m columns. All squares are white on blank squared paper. Dima defines a\npicture as an image on a blank piece of paper, obtained by painting some\nsquares black. The picture portrays one of Dima's favorite figures, if the\nfollowing conditions hold: The picture contains at least one painted cell; All\npainted cells form a connected set, that is, you can get from any painted cell\nto any other one (you can move from one cell to a side-adjacent one); The\nminimum number of moves needed to go from the painted cell at coordinates (x1,\ny1) to the painted cell at coordinates (x2, y2), moving only through the\ncolored cells, equals |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. Now Dima is wondering: how many\npaintings are on an n \u00d7 m piece of paper, that depict one of his favorite\nfigures? Count this number modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Input The first line\ncontains two integers n and m \u2014 the sizes of the piece of paper (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264\n150). Output In a single line print the remainder after dividing the answer to\nthe problem by number 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Examples Input 2 2 Output 13\nInput 3 4 Output 571\n\n",
