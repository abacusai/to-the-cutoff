        "description": "The Department of economic development of IT City created a model of city\ndevelopment till year 2100. To prepare report about growth perspectives it is\nrequired to get growth estimates from the model. To get the growth estimates\nit is required to solve a quadratic equation. Since the Department of economic\ndevelopment of IT City creates realistic models only, that quadratic equation\nhas a solution, moreover there are exactly two different real roots. The\ngreater of these roots corresponds to the optimistic scenario, the smaller one\ncorresponds to the pessimistic one. Help to get these estimates, first the\noptimistic, then the pessimistic one. Input The only line of the input\ncontains three integers a, b, c ( - 1000 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 1000) \u2014 the coefficients\nof ax^2 + bx + c = 0 equation. Output In the first line output the greater of\nthe equation roots, in the second line output the smaller one. Absolute or\nrelative error should not be greater than 10^-6. Examples Input 1 30 200\nOutput -10.000000000000000 -20.000000000000000\n\n",
