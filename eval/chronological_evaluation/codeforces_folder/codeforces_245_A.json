        "description": "Polycarpus is a system administrator. There are two servers under his strict\nguidance \u2014 a and b. To stay informed about the servers' performance,\nPolycarpus executes commands \"ping a\" and \"ping b\". Each ping command sends\nexactly ten packets to the server specified in the argument of the command.\nExecuting a program results in two integers x and y (x + y = 10; x, y \u2265 0).\nThese numbers mean that x packets successfully reached the corresponding\nserver through the network and y packets were lost. Today Polycarpus has\nperformed overall n ping commands during his workday. Now for each server\nPolycarpus wants to know whether the server is \"alive\" or not. Polycarpus\nthinks that the server is \"alive\", if at least half of the packets that we\nsend to this server reached it successfully along the network. Help\nPolycarpus, determine for each server, whether it is \"alive\" or not by the\ngiven commands and their results. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of commands Polycarpus has fulfilled.\nEach of the following n lines contains three integers \u2014 the description of the\ncommands. The i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers ti,\nxi, yi (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 2; xi, yi \u2265 0; xi + yi = 10). If ti = 1, then the i-th\ncommand is \"ping a\", otherwise the i-th command is \"ping b\". Numbers xi, yi\nrepresent the result of executing this command, that is, xi packets reached\nthe corresponding server successfully and yi packets were lost. It is\nguaranteed that the input has at least one \"ping a\" command and at least one\n\"ping b\" command. Output In the first line print string \"LIVE\" (without the\nquotes) if server a is \"alive\", otherwise print \"DEAD\" (without the quotes).\nIn the second line print the state of server b in the similar format. Examples\nInput 2 1 5 5 2 6 4 Output LIVE LIVE Input 3 1 0 10 2 0 10 1 10 0 Output LIVE\nDEAD Note Consider the first test case. There 10 packets were sent to server\na, 5 of them reached it. Therefore, at least half of all packets sent to this\nserver successfully reached it through the network. Overall there were 10\npackets sent to server b, 6 of them reached it. Therefore, at least half of\nall packets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network.\nConsider the second test case. There were overall 20 packages sent to server\na, 10 of them reached it. Therefore, at least half of all packets sent to this\nserver successfully reached it through the network. Overall 10 packets were\nsent to server b, 0 of them reached it. Therefore, less than half of all\npackets sent to this server successfully reached it through the network.\n\n",
