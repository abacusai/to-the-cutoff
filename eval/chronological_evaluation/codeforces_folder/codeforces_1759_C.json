        "description": "Vlad came home and found out that someone had reconfigured the old thermostat\nto the temperature of \n    a\n. The thermostat can only be set to a temperature\nfrom \n    l\n to \n    r\n inclusive, the temperature cannot change by less than\n\n    x\n. Formally, in one operation you can reconfigure the thermostat from\ntemperature \n    a\n to temperature \n    b\n if \n    |a - b| \n    \u2265 x\n and \n    l\n    \n    \u2264 b \n    \u2264 r\n. You are given \n    l\n, \n    r\n, \n    x\n, \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n. Find the minimum number of operations required to get temperature\n\n    b\n from temperature \n    a\n, or say that it is impossible. Input The\nfirst line of input data contains the single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test. The descriptions of the\ntest cases follow. The first line of each case contains three integers\n\n    l\n, \n    r\n and \n    x\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 range of temperature and minimum temperature change.\nThe second line of each case contains two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    l\n    \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 r\n) \u2014 the initial and final temperatures. Output Output\n\n    t\n numbers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case.\nIf it is impossible to achieve the temperature \n    b\n, output -1, otherwise\noutput the minimum number of operations. Example Input 10 3 5 6 3 3 0 15 5 4 5\n0 10 5 3 7 3 5 6 3 4 -10 10 11 -5 6 -3 3 4 1 0 -5 10 8 9 2 1 5 1 2 5 -1 4 3 0\n2 -6 3 6 -1 -4 Output 0 2 3 -1 1 -1 3 1 3 -1 Note In the first example, the\nthermostat is already set up correctly. In the second example, you can achieve\nthe desired temperature as follows: \n    4 \n    \u2192 10 \n    \u2192 5\n.\nIn the third example, you can achieve the desired temperature as follows: \n    3\n    \n    \u2192 8 \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 7\n. In the fourth test, it is\nimpossible to make any operation.\n\n",
