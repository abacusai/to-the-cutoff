        "description": "When he's not training for IOI, Little Alawn enjoys playing with puzzles of\nvarious types to stimulate his brain. Today, he's playing with a puzzle that\nconsists of a \n    2 \n    \u00d7 n\n grid where each row is a permutation of the\nnumbers \n    1,2,3,\n    \u2026,n\n. The goal of Little Alawn's puzzle is to make\nsure no numbers on the same column or row are the same (we'll call this state\nof the puzzle as solved), and to achieve this he is able to swap the numbers\nin any column. However, after solving the puzzle many times, Little Alawn got\nbored and began wondering about the number of possible solved configurations\nof the puzzle he could achieve from an initial solved configuration only by\nswapping numbers in a column. Unfortunately, Little Alawn got stuck while\ntrying to solve this harder problem, so he was wondering if you could help him\nwith it. Find the answer modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Input Each test contains\nmultiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). Description of the test cases follows. The first\nline of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 4\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The next two lines of each test case describe the initial\nstate of the puzzle grid. Each line will be a permutation of the numbers\n\n    1,2,3,\n    \u2026,n\n and the numbers in each column and row will be pairwise\ndistinct. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does\nnot exceed \n    4 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case output a single\ninteger, the number of possible solved configurations of the puzzle Little\nAlawn can achieve from an initial solved configuration only by swapping\nnumbers in a column. As the answer can be very large, please output it modulo\n\n    10^9+7\n. The answer for each test case should be on a separate line.\nExample Input 2 4 1 4 2 3 3 2 1 4 8 2 6 5 1 4 3 7 8 3 8 7 5 1 2 4 6 Output 2 8\nNote The two possible puzzle configurations for example \n    1\n are:\n\n    [1,4,2,3]\n in the first row and \n    [3,2,1,4]\n in the second;\n\n    [3,2,1,4]\n in the first row and \n    [1,4,2,3]\n in the second.\n\n",
