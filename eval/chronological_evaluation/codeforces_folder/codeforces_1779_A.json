        "description": "Thalia is a Legendary Grandmaster in chess. She has \n    n\n trophies in a line\nnumbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n (from left to right) and a lamp standing next\nto each of them (the lamps are numbered as the trophies). A lamp can be\ndirected either to the left or to the right, and it illuminates all trophies\nin that direction (but not the one it is next to). More formally, Thalia has a\nstring \n    s\n consisting only of characters 'L' and 'R' which represents the\nlamps' current directions. The lamp \n    i\n illuminates: trophies\n\n    1,2,\n    \u2026, i-1\n if \n    s_i\n is 'L'; trophies \n    i+1,i+2,\n    \u2026,\n    n\n if \n    s_i\n is 'R'. She can perform the following operation at most\nonce: Choose an index \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i < n\n); Swap the lamps \n    i\n\nand \n    i+1\n (without changing their directions). That is, swap \n    s_i\n\nwith \n    s_i+1\n. Thalia asked you to illuminate all her trophies (make each\ntrophy illuminated by at least one lamp), or to tell her that it is impossible\nto do so. If it is possible, you can choose to perform an operation or to do\nnothing. Notice that lamps cannot change direction, it is only allowed to swap\nadjacent ones. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n).\nThe description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains a positive integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of trophies. The second line of each test case contains a string\n\n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting only of characters 'L' and 'R' \u2014 the\n\n    i\n-th character describes the direction of the \n    i\n-th lamp. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    100\n     000\n. Output For each test case print \n    -1\n if it is impossible\nto illuminate all trophies by performing one operation (or doing nothing).\nOtherwise, print \n    0\n if you choose not to perform the operation (i.e., the\ntrophies are illuminated by the initial positioning of the lamps), or an index\n\n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i < n\n) if you choose to swap lamps \n    i\n and\n\n    i+1\n. If there are multiple answers, print any. Example Input 6 2 LL 2 LR\n2 RL 2 RR 7 LLRLLLR 7 RRLRRRL Output -1 1 0 -1 3 6 Note In the first example,\nit is possible to swap lamps \n    1\n and \n    2\n, or do nothing. In any case,\nthe string \"LL\" is obtained. Not all trophies are illuminated since trophy\n\n    2\n is not illuminated by any lamp \u2014 lamp \n    1\n illuminates nothing and\nlamp \n    2\n illuminates only the trophy \n    1\n. In the second example, it is\nnecessary to swap lamps \n    1\n and \n    2\n. The string becomes \"RL\". Trophy\n\n    1\n is illuminated by lamp \n    2\n and trophy \n    2\n is illuminated by\nlamp \n    1\n, hence it is possible to illuminate all trophies. In the third\nexample, all trophies are initially illuminated \u2014 hence, not performing any\noperation is a valid solution. In the last two examples performing swaps is\nnot necessary as all trophies are illuminated initially. But, the presented\nsolutions are also valid.\n\n",
