        "description": "Vasya plays The Elder Trolls IV: Oblivon. Oh, those creators of computer\ngames! What they do not come up with! Absolutely unique monsters have been\nadded to the The Elder Trolls IV: Oblivon. One of these monsters is Unkillable\nSlug. Why it is \"Unkillable\"? Firstly, because it can be killed with cutting\nweapon only, so lovers of two-handed amber hammers should find suitable knife\nthemselves. Secondly, it is necessary to make so many cutting strokes to\nUnkillable Slug. Extremely many. Too many! Vasya has already promoted his\ncharacter to 80-th level and in order to gain level 81 he was asked to kill\nUnkillable Slug. The monster has a very interesting shape. It looks like a\nrectangular parallelepiped with size x \u00d7 y \u00d7 z, consisting of undestructable\ncells 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1. At one stroke Vasya can cut the Slug along an imaginary grid,\ni.e. cut with a plane parallel to one of the parallelepiped side. Monster dies\nwhen amount of parts it is divided reaches some critical value. All parts of\nmonster do not fall after each cut, they remains exactly on its places. I. e.\nVasya can cut several parts with one cut. Vasya wants to know what the maximum\nnumber of pieces he can cut the Unkillable Slug into striking him at most k\ntimes. Vasya's character uses absolutely thin sword with infinite length.\nInput The first line of input contains four integer numbers x, y, z, k (1 \u2264 x,\ny, z \u2264 10^6, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9). Output Output the only number \u2014 the answer for the\nproblem. Please, do not use \nin C++. It is preffered to use cout (also you may use \n2 2 3 Output 8 Input 2 2 2 1 Output 2 Note In the first sample Vasya make 3\npairwise perpendicular cuts. He cuts monster on two parts with the first cut,\nthen he divides each part on two with the second cut, and finally he divides\neach of the 4 parts on two.\n\n",
