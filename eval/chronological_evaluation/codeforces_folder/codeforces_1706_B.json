        "description": "You have a sequence of \n    n\n colored blocks. The color of the \n    i\n-th\nblock is \n    c_i\n, an integer between \n    1\n and \n    n\n. You will place the\nblocks down in sequence on an infinite coordinate grid in the following way.\nInitially, you place block \n    1\n at \n    (0, 0)\n. For \n    2 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    n\n, if the \n    (i - 1)\n-th block is placed at position \n    (x, y)\n, then\nthe \n    i\n-th block can be placed at one of positions \n    (x + 1, y)\n, \n    (x\n    - 1, y)\n, \n    (x, y + 1)\n (but not at position \n    (x, y - 1)\n), as long\nno previous block was placed at that position. A tower is formed by \n    s\n\nblocks such that they are placed at positions \n    (x, y), (x, y + 1), \n    \u2026,\n    (x, y + s - 1)\n for some position \n    (x, y)\n and integer \n    s\n. The size\nof the tower is \n    s\n, the number of blocks in it. A tower of color \n    r\n\nis a tower such that all blocks in it have the color \n    r\n. For each color\n\n    r\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, solve the following problem independently:\nFind the maximum size of a tower of color \n    r\n that you can form by placing\ndown the blocks according to the rules. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\nfirst line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 n\n). It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output \n    n\n integers. The \n    r\n-th of\nthem should be the maximum size of an tower of color \n    r\n you can form by\nfollowing the given rules. If you cannot form any tower of color \n    r\n, the\n\n    r\n-th integer should be \n    0\n. Example Input 6 7 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 6 4 2 2\n2 4 4 1 1 5 5 4 5 3 5 6 3 3 3 1 3 3 8 1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 Output 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 3\n0 2 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 4 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 Note In the first test case,\none of the possible ways to form a tower of color \n    1\n and size \n    3\n is:\nplace block \n    1\n at position \n    (0, 0)\n; place block \n    2\n to the right\nof block \n    1\n, at position \n    (1, 0)\n; place block \n    3\n above block\n\n    2\n, at position \n    (1, 1)\n; place block \n    4\n to the left of block\n\n    3\n, at position \n    (0, 1)\n; place block \n    5\n to the left of block\n\n    4\n, at position \n    (-1, 1)\n; place block \n    6\n above block \n    5\n,\nat position \n    (-1, 2)\n; place block \n    7\n to the right of block \n    6\n,\nat position \n    (0, 2)\n. The blocks at positions \n    (0, 0)\n, \n    (0, 1)\n,\nand \n    (0, 2)\n all have color \n    1\n, forming an tower of size \n    3\n. In\nthe second test case, note that the following placement is not valid, since\nyou are not allowed to place block \n    6\n under block \n    5\n: It can be\nshown that it is impossible to form a tower of color \n    4\n and size \n    3\n.\n\n",
