        "description": "Natasha was already going to fly back to Earth when she remembered that she\nneeds to go to the Martian store to buy Martian souvenirs for her friends. It\nis known, that the Martian year lasts \n    x_max\n months, month lasts\n\n    y_max\n days, day lasts \n    z_max\n seconds. Natasha also knows that\nthis store works according to the following schedule: 2 months in a year were\nselected: \n    x_l\n and \n    x_r\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 x_l\n    \u2264 x_r\n    \u2264 x_max\n), 2\ndays in a month: \n    y_l\n and \n    y_r\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 y_l\n    \u2264 y_r\n    \u2264\n    y_max\n) and 2 seconds in a day: \n    z_l\n and \n    z_r\n (\n    1\n    \u2264\n    z_l\n    \u2264 z_r\n    \u2264 z_max\n). The store works at all such moments (month\n\n    x\n, day \n    y\n, second \n    z\n), when simultaneously \n    x_l\n    \u2264 x\n    \u2264\n    x_r\n, \n    y_l\n    \u2264 y\n    \u2264 y_r\n and \n    z_l\n    \u2264 z\n    \u2264 z_r\n.\nUnfortunately, Natasha does not know the numbers\n\n    x_l,x_r,y_l,y_r,z_l,z_r\n. One Martian told Natasha: \"I went to this store\n\n    (n+m)\n times. \n    n\n times of them it was opened, and \n    m\n times \u2014\nclosed.\" He also described his every trip to the store: the month, day, second\nof the trip and whether the store was open or closed at that moment. Natasha\ncan go to the store \n    k\n times. For each of them, determine whether the\nstore at the time of the trip is open, closed, or this information is unknown.\nInput The first line contains \n    6\n integers \n    x_max\n, \n    y_max\n,\n\n    z_max\n, \n    n\n, \n    m\n, \n    k\n (\n    1\n    \u2264\n    x_max,y_max,z_max\n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    0\n    \u2264\n    m\n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 k\n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 number of months in a year, days\nin a month, seconds in a day, times when the store (according to a Martian)\nwas opened, when it was closed and Natasha's queries. The \n    i\n-th of the\nnext \n    n\n lines contains \n    3\n integers \n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n, \n    z_i\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 x_i\n    \u2264 x_max\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 y_i\n    \u2264 y_max\n, \n    1\n    \u2264\n    z_i\n    \u2264 z_max\n) \u2014 month, day and second of \n    i\n-th time, when the\nstore, according to the Martian, was opened. The \n    i\n-th of the next\n\n    m\n lines contains \n    3\n integers \n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n, \n    z_i\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 x_i\n    \u2264 x_max\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 y_i\n    \u2264 y_max\n, \n    1\n    \u2264\n    z_i\n    \u2264 z_max\n) \u2014 month, day and second of \n    i\n-th time, when the\nstore, according to the Martian, was closed. The \n    i\n-th of the next\n\n    k\n lines contains \n    3\n integers \n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n, \n    z_i\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 x_i\n    \u2264 x_max\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 y_i\n    \u2264 y_max\n, \n    1\n    \u2264\n    z_i\n    \u2264 z_max\n) \u2014 month, day and second of \n    i\n-th Natasha's query.\nOutput If the Martian was mistaken and his information about when the store is\nopen and when it is closed is inconsistent, print a single line \"INCORRECT\"\n(without quotes). Otherwise, print the first line \"CORRECT\" (without quotes).\nNext output \n    k\n lines: in \n    i\n-th of them, output an answer to\n\n    i\n-th Natasha's query: \"OPEN\" (without quotes), if the store was opened\nat the moment of this query, \"CLOSED\" (without quotes), if it was closed, or\n\"UNKNOWN\" (without quotes), if this information can not be determined on the\nbasis of available data.

There are\n\n    10\n months in a year, \n    10\n days in a month, and \n    10\n seconds in a\nday. The store was opened in \n    3\n moments: month \n    2\n, day \n    6\n,\nsecond \n    2\n; month \n    4\n, day \n    2\n, second \n    4\n; month \n    6\n, day\n\n    4\n, second \n    6\n.The store was closed at the time: month \n    9\n, day\n\n    9\n, second \n    9\n. Queries: month \n    3\n, day \n    3\n, second \n    3\n \u2014\nopen (\"OPEN\") (since the store opens no later than month \n    2\n, day \n    2\n,\nsecond \n    2\n and closes no earlier than in month \n    6\n, day \n    6\n,\nsecond \n    6\n); month \n    10\n, day \n    10\n, second \n    10\n \u2014 closed\n(\"CLOSED\") (since it is closed even in the month \n    9\n, day \n    9\n, second\n\n    9\n); month \n    8\n, day \n    8\n, second \n    8\n \u2014 unknown (\"UNKNOWN\")\n(because the schedule in which the store is open at this moment exists, and\nthe schedule in which the store is closed at this moment exists as well).In\nthe second test case, the store was closed and opened at the same time \u2014\ncontradiction (\"INCORRECT\").\n\n",
