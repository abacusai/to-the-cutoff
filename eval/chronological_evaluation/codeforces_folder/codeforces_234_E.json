        "description": "In the autumn of this year, two Russian teams came into the group stage of the\nmost prestigious football club competition in the world \u2014 the UEFA Champions\nLeague. Now, these teams have already started to play in the group stage and\nare fighting for advancing to the playoffs. In this problem we are interested\nin the draw stage, the process of sorting teams into groups. The process of\nthe draw goes as follows (the rules that are described in this problem, are\nsomehow simplified compared to the real life). Suppose n teams will take part\nin the group stage (n is divisible by four). The teams should be divided into\ngroups of four. Let's denote the number of groups as m (). Each team has a\nrating \u2014 an integer characterizing the team's previous achievements. The teams\nare sorted by the rating's decreasing (no two teams have the same rating).\nAfter that four \"baskets\" are formed, each of which will contain m teams: the\nfirst m teams with the highest rating go to the first basket, the following m\nteams go to the second one, and so on. Then the following procedure repeats m\n- 1 times. A team is randomly taken from each basket, first from the first\nbasket, then from the second, then from the third, and at last, from the\nfourth. The taken teams form another group. After that, they are removed from\ntheir baskets. The four teams remaining in the baskets after (m - 1) such\nprocedures are performed, form the last group. In the real draw the random\nselection of teams from the basket is performed by people \u2014 as a rule, the\nwell-known players of the past. As we have none, we will use a random number\ngenerator, which is constructed as follows. Its parameters are four positive\nintegers x, a, b, c. Every time there is a call to the random number\ngenerator, it produces the following actions: calculates ; replaces parameter\nx by value y (assigns ); returns x as another random number. Operation means\ntaking the remainder after division: , . A random number generator will be\nused in the draw as follows: each time we need to randomly choose a team from\nthe basket, it will generate a random number k. The teams that yet remain in\nthe basket are considered numbered with consecutive integers from 0 to s - 1,\nin the order of decreasing rating, where s is the current size of the basket.\nThen a team number is taken from the basket. Given a list of teams and the\nparameters of the random number generator, determine the result of the draw.\nInput The first input line contains integer n (4 \u2264 n \u2264 64, n is divisible by\nfour) \u2014 the number of teams that take part in the sorting. The second line\ncontains four space-separated integers x, a, b, c (1 \u2264 x, a, b, c \u2264 1000) \u2014\nthe parameters of the random number generator. Each of the following n lines\ndescribes one team. The description consists of the name of the team and its\nrating, separated by a single space. The name of a team consists of uppercase\nand lowercase English letters and has length from 1 to 20 characters. A team's\nrating is an integer from 0 to 1000. All teams' names are distinct. All team's\nratings are also distinct. Output Print the way the teams must be sorted into\ngroups. Print the groups in the order, in which they are formed in the\nsorting. Number the groups by consecutive uppercase English letters, starting\nfrom letter 'A'. Inside each group print the teams' names one per line, in the\norder of decreasing of the teams' rating. See samples for a better\nunderstanding of the output format. Examples Input 8 1 3 1 7 Barcelona 158\nMilan 90 Spartak 46 Anderlecht 48 Celtic 32 Benfica 87 Zenit 79 Malaga 16\nOutput Group A: Barcelona Benfica Spartak Celtic Group B: Milan Zenit\nAnderlecht Malaga Note In the given sample the random number generator will be\nexecuted four times: , , , .\n\n",
