        "description": "Artsem is on vacation and wants to buy souvenirs for his two teammates. There\nare n souvenir shops along the street. In i-th shop Artsem can buy one\nsouvenir for ai dollars, and he cannot buy more than one souvenir in one shop.\nHe doesn't want to introduce envy in his team, so he wants to buy two\nsouvenirs with least possible difference in price. Artsem has visited the\nshopping street m times. For some strange reason on the i-th day only shops\nwith numbers from li to ri were operating (weird? yes it is, but have you ever\ntried to come up with a reasonable legend for a range query problem?). For\neach visit, Artsem wants to know the minimum possible difference in prices of\ntwo different souvenirs he can buy in the opened shops. In other words, for\neach Artsem's visit you should find the minimum possible value of |as - at|\nwhere li \u2264 s, t \u2264 ri, s \u2260 t. Input The first line contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n\n\u2264 10^5). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, ..., an (0 \u2264\nai \u2264 10^9). The third line contains the number of queries m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 3\u00b710^5).\nNext m lines describe the queries. i-th of these lines contains two space-\nseparated integers li and ri denoting the range of shops working on i-th day\n(1 \u2264 li < ri \u2264 n). Output Print the answer to each query in a separate line.\nExample Input 8 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 4 1 8 1 3 4 8 5 7 Output 0 1 1 3\n\n",
