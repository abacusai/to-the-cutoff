        "name": "Tokitsukaze and Permutations",
        "description": "Tokitsukaze has a permutation \n    p\n. She performed the following operation\nto \n    p\n exactly \n    k\n times: in one operation, for each \n    i\n from\n\n    1\n to \n    n - 1\n in order, if \n    p_i\n > \n    p_i+1\n, swap \n    p_i\n,\n\n    p_i+1\n. After exactly \n    k\n times of operations, Tokitsukaze got a\nnew sequence \n    a\n, obviously the sequence \n    a\n is also a permutation.\nAfter that, Tokitsukaze wrote down the value sequence \n    v\n of \n    a\n on\npaper. Denote the value sequence \n    v\n of the permutation \n    a\n of length\n\n    n\n as \n    v_i=\n    \u2211_j=1^i-1[a_i < a_j]\n, where the value of \n    [a_i\n    < a_j]\n define as if \n    a_i < a_j\n, the value is \n    1\n, otherwise is\n\n    0\n (in other words, \n    v_i\n is equal to the number of elements greater\nthan \n    a_i\n that are to the left of position \n    i\n). Then Tokitsukaze\nwent out to work. There are three naughty cats in Tokitsukaze's house. When\nshe came home, she found the paper with the value sequence \n    v\n to be\nbitten out by the cats, leaving several holes, so that the value of some\npositions could not be seen clearly. She forgot what the original permutation\n\n    p\n was. She wants to know how many different permutations \n    p\n there\nare, so that the value sequence \n    v\n of the new permutation \n    a\n after\nexactly \n    k\n operations is the same as the \n    v\n written on the paper\n(not taking into account the unclear positions). Since the answer may be too\nlarge, print it modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Input The first line contains\na single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264 k\n    \n    \u2264 n-1\n) \u2014 the length of the permutation and the exactly number of\noperations. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    v_1, v_2, \n    \u2026,\n    v_n\n (\n    -1 \n    \u2264 v_i \n    \u2264 i-1\n) \u2014 the value sequence \n    v\n. \n    v_i =\n    -1\n means the \n    i\n-th position of \n    v\n can't be seen clearly. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    10^6\n. Output For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the number of\ndifferent permutations modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Example Input 3 5 0 0 1\n2 3 4 5 2 -1 1 2 0 0 5 2 0 1 1 0 0 Output 1 6 6 Note In the first test case,\nonly permutation \n    p=[5,4,3,2,1]\n satisfies the constraint condition. In\nthe second test case, there are \n    6\n permutations satisfying the constraint\ncondition, which are: \n    [3,4,5,2,1]\n \n    \u2192\n \n    [3,4,2,1,5]\n\n\n    \u2192\n \n    [3,2,1,4,5]\n \n    [3,5,4,2,1]\n \n    \u2192\n\n\n    [3,4,2,1,5]\n \n    \u2192\n \n    [3,2,1,4,5]\n \n    [4,3,5,2,1]\n\n\n    \u2192\n \n    [3,4,2,1,5]\n \n    \u2192\n \n    [3,2,1,4,5]\n\n\n    [4,5,3,2,1]\n \n    \u2192\n \n    [4,3,2,1,5]\n \n    \u2192\n\n\n    [3,2,1,4,5]\n \n    [5,3,4,2,1]\n \n    \u2192\n \n    [3,4,2,1,5]\n\n\n    \u2192\n \n    [3,2,1,4,5]\n \n    [5,4,3,2,1]\n \n    \u2192\n\n\n    [4,3,2,1,5]\n \n    \u2192\n \n    [3,2,1,4,5]\n So after exactly\n\n    2\n times of swap they will all become \n    a=[3,2,1,4,5]\n, whose value\nsequence is \n    v=[0,1,2,0,0]\n.\n\n",
