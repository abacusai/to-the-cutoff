        "name": "Queue in the Train",
        "description": "There are \n    n\n seats in the train's car and there is exactly one passenger\noccupying every seat. The seats are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n from left\nto right. The trip is long, so each passenger will become hungry at some\nmoment of time and will go to take boiled water for his noodles. The person at\nseat \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) will decide to go for boiled water at\nminute \n    t_i\n. Tank with a boiled water is located to the left of the\n\n    1\n-st seat. In case too many passengers will go for boiled water\nsimultaneously, they will form a queue, since there can be only one passenger\nusing the tank at each particular moment of time. Each passenger uses the tank\nfor exactly \n    p\n minutes. We assume that the time it takes passengers to go\nfrom their seat to the tank is negligibly small. Nobody likes to stand in a\nqueue. So when the passenger occupying the \n    i\n-th seat wants to go for a\nboiled water, he will first take a look on all seats from \n    1\n to \n    i -\n    1\n. In case at least one of those seats is empty, he assumes that those\npeople are standing in a queue right now, so he would be better seating for\nthe time being. However, at the very first moment he observes that all seats\nwith numbers smaller than \n    i\n are busy, he will go to the tank. There is\nan unspoken rule, that in case at some moment several people can go to the\ntank, than only the leftmost of them (that is, seating on the seat with\nsmallest number) will go to the tank, while all others will wait for the next\nmoment. Your goal is to find for each passenger, when he will receive the\nboiled water for his noodles. Input The first line contains integers \n    n\n\nand \n    p\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 p \n    \u2264 10^9\n)\n\u2014 the number of people and the amount of time one person uses the tank. The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    t_1, t_2, \n    \u2026, t_n\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 t_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the moments when the corresponding passenger will\ngo for the boiled water. Output Print \n    n\n integers, where \n    i\n-th of\nthem is the time moment the passenger on \n    i\n-th seat will receive his\nboiled water. Example Input 5 314 0 310 942 628 0 Output 314 628 1256 942 1570\nNote Consider the example. At the \n    0\n-th minute there were two passengers\nwilling to go for a water, passenger \n    1\n and \n    5\n, so the first\npassenger has gone first, and returned at the \n    314\n-th minute. At this\nmoment the passenger \n    2\n was already willing to go for the water, so the\npassenger \n    2\n has gone next, and so on. In the end, \n    5\n-th passenger\nwas last to receive the boiled water.\n\n",
