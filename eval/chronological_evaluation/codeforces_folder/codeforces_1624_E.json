        "description": "Masha meets a new friend and learns his phone number \u2014 \n    s\n. She wants to\nremember it as soon as possible. The phone number \u2014 is a string of length\n\n    m\n that consists of digits from \n    0\n to \n    9\n. The phone number may\nstart with 0. Masha already knows \n    n\n phone numbers (all numbers have the\nsame length \n    m\n). It will be easier for her to remember a new number if\nthe \n    s\n is represented as segments of numbers she already knows. Each such\nsegment must be of length at least \n    2\n, otherwise there will be too many\nsegments and Masha will get confused. For example, Masha needs to remember the\nnumber: \n    s =\n '12345678' and she already knows \n    n = 4\n numbers:\n'12340219', '20215601', '56782022', '12300678'. You can represent \n    s\n as a\n\n    3\n segment: '1234' of number one, '56' of number two, and '78' of number\nthree. There are other ways to represent \n    s\n. Masha asks you for help, she\nasks you to break the string \n    s\n into segments of length \n    2\n or more\nof the numbers she already knows. If there are several possible answers, print\nany of them. Input The first line of input data contains an integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014the number of test cases. Before each test case\nthere is a blank line. Then there is a line containing integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014the number of phone numbers that\nMasha knows and the number of digits in each phone number. Then follow \n    n\n\nline, \n    i\n-th of which describes the \n    i\n-th number that Masha knows.\nThe next line contains the phone number of her new friend \n    s\n. Among the\ngiven \n    n+1\n phones, there may be duplicates (identical phones). It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n \n    \u00b7 m\n (\n    n\n multiplied by \n    m\n)\nvalues over all input test cases does not exceed \n    10^6\n. Output You need\nto print the answers to \n    t\n test cases. The first line of the answer\nshould contain one number \n    k\n, corresponding to the number of segments\ninto which you split the phone number \n    s\n. Print -1 if you cannot get such\na split. If the answer is yes, then follow \n    k\n lines containing triples of\nnumbers \n    l, r, i\n. Such triplets mean that the next \n    r-l+1\n digits of\nnumber \n    s\n are equal to a segment (substring) with boundaries \n    [l, r]\n\nof the phone under number \n    i\n. Both the phones and the digits in them are\nnumbered from \n    1\n. Note that \n    r-l+1 \n    \u2265 2\n for all \n    k\n lines.\nExample Input 5 4 8 12340219 20215601 56782022 12300678 12345678 2 3 134 126\n123 1 4 1210 1221 4 3 251 064 859 957 054 4 7 7968636 9486033 4614224 5454197\n9482268 Output 3 1 4 1 5 6 2 3 4 3 -1 2 1 2 1 2 3 1 -1 3 1 3 2 5 6 3 3 4 1\nNote The example from the statement. In the second case, it is impossible to\nrepresent by segments of known numbers of length 2 or more. In the third case,\nyou can get the segments '12' and '21' from the first phone number.\n\n",
