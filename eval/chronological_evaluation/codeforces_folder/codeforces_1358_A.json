        "name": "Park Lighting",
        "description": "Due to the coronavirus pandemic, city authorities obligated citizens to keep a\nsocial distance. The mayor of the city Semyon wants to light up Gluharniki\npark so that people could see each other even at night to keep the social\ndistance. The park is a rectangular table with \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n\ncolumns, where the cells of the table are squares, and the boundaries between\nthe cells are streets. External borders are also streets. Every street has\nlength \n    1\n. For example, park with \n    n=m=2\n has \n    12\n streets. You\nwere assigned to develop a plan for lighting the park. You can put lanterns in\nthe middle of the streets. The lamp lights two squares near it (or only one\nsquare if it stands on the border of the park). The park sizes are: \n    n=4\n,\n\n    m=5\n. The lighted squares are marked yellow. Please note that all streets\nhave length \n    1\n. Lanterns are placed in the middle of the streets. In the\npicture not all the squares are lit. Semyon wants to spend the least possible\namount of money on lighting but also wants people throughout the park to keep\na social distance. So he asks you to find the minimum number of lanterns that\nare required to light all the squares. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the\ninput. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. Each test case is a line containing two\nintegers \n    n\n, \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 park sizes. Output\nPrint \n    t\n answers to the test cases. Each answer must be a single integer\n\u2014 the minimum number of lanterns that are required to light all the squares.\nExample Input 5 1 1 1 3 2 2 3 3 5 3 Output 1 2 2 5 8 Note Possible optimal\narrangement of the lanterns for the \n    2\n-nd test case of input data\nexample: Possible optimal arrangement of the lanterns for the \n    3\n-rd test\ncase of input data example:\n\n",
