        "name": "Doremy's IQ",
        "description": "Doremy is asked to test \n    n\n contests. Contest \n    i\n can only be tested\non day \n    i\n. The difficulty of contest \n    i\n is \n    a_i\n. Initially,\nDoremy's IQ is \n    q\n. On day \n    i\n Doremy will choose whether to test\ncontest \n    i\n or not. She can only test a contest if her current IQ is\nstrictly greater than \n    0\n. If Doremy chooses to test contest \n    i\n on\nday \n    i\n, the following happens: if \n    a_i>q\n, Doremy will feel she is\nnot wise enough, so \n    q\n decreases by \n    1\n; otherwise, nothing changes.\nIf she chooses not to test a contest, nothing changes.Doremy wants to test as\nmany contests as possible. Please give Doremy a solution. Input The input\nconsists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description\nof the test cases follows. The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number\nof contests and Doremy's IQ in the beginning. The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u22ef,a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the\ndifficulty of each contest. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, you need to\noutput a binary string \n    s\n, where \n    s_i=1\n if Doremy should choose to\ntest contest \n    i\n, and \n    s_i=0\n otherwise. The number of ones in the\nstring should be maximum possible, and she should never test a contest when\nher IQ is zero or less. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any.\nExample Input 5 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 3 1 1 2 1 4 2 1 4 3 1 5 2 5 1 2 4 3 Output 1 11\n110 1110 01111 Note In the first test case, Doremy tests the only contest. Her\nIQ doesn't decrease. In the second test case, Doremy tests both contests. Her\nIQ decreases by \n    1\n after testing contest \n    2\n. In the third test case,\nDoremy tests contest \n    1\n and \n    2\n. Her IQ decreases to \n    0\n after\ntesting contest \n    2\n, so she can't test contest \n    3\n.\n\n",
