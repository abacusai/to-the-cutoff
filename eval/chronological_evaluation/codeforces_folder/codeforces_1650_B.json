        "description": "Not so long ago, Vlad came up with an interesting function:\n\n    f_a(x)=\n    \n    \u230a\n    x/a\n    \n    \u230b + x \n     a\n,\nwhere \n    \u230a\n    x/a\n    \n    \u230b\n is\n\n    x/a\n, rounded down, \n    x \n     a\n \u2014 the remainder of the\ninteger division of \n    x\n by \n    a\n.For example, with \n    a=3\n and\n\n    x=11\n, the value \n    f_3(11) =\n    \n    \n    \u230a\n    11/3\n    \n    \u230b + 11 \n     3 = 3 + 2 = 5\n.\nThe number \n    a\n is fixed and known to Vlad. Help Vlad find the maximum\nvalue of \n    f_a(x)\n if \n    x\n can take any integer value from \n    l\n to\n\n    r\n inclusive (\n    l \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 r\n). Input The first line of input\ndata contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ninput test cases. This is followed by \n    t\n lines, each of which contains\nthree integers \n    l_i\n, \n    r_i\n and \n    a_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^9, 1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the left and right boundaries of the\nsegment and the fixed value of \n    a\n. Output For each test case, output one\nnumber on a separate line \u2014 the maximum value of the function on a given\nsegment for a given \n    a\n. Example Input 5 1 4 3 5 8 4 6 10 6 1 1000000000\n1000000000 10 12 8 Output 2 4 5 999999999 5 Note In the first sample:\n\n    f_3(1) = \n    \n    \u230a\n    1/3\n    \n    \u230b + 1 \n     3 = 0 +\n    1 = 1\n, \n    f_3(2) = \n    \n    \u230a\n    2/3\n    \n    \u230b + 2\n    \n     3 = 0 + 2 = 2\n, \n    f_3(3) =\n    \n    \n    \u230a\n    3/3\n    \n    \u230b + 3 \n     3 = 1 + 0 = 1\n,\n\n    f_3(4) = \n    \n    \u230a\n    4/3\n    \n    \u230b + 4 \n     3 = 1 +\n    1 = 2\n As an answer, obviously, \n    f_3(2)\n and \n    f_3(4)\n are suitable.\n\n",
