        "description": "Manao is taking part in a quiz. The quiz consists of n consecutive questions.\nA correct answer gives one point to the player. The game also has a counter of\nconsecutive correct answers. When the player answers a question correctly, the\nnumber on this counter increases by 1. If the player answers a question\nincorrectly, the counter is reset, that is, the number on it reduces to 0. If\nafter an answer the counter reaches the number k, then it is reset, and the\nplayer's score is doubled. Note that in this case, first 1 point is added to\nthe player's score, and then the total score is doubled. At the beginning of\nthe game, both the player's score and the counter of consecutive correct\nanswers are set to zero. Manao remembers that he has answered exactly m\nquestions correctly. But he does not remember the order in which the questions\ncame. He's trying to figure out what his minimum score may be. Help him and\ncompute the remainder of the corresponding number after division by 1000000009\n(10^9 + 9). Input The single line contains three space-separated integers n, m\nand k (2 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^9; 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n). Output Print a single integer \u2014 the\nremainder from division of Manao's minimum possible score in the quiz by\n1000000009 (10^9 + 9). Examples Input 5 3 2 Output 3 Input 5 4 2 Output 6 Note\nSample 1. Manao answered 3 questions out of 5, and his score would double for\neach two consecutive correct answers. If Manao had answered the first, third\nand fifth questions, he would have scored as much as 3 points. Sample 2. Now\nManao answered 4 questions. The minimum possible score is obtained when the\nonly wrong answer is to the question 4. Also note that you are asked to\nminimize the score and not the remainder of the score modulo 1000000009. For\nexample, if Manao could obtain either 2000000000 or 2000000020 points, the\nanswer is 2000000000 mod 1000000009, even though 2000000020 mod 1000000009 is\na smaller number.\n\n",
