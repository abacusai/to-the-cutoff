        "name": "Colorado Potato Beetle",
        "description": "Old MacDonald has a farm and a large potato field, (10^10 + 1) \u00d7 (10^10 + 1)\nsquare meters in size. The field is divided into square garden beds, each bed\ntakes up one square meter. Old McDonald knows that the Colorado potato beetle\nis about to invade his farm and can destroy the entire harvest. To fight the\ninsects, Old McDonald wants to spray some beds with insecticides. So Old\nMcDonald went to the field, stood at the center of the central field bed and\nsprayed this bed with insecticides. Now he's going to make a series of\nmovements and spray a few more beds. During each movement Old McDonald moves\nleft, right, up or down the field some integer number of meters. As Old\nMcDonald moves, he sprays all the beds he steps on. In other words, the beds\nthat have any intersection at all with Old McDonald's trajectory, are sprayed\nwith insecticides. When Old McDonald finished spraying, he wrote out all his\nmovements on a piece of paper. Now he wants to know how many beds won't be\ninfected after the invasion of the Colorado beetles. It is known that the\ninvasion of the Colorado beetles goes as follows. First some bed on the field\nborder gets infected. Than any bed that hasn't been infected, hasn't been\nsprayed with insecticides and has a common side with an infected bed, gets\ninfected as well. Help Old McDonald and determine the number of beds that\nwon't be infected by the Colorado potato beetle. Input The first line contains\nan integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of Old McDonald's movements. Next n\nlines contain the description of Old McDonald's movements. The i-th of these\nlines describes the i-th movement. Each movement is given in the format \"di\nxi\", where di is the character that determines the direction of the movement\n(\"L\", \"R\", \"U\" or \"D\" for directions \"left\", \"right\", \"up\" and \"down\",\ncorrespondingly), and xi (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 10^6) is an integer that determines the\nnumber of meters in the movement. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number\nof beds that won't be infected by the Colorado potato beetle. Please do not\nuse the \npreferred to use the cin, cout streams or the \n5 R 8 U 9 L 9 D 8 L 2 Output 101 Input 7 R 10 D 2 L 7 U 9 D 2 R 3 D 10 Output\n52\n\n",
