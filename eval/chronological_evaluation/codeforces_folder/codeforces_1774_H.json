        "description": "Ecrade bought a deck of cards numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Let the value\nof a permutation \n    a\n of length \n    n\n be \n    min\n    _i = 1^n -\n    k + 1\n     \n    \u2211\n    _j = i^i + k - 1a_j\n. Ecrade wants to find the\nmost valuable one among all permutations of the cards. However, it seems a\nlittle difficult, so please help him! Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. The description of test cases follows. The only line of each test case\ncontains two integers \n    n,k\n (\n    4 \n    \u2264 k < n \n    \u2264 10^5\n). It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^6\n. Output For each test case, output the largest possible value\nin the first line. Then in the second line, print \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n, all \n    a_i\n are\ndistinct) \u2014 the elements of the permutation that has the largest value. If\nthere are multiple such permutations, output any of them. Example Input 2 5 4\n8 4 Output 13 1 4 5 3 2 18 4 2 5 7 8 3 1 6 Note In the first test case,\n\n    [1,4,5,3,2]\n has a value of \n    13\n. It can be shown that no\npermutations of length \n    5\n have a value greater than \n    13\n when \n    k =\n    4\n. In the second test case, \n    [4,2,5,7,8,3,1,6]\n has a value of\n\n    18\n. It can be shown that no permutations of length \n    8\n have a value\ngreater than \n    18\n when \n    k = 4\n.\n\n",
