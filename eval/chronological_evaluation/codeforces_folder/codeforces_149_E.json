        "description": "During the study of the Martians Petya clearly understood that the Martians\nare absolutely lazy. They like to sleep and don't like to wake up. Imagine a\nMartian who has exactly n eyes located in a row and numbered from the left to\nthe right from 1 to n. When a Martian sleeps, he puts a patch on each eye (so\nthat the Martian morning doesn't wake him up). The inner side of each patch\nhas an uppercase Latin letter. So, when a Martian wakes up and opens all his\neyes he sees a string s consisting of uppercase Latin letters. The string's\nlength is n. \"Ding dong!\" \u2014 the alarm goes off. A Martian has already woken up\nbut he hasn't opened any of his eyes. He feels that today is going to be a\nhard day, so he wants to open his eyes and see something good. The Martian\nconsiders only m Martian words beautiful. Besides, it is hard for him to open\nall eyes at once so early in the morning. So he opens two non-overlapping\nsegments of consecutive eyes. More formally, the Martian chooses four numbers\na, b, c, d, (1 \u2264 a \u2264 b < c \u2264 d \u2264 n) and opens all eyes with numbers i such\nthat a \u2264 i \u2264 b or c \u2264 i \u2264 d. After the Martian opens the eyes he needs, he\nreads all the visible characters from the left to the right and thus, he sees\nsome word. Let's consider all different words the Martian can see in the\nmorning. Your task is to find out how many beautiful words are among them.\nInput The first line contains a non-empty string s consisting of uppercase\nLatin letters. The strings' length is n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The second line\ncontains an integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of beautiful words. Next m\nlines contain the beautiful words pi, consisting of uppercase Latin letters.\nTheir length is from 1 to 1000. All beautiful strings are pairwise different.\nOutput Print the single integer \u2014 the number of different beautiful strings\nthe Martian can see this morning. Examples Input ABCBABA 2 BAAB ABBA Output 1\nNote Let's consider the sample test. There the Martian can get only the second\nbeautiful string if he opens segments of eyes a = 1, b = 2 and c = 4, d = 5 or\nof he opens segments of eyes a = 1, b = 2 and c = 6, d = 7.\n\n",
