Now that Heidi is able to distinguish between Poisson and uniform\ndistributions, she is in a good position to actually estimate the populations.\nCan you help Heidi estimate each village's population? Input Same as the easy\nversion. Output Output one line per village, in the same order as provided in\nthe input, containing your (integer) population estimate. Your answer is\nconsidered correct if it is an integer that falls into the interval , where P\nis the real population of the village, used to create the distribution (either\nPoisson or uniform) from which the marmots drew their answers.\n\n",
