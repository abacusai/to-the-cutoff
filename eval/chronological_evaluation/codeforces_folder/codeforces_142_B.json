        "description": "Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Far Far Away lived Sir Lancelot, the chief\nRoyal General. He was very proud of his men and he liked to invite the King to\ncome and watch drill exercises which demonstrated the fighting techniques and\ntactics of the squad he was in charge of. But time went by and one day Sir\nLancelot had a major argument with the Fairy Godmother (there were rumors that\nthe argument occurred after the general spoke badly of the Godmother's flying\ntechniques. That seemed to hurt the Fairy Godmother very deeply). As the\nresult of the argument, the Godmother put a rather strange curse upon the\ngeneral. It sounded all complicated and quite harmless: \"If the squared\ndistance between some two soldiers equals to 5, then those soldiers will\nconflict with each other!\" The drill exercises are held on a rectangular n \u00d7 m\nfield, split into nm square 1 \u00d7 1 segments for each soldier. Thus, the square\nof the distance between the soldiers that stand on squares (x1, y1) and (x2,\ny2) equals exactly (x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2. Now not all nm squad soldiers\ncan participate in the drill exercises as it was before the Fairy Godmother's\ncurse. Unless, of course, the general wants the soldiers to fight with each\nother or even worse... For example, if he puts a soldier in the square (2, 2),\nthen he cannot put soldiers in the squares (1, 4), (3, 4), (4, 1) and (4, 3) \u2014\neach of them will conflict with the soldier in the square (2, 2). Your task is\nto help the general. You are given the size of the drill exercise field. You\nare asked to calculate the maximum number of soldiers that can be\nsimultaneously positioned on this field, so that no two soldiers fall under\nthe Fairy Godmother's curse. Input The single line contains space-separated\nintegers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000) that represent the size of the drill\nexercise field. Output Print the desired maximum number of warriors. Examples\nInput 2 4 Output 4 Input 3 4 Output 6 Note In the first sample test Sir\nLancelot can place his 4 soldiers on the 2 \u00d7 4 court as follows (the soldiers'\nlocations are marked with gray circles on the scheme): In the second sample\ntest he can place 6 soldiers on the 3 \u00d7 4 site in the following manner:\n\n",
