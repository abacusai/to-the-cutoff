        "description": "One foggy Stockholm morning, Karlsson decided to snack on some jam in his\nfriend Lillebror Svantenson's house. Fortunately for Karlsson, there wasn't\nanybody in his friend's house. Karlsson was not going to be hungry any longer,\nso he decided to get some food in the house. Karlsson's gaze immediately fell\non n wooden cupboards, standing in the kitchen. He immediately realized that\nthese cupboards have hidden jam stocks. Karlsson began to fly greedily around\nthe kitchen, opening and closing the cupboards' doors, grab and empty all the\njars of jam that he could find. And now all jars of jam are empty, Karlsson\nhas had enough and does not want to leave traces of his stay, so as not to let\ndown his friend. Each of the cupboards has two doors: the left one and the\nright one. Karlsson remembers that when he rushed to the kitchen, all the\ncupboards' left doors were in the same position (open or closed), similarly,\nall the cupboards' right doors were in the same position (open or closed).\nKarlsson wants the doors to meet this condition as well by the time the family\nreturns. Karlsson does not remember the position of all the left doors, also,\nhe cannot remember the position of all the right doors. Therefore, it does not\nmatter to him in what position will be all left or right doors. It is\nimportant to leave all the left doors in the same position, and all the right\ndoors in the same position. For example, all the left doors may be closed, and\nall the right ones may be open. Karlsson needs one second to open or close a\ndoor of a cupboard. He understands that he has very little time before the\nfamily returns, so he wants to know the minimum number of seconds t, in which\nhe is able to bring all the cupboard doors in the required position. Your task\nis to write a program that will determine the required number of seconds t.\nInput The first input line contains a single integer n \u2014 the number of\ncupboards in the kitchen (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^4). Then follow n lines, each containing\ntwo integers li and ri (0 \u2264 li, ri \u2264 1). Number li equals one, if the left\ndoor of the i-th cupboard is opened, otherwise number li equals zero.\nSimilarly, number ri equals one, if the right door of the i-th cupboard is\nopened, otherwise number ri equals zero. The numbers in the lines are\nseparated by single spaces. Output In the only output line print a single\ninteger t \u2014 the minimum number of seconds Karlsson needs to change the doors\nof all cupboards to the position he needs. Examples Input 5 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0\n1 Output 3\n\n",
