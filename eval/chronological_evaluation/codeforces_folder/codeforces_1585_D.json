        "description": "Petya has an array of integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n. He only likes\nsorted arrays. Unfortunately, the given array could be arbitrary, so Petya\nwants to sort it. Petya likes to challenge himself, so he wants to sort array\nusing only \n    3\n-cycles. More formally, in one operation he can pick \n    3\n\npairwise distinct indices \n    i\n, \n    j\n, and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i, j, k\n    \n    \u2264 n\n) and apply \n    i \n    \u2192 j \n    \u2192 k \n    \u2192 i\n cycle to the array\n\n    a\n. It simultaneously places \n    a_i\n on position \n    j\n, \n    a_j\n on\nposition \n    k\n, and \n    a_k\n on position \n    i\n, without changing any\nother element. For example, if \n    a\n is \n    [10, 50, 20, 30, 40, 60]\n and\nhe chooses \n    i = 2\n, \n    j = 1\n, \n    k = 5\n, then the array becomes\n\n    [\n    50, \n    40, 20, 30, \n    10, 60]\n.\nPetya can apply arbitrary number of \n    3\n-cycles (possibly, zero). You are\nto determine if Petya can sort his array \n    a\n, i. e. make it non-\ndecreasing. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test\ncase contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the array \n    a\n. The second line of each test case\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 n\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print \"YES\"\n(without quotes) if Petya can sort the array \n    a\n using \n    3\n-cycles, and\n\"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper\nor lower). Example Input 7 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 3 1 2 3 3 2 1 3 3 3 1 2 4 2 1 4 3\nOutput YES YES NO YES NO YES YES Note In the \n    6\n-th test case Petya can\nuse the \n    3\n-cycle \n    1 \n    \u2192 3 \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 1\n to sort the array. In\nthe \n    7\n-th test case Petya can apply \n    1 \n    \u2192 3 \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 1\n and\nmake \n    a = [1, 4, 2, 3]\n. Then he can apply \n    2 \n    \u2192 4 \n    \u2192 3 \n    \u2192 2\n\nand finally sort the array.\n\n",
