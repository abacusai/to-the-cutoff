        "description": "Let's name a pair of positive integers \n    (x, y)\n lucky if the greatest\ncommon divisor of them is equal to \n    1\n (\n    (x, y) = 1\n). Let's\ndefine a chain induced by \n    (x, y)\n as a sequence of pairs \n    (x, y)\n,\n\n    (x + 1, y + 1)\n, \n    (x + 2, y + 2)\n, \n    \u2026\n, \n    (x + k, y +\n    k)\n for some integer \n    k \n    \u2265 0\n. The length of the chain is the number\nof pairs it consists of, or \n    (k + 1)\n. Let's name such chain lucky if all\npairs in the chain are lucky. You are given \n    n\n pairs \n    (x_i, y_i)\n.\nCalculate for each pair the length of the longest lucky chain induced by this\npair. Note that if \n    (x_i, y_i)\n is not lucky itself, the chain will have\nthe length \n    0\n. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number of pairs. Next \n    n\n lines\ncontains \n    n\n pairs \u2014 one per line. The \n    i\n-th line contains two\nintegers \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i < y_i \n    \u2264 10^7\n) \u2014 the\ncorresponding pair. Output Print \n    n\n integers, where the \n    i\n-th\ninteger is the length of the longest lucky chain induced by \n    (x_i, y_i)\n\nor \n    -1\n if the chain can be infinitely long. Example Input 4 5 15 13 37 8\n9 10009 20000 Output 0 1 -1 79 Note In the first test case, \n    (5, 15) =\n    5 > 1\n, so it's already not lucky, so the length of the lucky chain is\n\n    0\n. In the second test case, \n    (13 + 1, 37 + 1) = \n    (14, 38) =\n    2\n. So, the lucky chain consists of the single pair \n    (13, 37)\n.\n\n",
