You need to process \n    q\n\nqueries to the array, each of one of the following types: 1 x y: you need to\nassign \n    A_x=y\n; 2 l r: you need to print \n    \u2211\n    _i=l^r\n    A_i\n. Furthermore, there are \n    T\n independent tests you need to process.\nInput The first line contains an integer \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case description starts with\ntwo integers \n    n, q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, q \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the\narray and the number of queries. The following \n    q\n lines contain the\ndescription of queries: \n    1\u00a0x\u00a0y\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 y\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n) for queries of the first type and \n    2\u00a0l\u00a0r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l\n    \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n) for queries of the second type. It is guaranteed that\nthe sum of \n    n\n as well as the sum of \n    q\n does not exceed \n    10^6\n.\nOutput For each query of the second type print its result on a separate line.\nExample Input 2 6 5 2 1 6 1 3 2 2 2 4 1 6 3 2 1 6 5 3 1 3 7 1 1 4 2 1 5 Output\n0 2 5 11\n\n",
