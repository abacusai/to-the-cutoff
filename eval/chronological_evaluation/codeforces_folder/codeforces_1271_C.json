        "description": "The map of the capital of Berland can be viewed on the infinite coordinate\nplane. Each point with integer coordinates contains a building, and there are\nstreets connecting every building to four neighbouring buildings. All streets\nare parallel to the coordinate axes. The main school of the capital is located\nin \n    (s_x, s_y)\n. There are \n    n\n students attending this school, the\n\n    i\n-th of them lives in the house located in \n    (x_i, y_i)\n. It is\npossible that some students live in the same house, but no student lives in\n\n    (s_x, s_y)\n. After classes end, each student walks from the school to his\nhouse along one of the shortest paths. So the distance the \n    i\n-th student\ngoes from the school to his house is \n    |s_x - x_i| + |s_y - y_i|\n. The\nProvision Department of Berland has decided to open a shawarma tent somewhere\nin the capital (at some point with integer coordinates). It is considered that\nthe \n    i\n-th student will buy a shawarma if at least one of the shortest\npaths from the school to the \n    i\n-th student's house goes through the point\nwhere the shawarma tent is located. It is forbidden to place the shawarma tent\nat the point where the school is located, but the coordinates of the shawarma\ntent may coincide with the coordinates of the house of some student (or even\nmultiple students). You want to find the maximum possible number of students\nbuying shawarma and the optimal location for the tent itself. Input The first\nline contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    s_x\n, \n    s_y\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    200\n     000\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 s_x, s_y \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of students\nand the coordinates of the school, respectively. Then \n    n\n lines follow.\nThe \n    i\n-th of them contains two integers \n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264\n    x_i, y_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the location of the house where the \n    i\n-th\nstudent lives. Some locations of houses may coincide, but no student lives in\nthe same location where the school is situated. Output The output should\nconsist of two lines. The first of them should contain one integer \n    c\n \u2014\nthe maximum number of students that will buy shawarmas at the tent. The second\nline should contain two integers \n    p_x\n and \n    p_y\n \u2014 the coordinates\nwhere the tent should be located. If there are multiple answers, print any of\nthem. Note that each of \n    p_x\n and \n    p_y\n should be not less than\n\n    0\n and not greater than \n    10^9\n. Examples Input 4 3 2 1 3 4 2 5 1 4\n1 Output 3 4 2 Input 3 100 100 0 0 0 0 100 200 Output 2 99 100 Input 7 10 12 5\n6 20 23 15 4 16 5 4 54 12 1 4 15 Output 4 10 11 Note In the first example, If\nwe build the shawarma tent in \n    (4, 2)\n, then the students living in \n    (4,\n    2)\n, \n    (4, 1)\n and \n    (5, 1)\n will visit it. In the second example, it\nis possible to build the shawarma tent in \n    (1, 1)\n, then both students\nliving in \n    (0, 0)\n will visit it.\n\n",
