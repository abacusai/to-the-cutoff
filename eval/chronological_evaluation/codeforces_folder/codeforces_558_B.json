        "description": "Amr has got a large array of size n. Amr doesn't like large arrays so he\nintends to make it smaller. Amr doesn't care about anything in the array\nexcept the beauty of it. The beauty of the array is defined to be the maximum\nnumber of times that some number occurs in this array. He wants to choose the\nsmallest subsegment of this array such that the beauty of it will be the same\nas the original array. Help Amr by choosing the smallest subsegment possible.\nInput The first line contains one number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), the size of the\narray. The second line contains n integers ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^6), representing\nelements of the array. Output Output two integers l, r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n), the\nbeginning and the end of the subsegment chosen respectively. If there are\nseveral possible answers you may output any of them. Examples Input 5 1 1 2 2\n1 Output 1 5 Input 5 1 2 2 3 1 Output 2 3 Input 6 1 2 2 1 1 2 Output 1 5 Note\nA subsegment B of an array A from l to r is an array of size r - l + 1 where\nBi = Al + i - 1 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r - l + 1\n\n",
