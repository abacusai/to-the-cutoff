        "description": "David was given a red checkered rectangle of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n. But he\ndoesn't like it. So David cuts the original or any other rectangle piece\nobtained during the cutting into two new pieces along the grid lines. He can\ndo this operation as many times as he wants. As a result, he will get a set of\nrectangles. Rectangles \n    1 \n    \u00d7 1\n are forbidden. David also knows how\nto paint the cells blue. He wants each rectangle from the resulting set of\npieces to be colored such that any pair of adjacent cells by side (from the\nsame piece) have different colors. What is the minimum number of cells David\nwill have to paint? Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next lines\ncontain descriptions of test cases. The only line of each test case contains\ntwo integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n, \n    n\n    \n    \u00b7 m \n    \u2265 2\n). Output For each test case print a single integer \u2014 the\nminimum number of cells David will have to paint blue. Example Input 4 1 3 2 2\n2 5 3 5 Output 1 2 4 5 Note The following pictures show how the initial\nrectangle can be split and cells colored blue. In the first test case: In the\nsecond test case: In the third test case: In the fourth test case:\n\n",
