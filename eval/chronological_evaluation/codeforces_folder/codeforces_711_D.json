        "description": "ZS the Coder and Chris the Baboon has explored Udayland for quite some time.\nThey realize that it consists of n towns numbered from 1 to n. There are n\ndirected roads in the Udayland. i-th of them goes from town i to some other\ntown ai (ai \u2260 i). ZS the Coder can flip the direction of any road in Udayland,\ni.e. if it goes from town A to town B before the flip, it will go from town B\nto town A after. ZS the Coder considers the roads in the Udayland confusing,\nif there is a sequence of distinct towns A1, A2, ..., Ak (k > 1) such that for\nevery 1 \u2264 i < k there is a road from town Ai to town Ai + 1 and another road\nfrom town Ak to town A1. In other words, the roads are confusing if some of\nthem form a directed cycle of some towns. Now ZS the Coder wonders how many\nsets of roads (there are 2^n variants) in initial configuration can he choose\nto flip such that after flipping each road in the set exactly once, the\nresulting network will not be confusing. Note that it is allowed that after\nthe flipping there are more than one directed road from some town and possibly\nsome towns with no roads leading out of it, or multiple roads between any pair\nof cities. Input The first line of the input contains single integer n (2 \u2264 n\n\u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of towns in Udayland. The next line contains n integers\na1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 n, ai \u2260 i), ai denotes a road going from town i to\ntown ai. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of ways to flip some set\nof the roads so that the resulting whole set of all roads is not confusing.\nSince this number may be too large, print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples\nInput 3 2 3 1 Output 6 Input 4 2 1 1 1 Output 8 Input 5 2 4 2 5 3 Output 28\nNote Consider the first sample case. There are 3 towns and 3 roads. The towns\nare numbered from 1 to 3 and the roads are , , initially. Number the roads 1\nto 3 in this order. The sets of roads that ZS the Coder can flip (to make them\nnot confusing) are 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3. Note that the empty\nset is invalid because if no roads are flipped, then towns 1, 2, 3 is form a\ndirected cycle, so it is confusing. Similarly, flipping all roads is confusing\ntoo. Thus, there are a total of 6 possible sets ZS the Coder can flip. The\nsample image shows all possible ways of orienting the roads from the first\nsample such that the network is not confusing.\n\n",
