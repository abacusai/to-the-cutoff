        "description": "You are given \n    n\n arrays that can have different sizes. You also have a\ntable with \n    w\n columns and \n    n\n rows. The \n    i\n-th array is placed\nhorizontally in the \n    i\n-th row. You can slide each array within its row as\nlong as it occupies several consecutive cells and lies completely inside the\ntable. You need to find the maximum sum of the integers in the \n    j\n-th\ncolumn for each \n    j\n from \n    1\n to \n    w\n independently. Optimal\nplacements for columns \n    1\n, \n    2\n and \n    3\n are shown on the pictures\nfrom left to right. Note that you can exclude any array out of a column\nprovided it remains in the window. In this case its value is considered to be\nzero. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^6\n) and \n    w\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 w \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number of arrays\nand the width of the table. Each of the next \n    n\n lines consists of an\ninteger \n    l_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i\n    \u2264 w\n), the length of the\n\n    i\n-th array, followed by \n    l_i\n integers \n    a_i1, a_i2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_il_i\n (\n    -10^9\n    \u2264 a_ij\n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the elements\nof the array. The total length of the arrays does no exceed \n    10^6\n.\nOutput Print \n    w\n integers, the \n    i\n-th of them should be the maximum\nsum for column \n    i\n. Examples Input 3 3 3 2 4 8 2 2 5 2 6 3 Output 10 15 16\nInput 2 2 2 7 8 1 -8 Output 7 8 Note Illustration for the first example is in\nthe statement.\n\n",
