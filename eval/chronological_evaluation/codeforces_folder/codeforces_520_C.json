        "description": "Vasya became interested in bioinformatics. He's going to write an article\nabout similar cyclic DNA sequences, so he invented a new method for\ndetermining the similarity of cyclic sequences. Let's assume that strings s\nand t have the same length n, then the function h(s, t) is defined as the\nnumber of positions in which the respective symbols of s and t are the same.\nFunction h(s, t) can be used to define the function of Vasya distance \u03c1(s, t):\nwhere is obtained from string s, by applying left circular shift i times. For\nexample, \u03c1(\"AGC\", \"CGT\") = h(\"AGC\", \"CGT\") + h(\"AGC\", \"GTC\") + h(\"AGC\", \"TCG\")\n+ h(\"GCA\", \"CGT\") + h(\"GCA\", \"GTC\") + h(\"GCA\", \"TCG\") + h(\"CAG\", \"CGT\") +\nh(\"CAG\", \"GTC\") + h(\"CAG\", \"TCG\") = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 6\nVasya found a string s of length n on the Internet. Now he wants to count how\nmany strings t there are such that the Vasya distance from the string s\nattains maximum possible value. Formally speaking, t must satisfy the\nequation: . Vasya could not try all possible strings to find an answer, so he\nneeds your help. As the answer may be very large, count the number of such\nstrings modulo 10^9 + 7. Input The first line of the input contains a single\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The second line of the input contains a single\nstring of length n, consisting of characters \"ACGT\". Output Print a single\nnumber \u2014 the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input 1 C Output 1 Input 2 AG\nOutput 4 Input 3 TTT Output 1 Note Please note that if for two distinct\nstrings t1 and t2 values \u03c1(s, t1) \u0438 \u03c1(s, t2) are maximum among all possible t,\nthen both strings must be taken into account in the answer even if one of them\ncan be obtained by a circular shift of another one. In the first sample, there\nis \u03c1(\"C\", \"C\") = 1, for the remaining strings t of length 1 the value of \u03c1(s,\nt) is 0. In the second sample, \u03c1(\"AG\", \"AG\") = \u03c1(\"AG\", \"GA\") = \u03c1(\"AG\", \"AA\") =\n\u03c1(\"AG\", \"GG\") = 4. In the third sample, \u03c1(\"TTT\", \"TTT\") = 27\n\n",
