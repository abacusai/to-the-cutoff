        "description": "Thumbelina has had an accident. She has found herself on a little island in\nthe middle of a swamp and wants to get to the shore very much. One can get to\nthe shore only by hills that are situated along a straight line that connects\nthe little island with the shore. Let us assume that the hills are numbered\nfrom 1 to n and the number of a hill is equal to the distance in meters\nbetween it and the island. The distance between the n-th hill and the shore is\nalso 1 meter. Thumbelina is too small to make such jumps. Fortunately, a\nfamily of frogs living in the swamp suggests to help her. Each frog agrees to\ngive Thumbelina a ride but Thumbelina should choose only one frog. Each frog\nhas a certain jump length. If Thumbelina agrees to accept help from a frog\nwhose jump length is d, the frog will jump from the island on the hill d, then\n\u2014 on the hill 2d, then 3d and so on until they get to the shore (i.e. find\nitself beyond the hill n). However, there is one more problem: mosquitoes also\nlive in the swamp. At the moment they have a siesta, and they are having a nap\non some hills. If the frog jumps on a hill with a mosquito the frog will smash\nit. The frogs Thumbelina has met are pacifists, so they will find the death of\neach mosquito very much sad. Help Thumbelina choose a frog that will bring her\nto the shore and smash as small number of mosquitoes as possible. Input The\nfirst line contains three integers n, m and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 m, k \u2264 100) \u2014\nthe number of hills, frogs and mosquitoes respectively. The second line\ncontains m integers di (1 \u2264 di \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the lengths of the frogs\u2019 jumps. The\nthird line contains k integers \u2014 the numbers of the hills on which each\nmosquito is sleeping. No more than one mosquito can sleep on each hill. The\nnumbers in the lines are separated by single spaces. Output In the first line\noutput the number of frogs that smash the minimal number of mosquitoes, in the\nsecond line \u2014 their numbers in increasing order separated by spaces. The frogs\nare numbered from 1 to m in the order of the jump length given in the input\ndata.
