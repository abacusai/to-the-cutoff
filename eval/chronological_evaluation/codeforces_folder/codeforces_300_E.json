        "description": "In a far away galaxy there is war again. The treacherous Republic made k\nprecision strikes of power ai on the Empire possessions. To cope with the\nrepublican threat, the Supreme Council decided to deal a decisive blow to the\nenemy forces. To successfully complete the conflict, the confrontation balance\nafter the blow should be a positive integer. The balance of confrontation is a\nnumber that looks like , where p = n! (n is the power of the Imperial strike),\n. After many years of war the Empire's resources are low. So to reduce the\ncosts, n should be a minimum positive integer that is approved by the\ncommanders. Help the Empire, find the minimum positive integer n, where the\ndescribed fraction is a positive integer. Input The first line contains\ninteger k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^6). The second line contains k integers a1, a2, ..., ak\n(1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^7). Output Print the minimum positive integer n, needed for the\nEmpire to win. Please, do not use the \n\u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the \nExamples Input 2 1000 1000 Output 2000 Input 1 2 Output 2\n\n",
