        "description": "You have a string \n    s\n \u2014 a sequence of commands for your toy robot. The\nrobot is placed in some cell of a rectangular grid. He can perform four\ncommands: 'W' \u2014 move one cell up; 'S' \u2014 move one cell down; 'A' \u2014 move one\ncell left; 'D' \u2014 move one cell right. Let \n    Grid(s)\n be the grid of minimum\npossible area such that there is a position in the grid where you can place\nthe robot in such a way that it will not fall from the grid while running the\nsequence of commands \n    s\n. For example, if \n    s = \n    DSAWWAW\n then\n\n    Grid(s)\n is the \n    4 \n    \u00d7 3\n grid: you can place the robot in the\ncell \n    (3, 2)\n; the robot performs the command 'D' and moves to \n    (3,\n    3)\n; the robot performs the command 'S' and moves to \n    (4, 3)\n; the robot\nperforms the command 'A' and moves to \n    (4, 2)\n; the robot performs the\ncommand 'W' and moves to \n    (3, 2)\n; the robot performs the command 'W' and\nmoves to \n    (2, 2)\n; the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to \n    (2,\n    1)\n; the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to \n    (1, 1)\n. You have\n\n    4\n extra letters: one 'W', one 'A', one 'S', one 'D'. You'd like to\ninsert at most one of these letters in any position of sequence \n    s\n to\nminimize the area of \n    Grid(s)\n. What is the minimum area of \n    Grid(s)\n\nyou can achieve? Input The first line contains one integer \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    T \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of queries. Next \n    T\n lines contain queries:\none per line. This line contains single string \n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 |s| \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    s_i \n    \u2208\n    \n    \n    W, \n    A, \n    S,\n    \n    D\n) \u2014 the sequence of commands. It's guaranteed that the total\nlength of \n    s\n over all queries doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output\nPrint \n    T\n integers: one per query. For each query print the minimum area\nof \n    Grid(s)\n you can achieve. Example Input 3 DSAWWAW D WA Output 8 2 4\nNote In the first query you have to get string\n\n    DSAWW\n    D\n    AW\n. In second and third queries\nyou can not decrease the area of \n    Grid(s)\n.\n\n",
