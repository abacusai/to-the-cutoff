        "description": "Timur likes his name. As a spelling of his name, he allows any permutation of\nthe letters of the name. For example, the following strings are valid\nspellings of his name: Timur, miurT, Trumi, mriTu. Note that the correct\nspelling must have uppercased T and lowercased other letters. Today he wrote\nstring \n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting only of uppercase or lowercase\nLatin letters. He asks you to check if \n    s\n is the correct spelling of his\nname. Input The first line of the input contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each\ntest case contains an integer \n    n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10)\n \u2014 the\nlength of string \n    s\n. The second line of each test case contains a string\n\n    s\n consisting of only uppercase or lowercase Latin characters. Output For\neach test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if \n    s\n satisfies the\ncondition, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output the answer in\nany case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will be\nrecognized as a positive answer). Example Input 10 5 Timur 5 miurT 5 Trumi 5\nmriTu 5 timur 4 Timr 6 Timuur 10 codeforces 10 TimurTimur 5 TIMUR Output YES\nYES YES YES NO NO NO NO NO NO\n\n",
