        "description": "This is an interactive problem. Remember to flush your output while\ncommunicating with the testing program. You may use fflush(stdout) in C++,\nsystem.out.flush() in Java, stdout.flush() in Python or flush(output) in\nPascal to flush the output. If you use some other programming language,\nconsult its documentation. You may also refer to the guide on interactive\nproblems: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307. The jury has chosen a\nstring \n    s\n consisting of \n    n\n characters; each character of \n    s\n is\na lowercase Latin letter. Your task is to guess this string; initially, you\nknow only its length. You may ask queries of two types: \n    1\n \n    i\n \u2014 the\nquery of the first type, where \n    i\n is an integer from \n    1\n to \n    n\n.\nIn response to this query, the jury will tell you the character \n    s_i\n;\n\n    2\n \n    l\n \n    r\n \u2014 the query of the second type, where \n    l\n and\n\n    r\n are integers such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n. In response to\nthis query, the jury will tell you the number of different characters among\n\n    s_l, s_l+1, \n    \u2026, s_r\n. You are allowed to ask no more than \n    26\n\nqueries of the first type, and no more than \n    6000\n queries of the second\ntype. Your task is to restore the string \n    s\n. For each test in this\nproblem, the string \n    s\n is fixed beforehand, and will be the same for\nevery submission. Input Initially, the jury program sends one integer \n    n\n\non a separate line \u2014 the size of \n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n). Output\nTo give the answer, print one line ! s with a line break in the end, where\n\n    s\n should be the string picked by the jury. After that, your program\nshould flush the output and terminate gracefully. Interaction To ask a query,\nyou should send one line containing the query, in one of the following\nformats: ? 1 i \u2014 for a query of the first type (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n); ? 2\nl r \u2014 for a query of the second type (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n). Don't\nforget to flush the output after sending the query line. The answer to your\nquery will be given on a separate line. For a query of the first type, the\nanswer will be the character \n    s_i\n. For a query of the second type, the\nanswer will be an integer equal to the number of different characters among\n\n    s_l, s_l+1, \n    \u2026, s_r\n. You are allowed to ask no more than \n    26\n\nqueries of the first type, and no more than \n    6000\n queries of the second\ntype. In case you ask too many queries, or the jury program fails to recognize\nyour query format, the answer to your query will be one integer \n    0\n. After\nreceiving \n    0\n as the answer, your program should terminate immediately \u2014\notherwise you may receive verdict \"Runtime error\", \"Time limit exceeded\" or\nsome other verdict instead of \"Wrong answer\". Example Input 5 4 u 2 g e s 1\nOutput ? 2 1 5 ? 1 2 ? 2 1 2 ? 1 1 ? 1 3 ? 1 4 ? 2 4 5 ! guess Note Let's\nanalyze the example of interaction. The string chosen by the jury is guess, so\ninitially the jury sends one integer \n    5\n. the first query is ? 2 1 5,\nwhich means \"count the number of different characters among \n    s_1, s_2,\n    \n    \u2026, s_5\n\". The answer to it is \n    4\n. the second query is ? 1 2,\nwhich means \"tell which character is \n    s_2\n\". The answer to it is u. the\nthird query is ? 2 1 2, which means \"count the number of different characters\namong \n    s_1\n and \n    s_2\n\". The answer to it is \n    2\n. the fourth query\nis ? 1 1, which means \"tell which character is \n    s_1\n\". The answer to it is\ng. the fifth query is ? 1 3, which means \"tell which character is \n    s_3\n\".\nThe answer to it is e. the sixth query is ? 1 4, which means \"tell which\ncharacter is \n    s_4\n\". The answer to it is s. the seventh query is ? 2 4 5,\nwhich means \"count the number of different characters among \n    s_4\n and\n\n    s_5\n\". The answer to it is \n    1\n, so it's possible to deduce that\n\n    s_4\n is the same as \n    s_5\n.In the end, the answer is submitted as !\nguess, and it is deduced correctly.\n\n",
