        "description": "Emuskald needs a fence around his farm, but he is too lazy to build it\nhimself. So he purchased a fence-building robot. He wants the fence to be a\nregular polygon. The robot builds the fence along a single path, but it can\nonly make fence corners at a single angle a. Will the robot be able to build\nthe fence Emuskald wants? In other words, is there a regular polygon which\nangles are equal to a? Input The first line of input contains an integer t (0\n< t < 180) \u2014 the number of tests. Each of the following t lines contains a\nsingle integer a (0 < a < 180) \u2014 the angle the robot can make corners at\nmeasured in degrees. Output For each test, output on a single line \"YES\"\n(without quotes), if the robot can build a fence Emuskald wants, and \"NO\"\n(without quotes), if it is impossible. Examples Input 3 30 60 90 Output NO YES\nYES Note In the first test case, it is impossible to build the fence, since\nthere is no regular polygon with angle . In the second test case, the fence is\na regular triangle, and in the last test case \u2014 a square.\n\n",
