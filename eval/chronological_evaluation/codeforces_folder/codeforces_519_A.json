        "name": "A and B and Chess",
        "description": "A and B are preparing themselves for programming contests. To train their\nlogical thinking and solve problems better, A and B decided to play chess.\nDuring the game A wondered whose position is now stronger. For each chess\npiece we know its weight: the queen's weight is 9, the rook's weight is 5, the\nbishop's weight is 3, the knight's weight is 3, the pawn's weight is 1, the\nking's weight isn't considered in evaluating position. The player's weight\nequals to the sum of weights of all his pieces on the board. As A doesn't like\ncounting, he asked you to help him determine which player has the larger\nposition weight. Input The input contains eight lines, eight characters each \u2014\nthe board's description. The white pieces on the board are marked with\nuppercase letters, the black pieces are marked with lowercase letters. The\nwhite pieces are denoted as follows: the queen is represented is 'Q', the rook\n\u2014 as 'R', the bishop \u2014 as'B', the knight \u2014 as 'N', the pawn \u2014 as 'P', the king\n\u2014 as 'K'. The black pieces are denoted as 'q', 'r', 'b', 'n', 'p', 'k',\nrespectively. An empty square of the board is marked as '.' (a dot). It is not\nguaranteed that the given chess position can be achieved in a real game.\nSpecifically, there can be an arbitrary (possibly zero) number pieces of each\ntype, the king may be under attack and so on. Output Print \"White\" (without\nquotes) if the weight of the position of the white pieces is more than the\nweight of the position of the black pieces, print \"Black\" if the weight of the\nblack pieces is more than the weight of the white pieces and print \"Draw\" if\nthe weights of the white and black pieces are equal. Examples Input ...QK...\n........ ........ ........ ........ ........ ........ ...rk... Output White\nInput rnbqkbnr pppppppp ........ ........ ........ ........ PPPPPPPP RNBQKBNR\nOutput Draw Input rppppppr ...k.... ........ ........ ........ ........\nK...Q... ........ Output Black Note In the first test sample the weight of the\nposition of the white pieces equals to 9, the weight of the position of the\nblack pieces equals 5. In the second test sample the weights of the positions\nof the black and the white pieces are equal to 39. In the third test sample\nthe weight of the position of the white pieces equals to 9, the weight of the\nposition of the black pieces equals to 16.\n\n",
