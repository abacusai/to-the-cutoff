        "description": "The stardate is 1983, and Princess Heidi is getting better at detecting the\nDeath Stars. This time, two Rebel spies have yet again given Heidi two maps\nwith the possible locations of the Death Star. Since she got rid of all double\nagents last time, she knows that both maps are correct, and indeed show the\nmap of the solar system that contains the Death Star. However, this time the\nEmpire has hidden the Death Star very well, and Heidi needs to find a place\nthat appears on both maps in order to detect the Death Star. The first map is\nan N \u00d7 M grid, each cell of which shows some type of cosmic object that is\npresent in the corresponding quadrant of space. The second map is an M \u00d7 N\ngrid. Heidi needs to align those two maps in such a way that they overlap over\nsome M \u00d7 M section in which all cosmic objects are identical. Help Heidi by\nidentifying where such an M \u00d7 M section lies within both maps. Input The first\nline of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M (1 \u2264 N \u2264 2000,\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 200, M \u2264 N). The next N lines each contain M lower-case Latin\ncharacters (a-z), denoting the first map. Different characters correspond to\ndifferent cosmic object types. The next M lines each contain N characters,\ndescribing the second map in the same format. Output The only line of the\noutput should contain two space-separated integers i and j, denoting that the\nsection of size M \u00d7 M in the first map that starts at the i-th row is equal to\nthe section of the second map that starts at the j-th column. Rows and columns\nare numbered starting from 1. If there are several possible ways to align the\nmaps, Heidi will be satisfied with any of those. It is guaranteed that a\nsolution exists.
