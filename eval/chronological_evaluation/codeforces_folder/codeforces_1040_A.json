        "description": "A group of \n    n\n dancers rehearses a performance for the closing ceremony.\nThe dancers are arranged in a row, they've studied their dancing moves and\ncan't change positions. For some of them, a white dancing suit is already\nbought, for some of them \u2014 a black one, and for the rest the suit will be\nbought in the future. On the day when the suits were to be bought, the\ndirector was told that the participants of the olympiad will be happy if the\ncolors of the suits on the scene will form a palindrome. A palindrome is a\nsequence that is the same when read from left to right and when read from\nright to left. The director liked the idea, and she wants to buy suits so that\nthe color of the leftmost dancer's suit is the same as the color of the\nrightmost dancer's suit, the 2nd left is the same as 2nd right, and so on. The\ndirector knows how many burls it costs to buy a white suit, and how many burls\nto buy a black suit. You need to find out whether it is possible to buy suits\nto form a palindrome, and if it's possible, what's the minimal cost of doing\nso. Remember that dancers can not change positions, and due to bureaucratic\nreasons it is not allowed to buy new suits for the dancers who already have\nsuits, even if it reduces the overall spending. Input The first line contains\nthree integers \n    n\n, \n    a\n, and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 20\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of dancers, the cost of a white suit,\nand the cost of a black suit. The next line contains \n    n\n numbers\n\n    c_i\n, \n    i\n-th of which denotes the color of the suit of the \n    i\n-th\ndancer. Number \n    0\n denotes the white color, \n    1\n \u2014 the black color, and\n\n    2\n denotes that a suit for this dancer is still to be bought. Output If\nit is not possible to form a palindrome without swapping dancers and buying\nnew suits for those who have one, then output -1. Otherwise, output the\nminimal price to get the desired visual effect. Examples Input 5 100 1 0 1 2 1\n2 Output 101 Input 3 10 12 1 2 0 Output -1 Input 3 12 1 0 1 0 Output 0 Note In\nthe first sample, the cheapest way to obtain palindromic colors is to buy a\nblack suit for the third from left dancer and a white suit for the rightmost\ndancer. In the second sample, the leftmost dancer's suit already differs from\nthe rightmost dancer's suit so there is no way to obtain the desired coloring.\nIn the third sample, all suits are already bought and their colors form a\npalindrome.\n\n",
