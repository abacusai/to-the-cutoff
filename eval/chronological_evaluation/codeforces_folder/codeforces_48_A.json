        "description": "Uncle Fyodor, Matroskin the Cat and Sharic the Dog live their simple but happy\nlives in Prostokvashino. Sometimes they receive parcels from Uncle Fyodor\u2019s\nparents and sometimes from anonymous benefactors, in which case it is hard to\ndetermine to which one of them the package has been sent. A photographic rifle\nis obviously for Sharic who loves hunting and fish is for Matroskin, but for\nwhom was a new video game console meant? Every one of the three friends\nclaimed that the present is for him and nearly quarreled. Uncle Fyodor had an\nidea how to solve the problem justly: they should suppose that the console was\nsent to all three of them and play it in turns. Everybody got relieved but\nthen yet another burning problem popped up \u2014 who will play first? This time\nMatroskin came up with a brilliant solution, suggesting the most fair way to\nfind it out: play rock-paper-scissors together. The rules of the game are very\nsimple. On the count of three every player shows a combination with his hand\n(or paw). The combination corresponds to one of three things: a rock, scissors\nor paper. Some of the gestures win over some other ones according to well-\nknown rules: the rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the\npaper gets wrapped over the stone. Usually there are two players. Yet there\nare three friends, that\u2019s why they decided to choose the winner like that: If\nsomeone shows the gesture that wins over the other two players, then that\nplayer wins. Otherwise, another game round is required. Write a program that\nwill determine the winner by the gestures they have shown. Input The first\ninput line contains the name of the gesture that Uncle Fyodor showed, the\nsecond line shows which gesture Matroskin showed and the third line shows\nSharic\u2019s gesture. Output Print \"F\" (without quotes) if Uncle Fyodor wins.\nPrint \"M\" if Matroskin wins and \"S\" if Sharic wins. If it is impossible to\nfind the winner, print \"?\". Examples Input rock rock rock Output ? Input paper\nrock rock Output F Input scissors rock rock Output ? Input scissors paper rock\nOutput ?\n\n",
