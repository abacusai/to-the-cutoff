        "description": "It is lunch time for Mole. His friend, Marmot, prepared him a nice game for\nlunch. Marmot brought Mole n ordered piles of worms such that i-th pile\ncontains ai worms. He labeled all these worms with consecutive integers: worms\nin first pile are labeled with numbers 1 to a1, worms in second pile are\nlabeled with numbers a1 + 1 to a1 + a2 and so on. See the example for a better\nunderstanding. Mole can't eat all the worms (Marmot brought a lot) and, as we\nall know, Mole is blind, so Marmot tells him the labels of the best juicy\nworms. Marmot will only give Mole a worm if Mole says correctly in which pile\nthis worm is contained. Poor Mole asks for your help. For all juicy worms said\nby Marmot, tell Mole the correct answers. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), the number of piles. The second line contains\nn integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^3, a1 + a2 + ... + an \u2264 10^6), where\nai is the number of worms in the i-th pile. The third line contains single\ninteger m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5), the number of juicy worms said by Marmot. The fourth\nline contains m integers q1, q2, ..., qm (1 \u2264 qi \u2264 a1 + a2 + ... + an), the\nlabels of the juicy worms. Output Print m lines to the standard output. The\ni-th line should contain an integer, representing the number of the pile where\nthe worm labeled with the number qi is. Examples Input 5 2 7 3 4 9 3 1 25 11\nOutput 1 5 3 Note For the sample input: The worms with labels from [1, 2] are\nin the first pile. The worms with labels from [3, 9] are in the second pile.\nThe worms with labels from [10, 12] are in the third pile. The worms with\nlabels from [13, 16] are in the fourth pile. The worms with labels from [17,\n25] are in the fifth pile.\n\n",
