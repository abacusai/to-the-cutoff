        "name": "Walking Boy",
        "description": "One of the SWERC judges has a dog named Boy. Besides being a good competitive\nprogrammer, Boy loves fresh air, so she wants to be walked at least twice a\nday. Walking Boy requires \n    120\n consecutive minutes. Two walks cannot\noverlap, but one can start as soon as the previous one has finished. Boy\nbefore and after getting ACCEPTED on this problem. Today, the judge sent\n\n    n\n messages to the SWERC Discord server. The \n    i\n-th message was sent\n\n    a_i\n minutes after midnight. You know that, when walking Boy, the judge\ndoes not send any messages, but he can send a message right before or right\nafter a walk. Is it possible that the judge walked Boy at least twice today?\nNote that a day has \n    1440\n minutes, and a walk is considered to happen\ntoday if it starts at a minute \n    s \n    \u2265 0\n and ends right before a minute\n\n    e \n    \u2264 1440\n. In that case, it must hold that \n    e - s = 120\n and, for\nevery \n    i = 1, \n      2 \n     \n    \u2026, \n      n\n, either \n    a_i \n    \u2264 s\n or\n\n    a_i \n    \u2265 e\n. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first\nline contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The descriptions of the \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line\nof each test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014\nthe number of messages sent by the judge. The second line of each test case\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, \n      a_2, \n     \n    \u2026, \n      a_n\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 a_1 < a_2 < \n    \u22ef < a_n < 1440\n) \u2014 the times at which the messages\nhave been sent (in minutes elapsed from midnight). Output For each test case,\noutput one line containing \n    \n if it is possible that Boy has\nbeen walked at least twice, and \n    \n otherwise. Example Input 6\n14 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 12 100 200 300\n400 600 700 800 900 1100 1200 1300 1400 13 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\n1100 1200 1300 1400 13 101 189 272 356 463 563 659 739 979 1071 1170 1274 1358\n1 42 5 0 1 2 3 4 Output NO YES NO YES YES YES Note In the first test case, the\njudge has sent a message at each time multiple of \n    100\n (excluding\n\n    0\n). It is impossible that he has walked Boy even once. In the second\ntest case, the times are the same as above, but \n    500\n and \n    1000\n are\nmissing. The judge could have walked Boy, for instance, during the time\nintervals \n    [440, 560]\n and \n    [980, 1100]\n. The situation is illustrated\nin the picture below, where the walks are represented by green intervals.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n In the third test case, the times are the same as in the first\ntest case, but \n    1000\n is missing. The judge could have walked Boy at most\nonce. In the fourth test case, Boy could have been walked during the time\nintervals \n    [739, 859]\n and \n    [859, 979]\n.\n\n",
