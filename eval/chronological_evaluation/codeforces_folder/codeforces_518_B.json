        "name": "Tanya and Postcard",
        "description": "Little Tanya decided to present her dad a postcard on his Birthday. She has\nalready created a message \u2014 string s of length n, consisting of uppercase and\nlowercase English letters. Tanya can't write yet, so she found a newspaper and\ndecided to cut out the letters and glue them into the postcard to achieve\nstring s. The newspaper contains string t, consisting of uppercase and\nlowercase English letters. We know that the length of string t greater or\nequal to the length of the string s. The newspaper may possibly have too few\nof some letters needed to make the text and too many of some other letters.\nThat's why Tanya wants to cut some n letters out of the newspaper and make a\nmessage of length exactly n, so that it looked as much as possible like s. If\nthe letter in some position has correct value and correct letter case (in the\nstring s and in the string that Tanya will make), then she shouts joyfully\n\"YAY!\", and if the letter in the given position has only the correct value but\nit is in the wrong case, then the girl says \"WHOOPS\". Tanya wants to make such\nmessage that lets her shout \"YAY!\" as much as possible. If there are multiple\nways to do this, then her second priority is to maximize the number of times\nshe says \"WHOOPS\". Your task is to help Tanya make the message. Input The\nfirst line contains line s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 2\u00b710^5), consisting of uppercase and\nlowercase English letters \u2014 the text of Tanya's message. The second line\ncontains line t (|s| \u2264 |t| \u2264 2\u00b710^5), consisting of uppercase and lowercase\nEnglish letters \u2014 the text written in the newspaper. Here |a| means the length\nof the string a. Output Print two integers separated by a space: the first\nnumber is the number of times Tanya shouts \"YAY!\" while making the message,\nthe second number is the number of times Tanya says \"WHOOPS\" while making the\nmessage. Examples Input AbC DCbA Output 3 0 Input ABC abc Output 0 3 Input\nabacaba AbaCaBA Output 3 4\n\n",
