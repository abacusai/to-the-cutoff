        "description": "Kevin has just recevied his disappointing results on the USA Identification of\nCows Olympiad (USAICO) in the form of a binary string of length n. Each\ncharacter of Kevin's string represents Kevin's score on one of the n questions\nof the olympiad\u2014'1' for a correctly identified cow and '0' otherwise. However,\nall is not lost. Kevin is a big proponent of alternative thinking and believes\nthat his score, instead of being the sum of his points, should be the length\nof the longest alternating subsequence of his string. Here, we define an\nalternating subsequence of a string as a not-necessarily contiguous\nsubsequence where no two consecutive elements are equal. For example, 0, 1,\n0, 1, 1, 0, 1, and 1, 0, 1, 0 are alternating sequences, while 1, 0, 0\nand 0, 1, 0, 1, 1 are not. Kevin, being the sneaky little puffball that he\nis, is willing to hack into the USAICO databases to improve his score. In\norder to be subtle, he decides that he will flip exactly one substring\u2014that\nis, take a contiguous non-empty substring of his score and change all '0's in\nthat substring to '1's and vice versa. After such an operation, Kevin wants to\nknow the length of the longest possible alternating subsequence that his\nstring could have. Input The first line contains the number of questions on\nthe olympiad n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000). The following line contains a binary string\nof length n representing Kevin's results on the USAICO. Output Output a single\ninteger, the length of the longest possible alternating subsequence that Kevin\ncan create in his string after flipping a single substring. Examples Input 8\n10000011 Output 5 Input 2 01 Output 2 Note In the first sample, Kevin can flip\nthe bolded substring '10000011' and turn his string into '10011011', which has\nan alternating subsequence of length 5: '10011011'. In the second sample,\nKevin can flip the entire string and still have the same score.\n\n",
