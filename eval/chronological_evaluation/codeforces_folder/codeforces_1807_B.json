        "description": "Mihai and Bianca are playing with bags of candies. They have a row \n    a\n of\n\n    n\n bags of candies. The \n    i\n-th bag has \n    a_i\n candies. The bags\nare given to the players in the order from the first bag to the \n    n\n-th\nbag. If a bag has an even number of candies, Mihai grabs the bag. Otherwise,\nBianca grabs the bag. Once a bag is grabbed, the number of candies in it gets\nadded to the total number of candies of the player that took it. Mihai wants\nto show off, so he wants to reorder the array so that at any moment (except at\nthe start when they both have no candies), Mihai will have strictly more\ncandies than Bianca. Help Mihai find out if such a reordering exists. Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains\na single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of bags in\nthe array. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n space-separated\nintegers \n    a_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of candies in\neach bag. Output For each test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if such a\nreordering exists, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output the\nanswer in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\"\nwill be recognized as a positive answer). Example Input 3 4 1 2 3 4 4 1 1 1 2\n3 1 4 3 Output YES NO NO Note In the first test case, Mihai can reorder the\narray as follows: \n    [4, 1, 2, 3]\n. Then the process proceeds as follows:\nthe first bag has \n    4\n candies, which is even, so Mihai takes it \u2014 Mihai\nhas \n    4\n candies, and Bianca has \n    0\n. the second bag has \n    1\n\ncandies, which is odd, so Bianca takes it \u2014 Mihai has \n    4\n candies, and\nBianca has \n    1\n. the third bag has \n    2\n candies, which is even, so Mihai\ntakes it \u2014 Mihai has \n    6\n candies, and Bianca has \n    1\n. the fourth bag\nhas \n    3\n candies, which is odd, so Bianca takes it \u2014 Mihai has \n    6\n\ncandies, and Bianca has \n    4\n. Since Mihai always has more candies than\nBianca, this reordering works.\n\n",
