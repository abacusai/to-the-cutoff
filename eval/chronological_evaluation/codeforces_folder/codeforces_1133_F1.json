        "description": "You are given an undirected unweighted connected graph consisting of \n    n\n\nvertices and \n    m\n edges. It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or\nmultiple edges in the given graph. Your task is to find any spanning tree of\nthis graph such that the maximum degree over all vertices is maximum possible.\nRecall that the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\nInput The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    n - 1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 min(2 \n    \u00b7 10^5,\n    \n    n(n-1)/2)\n) \u2014 the number of vertices and edges, respectively. The\nfollowing \n    m\n lines denote edges: edge \n    i\n is represented by a pair of\nintegers \n    v_i\n, \n    u_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 v_i, u_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    u_i \n    \n    v_i\n), which are the indices of vertices connected by the edge. There are no\nloops or multiple edges in the given graph, i. e. for each pair (\n    v_i,\n    u_i\n) there are no other pairs (\n    v_i, u_i\n) or (\n    u_i, v_i\n) in the\nlist of edges, and for each pair \n    (v_i, u_i)\n the condition \n    v_i \n    \n    u_i\n is satisfied. Output Print \n    n-1\n lines describing the edges of a\nspanning tree such that the maximum degree over all vertices is maximum\npossible. Make sure that the edges of the printed spanning tree form some\nsubset of the input edges (order doesn't matter and edge \n    (v, u)\n is\nconsidered the same as the edge \n    (u, v)\n). If there are multiple possible\nanswers, print any of them.

It is the\nmaximum degree over all vertices of the spanning tree. It is easy to see that\nwe cannot obtain a better answer. Picture corresponding to the second example:\nIn this example the number of edges of spanning tree incident to the vertex\n\n    1\n is \n    3\n. It is the maximum degree over all vertices of the spanning\ntree. It is easy to see that we cannot obtain a better answer. Picture\ncorresponding to the third example: In this example the number of edges of\nspanning tree incident to the vertex \n    2\n is \n    4\n. It is the maximum\ndegree over all vertices of the spanning tree. It is easy to see that we\ncannot obtain a better answer. But because this example is symmetric, we can\nchoose almost the same spanning tree but with vertex \n    5\n instead of\n\n    2\n.\n\n",
