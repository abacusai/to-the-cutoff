        "description": "Vasya has recently found out what a digital root of a number is and he decided\nto share his knowledge with you. Let's assume that S(n) is the sum of digits\nof number n, for example, S(4098) = 4 + 0 + 9 + 8 = 21. Then the digital root\nof number n equals to: dr(n) = S(n), if S(n) < 10; dr(n) = dr( S(n) ), if S(n)\n\u2265 10. For example, dr(4098) = dr(21) = 3. Vasya is afraid of large numbers, so\nthe numbers he works with are at most 10^1000. For all such numbers, he has\nproved that dr(n) = S( S( S( S(n) ) ) ) (n \u2264 10^1000). Now Vasya wants to\nquickly find numbers with the given digital root. The problem is, he hasn't\nlearned how to do that and he asked you to help him. You task is, given\nnumbers k and d, find the number consisting of exactly k digits (the leading\nzeroes are not allowed), with digital root equal to d, or else state that such\nnumber does not exist. Input The first line contains two integers k and d (1 \u2264\nk \u2264 1000; 0 \u2264 d \u2264 9). Output In a single line print either any number that\nmeets the requirements (without the leading zeroes) or \"No solution\" (without\nthe quotes), if the corresponding number does not exist. The chosen number\nmust consist of exactly k digits. We assume that number 0 doesn't contain any\nleading zeroes. Examples Input 4 4 Output 5881 Input 5 1 Output 36172 Input 1\n0 Output 0 Note For the first test sample dr(5881) = dr(22) = 4. For the\nsecond test sample dr(36172) = dr(19) = dr(10) = 1.\n\n",
