        "description": "Andryusha is an orderly boy and likes to keep things in their place. Today he\nfaced a problem to put his socks in the wardrobe. He has n distinct pairs of\nsocks which are initially in a bag. The pairs are numbered from 1 to n.\nAndryusha wants to put paired socks together and put them in the wardrobe. He\ntakes the socks one by one from the bag, and for each sock he looks whether\nthe pair of this sock has been already took out of the bag, or not. If not\n(that means the pair of this sock is still in the bag), he puts the current\nsocks on the table in front of him. Otherwise, he puts both socks from the\npair to the wardrobe. Andryusha remembers the order in which he took the socks\nfrom the bag. Can you tell him what is the maximum number of socks that were\non the table at the same time? Input The first line contains the single\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of sock pairs. The second line contains\n2n integers x1, x2, ..., x2n (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 n), which describe the order in which\nAndryusha took the socks from the bag. More precisely, xi means that the i-th\nsock Andryusha took out was from pair xi. It is guaranteed that Andryusha took\nexactly two socks of each pair. Output Print single integer \u2014 the maximum\nnumber of socks that were on the table at the same time. Examples Input 1 1 1\nOutput 1 Input 3 2 1 1 3 2 3 Output 2 Note In the first example Andryusha took\na sock from the first pair and put it on the table. Then he took the next sock\nwhich is from the first pair as well, so he immediately puts both socks to the\nwardrobe. Thus, at most one sock was on the table at the same time. In the\nsecond example Andryusha behaved as follows: Initially the table was empty, he\ntook out a sock from pair 2 and put it on the table. Sock (2) was on the\ntable. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 1 and put it on the table. Socks\n(1, 2) were on the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 1, and put this\npair into the wardrobe. Sock (2) was on the table. Andryusha took out a sock\nfrom pair 3 and put it on the table. Socks (2, 3) were on the table. Andryusha\ntook out a sock from pair 2, and put this pair into the wardrobe. Sock (3) was\non the table. Andryusha took out a sock from pair 3 and put this pair into the\nwardrobe. Thus, at most two socks were on the table at the same time.\n\n",
