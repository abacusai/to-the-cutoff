        "description": "After the contest in comparing numbers, Shapur's teacher found out that he is\na real genius and that no one could possibly do the calculations faster than\nhim even using a super computer! Some days before the contest, the teacher\ntook a very simple-looking exam and all his n students took part in the exam.\nThe teacher gave them 3 strings and asked them to concatenate them.\nConcatenating strings means to put them in some arbitrary order one after the\nother. For example from concatenating Alireza and Amir we can get to\nAlirezaAmir or AmirAlireza depending on the order of concatenation.\nUnfortunately enough, the teacher forgot to ask students to concatenate their\nstrings in a pre-defined order so each student did it the way he/she liked.\nNow the teacher knows that Shapur is such a fast-calculating genius boy and\nasks him to correct the students' papers. Shapur is not good at doing such a\ntime-taking task. He rather likes to finish up with it as soon as possible and\ntake his time to solve 3-SAT in polynomial time. Moreover, the teacher has\ngiven some advice that Shapur has to follow. Here's what the teacher said: As\nI expect you know, the strings I gave to my students (including you) contained\nonly lowercase and uppercase Persian Mikhi-Script letters. These letters are\ntoo much like Latin letters, so to make your task much harder I converted all\nthe initial strings and all of the students' answers to Latin. As latin\nalphabet has much less characters than Mikhi-Script, I added three odd-looking\ncharacters to the answers, these include \"-\", \";\" and \"_\". These characters\nare my own invention of course! And I call them Signs. The length of all\ninitial strings was less than or equal to 100 and the lengths of my students'\nanswers are less than or equal to 600 My son, not all students are genius as\nyou are. It is quite possible that they make minor mistakes changing case of\nsome characters. For example they may write ALiReZaAmIR instead of\nAlirezaAmir. Don't be picky and ignore these mistakes. Those signs which I\npreviously talked to you about are not important. You can ignore them, since\nmany students are in the mood for adding extra signs or forgetting about a\nsign. So something like Iran;;\u2013 is the same as \u2013;IRAN You should indicate\nfor any of my students if his answer was right or wrong. Do this by writing\n\"WA\" for Wrong answer or \"ACC\" for a correct answer. I should remind you that\nnone of the strings (initial strings or answers) are empty. Finally, do these\nas soon as possible. You have less than 2 hours to complete this. Input The\nfirst three lines contain a string each. These are the initial strings. They\nconsists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and\n\"_\"). All the initial strings have length from 1 to 100, inclusively. In the\nfourth line there is a single integer n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 1000), the number of\nstudents. Next n lines contain a student's answer each. It is guaranteed that\nthe answer meets what the teacher said. Each answer iconsists only of\nlowercase and uppercase Latin letters and signs (\"-\", \";\" and \"_\"). Length is\nfrom 1 to 600, inclusively. Output For each student write in a different line.\nPrint \"WA\" if his answer is wrong or \"ACC\" if his answer is OK.
