        "description": "You are given a sequence of \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n.\nYou have to construct two sequences of integers \n    b\n and \n    c\n with\nlength \n    n\n that satisfy: for every \n    i\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 i\n    \u2264 n\n)\n\n    b_i+c_i=a_i\n \n    b\n is non-decreasing, which means that for every\n\n    1<i\n    \u2264 n\n, \n    b_i\n    \u2265 b_i-1\n must hold \n    c\n is non-\nincreasing, which means that for every \n    1<i\n    \u2264 n\n, \n    c_i\n    \u2264\n    c_i-1\n must hold You have to minimize \n    max(b_i,c_i)\n. In other\nwords, you have to minimize the maximum number in sequences \n    b\n and\n\n    c\n. Also there will be \n    q\n changes, the \n    i\n-th change is\ndescribed by three integers \n    l,r,x\n. You should add \n    x\n to\n\n    a_l,a_l+1, \n    \u2026, a_r\n. You have to find the minimum possible value\nof \n    max(b_i,c_i)\n for the initial sequence and for sequence after each\nchange. Input The first line contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264\n    10^5\n). The secound line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 i\n    \u2264 n\n, \n    -10^9\n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264\n    10^9\n). The third line contains an integer \n    q\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 q\n    \u2264\n    10^5\n). Each of the next \n    q\n lines contains three integers \n    l,r,x\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 l\n    \u2264 r\n    \u2264 n,-10^9\n    \u2264 x\n    \u2264 10^9\n), desribing the next\nchange. Output Print \n    q+1\n lines. On the \n    i\n-th (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    q+1\n) line, print the answer to the problem for the sequence after \n    i-1\n\nchanges. Examples Input 4 2 -1 7 3 2 2 4 -3 3 4 2 Output 5 5 6 Input 6 -9 -10\n-9 -6 -5 4 3 2 6 -9 1 2 -10 4 6 -3 Output 3 3 3 1 Input 1 0 2 1 1 -1 1 1 -1\nOutput 0 0 -1 Note In the first test: The initial sequence \n    a = (2, -1, 7,\n    3)\n. Two sequences \n    b=(-3,-3,5,5),c=(5,2,2,-2)\n is a possible choice.\nAfter the first change \n    a = (2, -4, 4, 0)\n. Two sequences\n\n    b=(-3,-3,5,5),c=(5,-1,-1,-5)\n is a possible choice. After the second\nchange \n    a = (2, -4, 6, 2)\n. Two sequences \n    b=(-4,-4,6,6),c=(6,0,0,-4)\n\nis a possible choice.\n\n",
