        "description": "SmallR is a biologist. Her latest research finding is how to change the sex of\ndogs. In other words, she can change female dogs into male dogs and vice\nversa. She is going to demonstrate this technique. Now SmallR has n dogs, the\ncosts of each dog's change may be different. The dogs are numbered from 1 to\nn. The cost of change for dog i is vi RMB. By the way, this technique needs a\nkind of medicine which can be valid for only one day. So the experiment should\nbe taken in one day and each dog can be changed at most once. This experiment\nhas aroused extensive attention from all sectors of society. There are m rich\nfolks which are suspicious of this experiment. They all want to bet with\nSmallR forcibly. If SmallR succeeds, the i-th rich folk will pay SmallR wi\nRMB. But it's strange that they have a special method to determine whether\nSmallR succeeds. For i-th rich folk, in advance, he will appoint certain ki\ndogs and certain one gender. He will think SmallR succeeds if and only if on\nsome day the ki appointed dogs are all of the appointed gender. Otherwise, he\nwill think SmallR fails. If SmallR can't satisfy some folk that isn't her\nfriend, she need not pay him, but if someone she can't satisfy is her good\nfriend, she must pay g RMB to him as apologies for her fail. Then, SmallR hope\nto acquire money as much as possible by this experiment. Please figure out the\nmaximum money SmallR can acquire. By the way, it is possible that she can't\nobtain any money, even will lose money. Then, please give out the minimum\nmoney she should lose. Input The first line contains three integers n, m, g (1\n\u2264 n \u2264 10^4, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 2000, 0 \u2264 g \u2264 10^4). The second line contains n integers,\neach is 0 or 1, the sex of each dog, 0 represent the female and 1 represent\nthe male. The third line contains n integers v1, v2, ..., vn (0 \u2264 vi \u2264 10^4).\nEach of the next m lines describes a rich folk. On the i-th line the first\nnumber is the appointed sex of i-th folk (0 or 1), the next two integers are\nwi and ki (0 \u2264 wi \u2264 10^4, 1 \u2264 ki \u2264 10), next ki distinct integers are the\nindexes of appointed dogs (each index is between 1 and n). The last number of\nthis line represents whether i-th folk is SmallR's good friend (0 \u2014 no or 1 \u2014\nyes). Output Print a single integer, the maximum money SmallR can gain. Note\nthat the integer is negative if SmallR will lose money.
