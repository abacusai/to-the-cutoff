        "description": "A number \n    a_2\n is said to be the arithmetic mean of two numbers \n    a_1\n\nand \n    a_3\n, if the following condition holds: \n    a_1 + a_3 = 2\n    \u00b7\n    a_2\n. We define an arithmetic mean deviation of three numbers \n    a_1\n,\n\n    a_2\n and \n    a_3\n as follows: \n    d(a_1, a_2, a_3) = |a_1 + a_3 - 2\n    \n    \u00b7 a_2|\n. Arithmetic means a lot to Jeevan. He has three numbers\n\n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n and \n    a_3\n and he wants to minimize the arithmetic\nmean deviation \n    d(a_1, a_2, a_3)\n. To do so, he can perform the following\noperation any number of times (possibly zero): Choose \n    i, j\n from\n\n    1, 2, 3\n such that \n    i \n     j\n and increment \n    a_i\n by\n\n    1\n and decrement \n    a_j\n by \n    1\n Help Jeevan find out the minimum\nvalue of \n    d(a_1, a_2, a_3)\n that can be obtained after applying the\noperation any number of times. Input The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 5000)\n \u2014 the number of test cases. The first and\nonly line of each test case contains three integers \n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n and\n\n    a_3\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 a_1, a_2, a_3 \n    \u2264 10^8)\n. Output For each test\ncase, output the minimum value of \n    d(a_1, a_2, a_3)\n that can be obtained\nafter applying the operation any number of times. Example Input 3 3 4 5 2 2 6\n1 6 5 Output 0 1 0 Note Note that after applying a few operations, the values\nof \n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n and \n    a_3\n may become negative. In the first test\ncase, \n    4\n is already the Arithmetic Mean of \n    3\n and \n    5\n. \n    d(3,\n    4, 5) = |3 + 5 - 2 \n    \u00b7 4| = 0\n In the second test case, we can apply the\nfollowing operation: \n    (2, 2, 6)\n \n    \n \n    (1, 3, 6)\n \n    d(1, 3, 6) =\n    |1 + 6 - 2 \n    \u00b7 3| = 1\n It can be proven that answer can not be improved\nany further. In the third test case, we can apply the following operations:\n\n    (1, 6, 5)\n \n    \n \n    (1, 5, 6)\n\n\n    \n \n    (2, 4, 6)\n \n    d(2, 4, 6) = |2 + 6 - 2 \n    \u00b7 4| = 0\n\n\n",
