        "description": "Snow Queen told Kay to form a word \"eternity\" using pieces of ice. Kay is\neager to deal with the task, because he will then become free, and Snow Queen\nwill give him all the world and a pair of skates. Behind the palace of the\nSnow Queen there is an infinite field consisting of cells. There are n pieces\nof ice spread over the field, each piece occupying exactly one cell and no two\npieces occupying the same cell. To estimate the difficulty of the task Kay\nlooks at some squares of size k \u00d7 k cells, with corners located at the corners\nof the cells and sides parallel to coordinate axis and counts the number of\npieces of the ice inside them. This method gives an estimation of the\ndifficulty of some part of the field. However, Kay also wants to estimate the\ntotal difficulty, so he came up with the following criteria: for each x (1 \u2264 x\n\u2264 n) he wants to count the number of squares of size k \u00d7 k, such that there\nare exactly x pieces of the ice inside. Please, help Kay estimate the\ndifficulty of the task given by the Snow Queen. Input The first line of the\ninput contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 300) \u2014 the\nnumber of pieces of the ice and the value k, respectively. Each of the next n\nlines contains two integers xi and yi ( - 10^9 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 10^9) \u2014 coordinates\nof the cell containing i-th piece of the ice. It's guaranteed, that no two\npieces of the ice occupy the same cell. Output Print n integers: the number of\nsquares of size k \u00d7 k containing exactly 1, 2, ..., n pieces of the ice.\nExample Input 5 3 4 5 4 6 5 5 5 6 7 7 Output 10 8 1 4 0\n\n",
