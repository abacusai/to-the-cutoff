        "description": "This is an interactive problem. Misha likes to play cooperative games with\nincomplete information. Today he suggested ten his friends to play a\ncooperative game \"Lake\". Misha has already come up with a field for the\nupcoming game. The field for this game is a directed graph consisting of two\nparts. The first part is a road along the coast of the lake which is a cycle\nof \n    c\n vertices. The second part is a path from home to the lake which is\na chain of \n    t\n vertices, and there is an edge from the last vertex of this\nchain to the vertex of the road along the coast which has the most beautiful\nview of the lake, also known as the finish vertex. Misha decided to keep the\nfield secret, so nobody knows neither \n    t\n nor \n    c\n. Note that each\nvertex of the field has exactly one outgoing edge and all the vertices except\nthe home vertex and the finish vertex have exactly one ingoing edge. The home\nvertex has no incoming edges, the finish vertex has two incoming edges. At the\nbeginning of the game pieces of all the ten players, indexed with consecutive\nintegers from \n    0\n to \n    9\n, are at the home vertex. After that on each\nturn some of the players can ask Misha to simultaneously move their pieces\nalong the corresponding edges. Misha will not answer more than \n    q\n such\nqueries. After each move Misha will tell players whose pieces are at the same\nvertices and whose pieces are at different vertices. The goal of the game is\nto move all the pieces to the finish vertex. Misha's friends have no idea how\nto win in such a game without knowledge of \n    c\n, \n    t\n and \n    q\n, but\nluckily they are your friends. Help them: coordinate their actions to win the\ngame. Misha has drawn such a field that \n    1 \n    \u2264 t, c\n, \n    (t+c) \n    \u2264\n    1000\n and \n    q = 3 \n    \u00b7 (t+c)\n. Input There is no input \u2014 go to the\ninteraction part straight away. Output After all friends gather at the finish\nvertex, print \"done\" and terminate your program. Interaction To give a command\nto move the friends, print \"next\" and then space-separated indices of the\nfriends you want to move. For example, to give the command to move the friends\nwith indices \n    0\n, \n    2\n, \n    5\n and \n    9\n print \"next 0 2 5 9\". At\neach turn, you must move at least one of your friends. As an answer, first\nread an integer \n    k\n, and then \n    10\n digits divided into \n    k\n space-\nseparated groups. The friends that correspond to the indices in the same group\nare in the same vertex. The friends that correspond to indices in different\ngroups are in different vertices. The indices in each group follow in\nascending order. For example, the answer \"2 05 12346789\" means that the\nfriends with indices \n    0\n and \n    5\n are in one vertex, and all other\nfriends are in the same but different vertex. The answer \"4 01 567 234 89\"\nmeans that Misha's friends are in four different vertices: the friends with\nindices \n    0\n and \n    1\n are in the first, the friends with indices\n\n    5\n, \n    6\n and \n    7\n are in the second, the friends with indices\n\n    2\n, \n    3\n and \n    4\n are in the third, and the friends with indices\n\n    8\n and \n    9\n are in the fourth. After printing a query do not forget to\noutput end of line and flush the output. Otherwise you will get Idleness limit\nexceeded. To do this, use: fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\nSystem.out.flush() in Java; flush(output) in Pascal; stdout.flush() in Python;\nsee documentation for other languages. Answer \"stop\" instead of a valid one\nmeans that you made an invalid query. Exit immediately after receiving \"stop\"\nand you will see Wrong answer verdict. Otherwise you can get an arbitrary\nverdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed stream.\nHacks In order to hack, print two integers \n    t\n and \n    c\n in a single\nline (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t, c\n, \n    (t+c) \n    \u2264 1000\n). Example Input 2 05\n12346789 3 246789 135 0 3 246789 0 135 3 246789 0 135 2 135 0246789 1\n0123456789 Output next 0 5 next 0 1 3 next 2 3 0 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 next 9 8 7 6 5\n4 3 2 1 0 next 0 1 3 5 next 1 3 5 done Note In the sample input and output\nvalues are aligned only for simplicity of interpreting them chronologically.\nIn real interaction no \"extra\" line breaks should appear. In the example, the\nfriends move as follows:\n\n",
