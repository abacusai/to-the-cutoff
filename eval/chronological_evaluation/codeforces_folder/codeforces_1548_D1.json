        "description": "This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference from the hard\nversion is that in this version all coordinates are even. There are \n    n\n\nfence-posts at distinct coordinates on a plane. It is guaranteed that no three\nfence posts lie on the same line. There are an infinite number of cows on the\nplane, one at every point with integer coordinates. Gregor is a member of the\nIlluminati, and wants to build a triangular fence, connecting \n    3\n distinct\nexisting fence posts. A cow strictly inside the fence is said to be enclosed.\nIf there are an odd number of enclosed cows and the area of the fence is an\ninteger, the fence is said to be interesting. Find the number of interesting\nfences. Input The first line contains the integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    6000\n), the number of fence posts which Gregor can choose to form the\nvertices of a fence. Each of the next \n    n\n line contains two integers\n\n    x\n and \n    y\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x,y \n    \u2264 10^7\n, \n    x\n and \n    y\n are\neven), where \n    (x,y)\n is the coordinate of a fence post. All fence posts\nlie at distinct coordinates. No three fence posts are on the same line. Output\nPrint a single integer, the number of interesting fences. Two fences are\nconsidered different if they are constructed with a different set of three\nfence posts. Examples Input 3 0 0 2 0 0 4 Output 1 Input 5 0 0 2 16 30 14 4 6\n2 10 Output 3 Note In the first example, there is only \n    1\n fence. That\nfence is interesting since its area is \n    4\n and there is \n    1\n enclosed\ncow, marked in red. In the second example, there are \n    3\n interesting\nfences. \n    (0,0)\n \u2014 \n    (30,14)\n \u2014 \n    (2,10)\n \n    (2,16)\n \u2014\n\n    (30,14)\n \u2014 \n    (2,10)\n \n    (30,14)\n \u2014 \n    (4,6)\n \u2014 \n    (2,10)\n\n\n",
