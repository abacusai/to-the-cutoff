        "description": "Vika has decided to go on a trip to Bertown. She comes to Bertown on the\n\n    k\n-th day. Vika does not want to spend money on hotels, fortunately she\nhas \n    n\n friends who live in Bertown and allow Vika to stay at their\nhouses. The \n    i\n-th friend told Vika that she could stay at their house\nfrom the \n    l_i\n-th day till the \n    r_i\n-th day, inclusive. Vika decided\nthat she would stay at no more than one friend's house. Help Vika determine\nthe maximum number of days that she will be able to stay in Bertown. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 500\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, k \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of Vika's\nfriends and the day when Vika comes to Bertown. Then follow \n    n\n lines,\neach containing two integers \n    l_i\n and \n    r_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i\n    \n    \u2264 100\n) denoting the period when Vika can stay at the \n    i\n-th\nfriend's house. Output For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the\nmaximum number of days that Vika can stay in Bertown (or \n    0\n if none of\nVika's friends can host her on day \n    k\n). Example Input 3 3 3 1 4 2 6 4 10\n2 4 2 3 5 8 2 4 4 4 1 3 Output 4 0 1 Note In the first example, Vika can stay\nat the \n    2\n-nd friend's house from \n    3\n-rd to \n    6\n-th day. In the\nsecond example, none of Vika's friends can host her on the \n    4\n-th day. In\nthe third example, Vika can stay at the \n    1\n-st friend's house, but only\nfor the \n    4\n-th day.\n\n",
