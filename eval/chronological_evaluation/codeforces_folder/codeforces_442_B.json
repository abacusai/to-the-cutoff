        "description": "Andrey needs one more problem to conduct a programming contest. He has n\nfriends who are always willing to help. He can ask some of them to come up\nwith a contest problem. Andrey knows one value for each of his fiends \u2014 the\nprobability that this friend will come up with a problem if Andrey asks him.\nHelp Andrey choose people to ask. As he needs only one problem, Andrey is\ngoing to be really upset if no one comes up with a problem or if he gets more\nthan one problem from his friends. You need to choose such a set of people\nthat maximizes the chances of Andrey not getting upset. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of Andrey's friends.\nThe second line contains n real numbers pi (0.0 \u2264 pi \u2264 1.0) \u2014 the probability\nthat the i-th friend can come up with a problem. The probabilities are given\nwith at most 6 digits after decimal point. Output Print a single real number \u2014\nthe probability that Andrey won't get upset at the optimal choice of friends.\nThe answer will be considered valid if it differs from the correct one by at\nmost 10^-9. Examples Input 4 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.8 Output 0.800000000000 Input 2 0.1\n0.2 Output 0.260000000000 Note In the first sample the best strategy for\nAndrey is to ask only one of his friends, the most reliable one. In the second\nsample the best strategy for Andrey is to ask all of his friends to come up\nwith a problem. Then the probability that he will get exactly one problem is\n0.1\u00b70.8 + 0.9\u00b70.2 = 0.26.\n\n",
