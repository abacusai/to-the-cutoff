        "description": "The Smart Beaver from ABBYY started cooperating with the Ministry of Defence.\nNow they train soldiers to move armoured columns. The training involves\ntesting a new type of tanks that can transmit information. To test the new\ntype of tanks, the training has a special exercise, its essence is as follows.\nInitially, the column consists of n tanks sequentially numbered from 1 to n in\nthe order of position in the column from its beginning to its end. During the\nwhole exercise, exactly n messages must be transferred from the beginning of\nthe column to its end. Transferring one message is as follows. The tank that\ngoes first in the column transmits the message to some tank in the column. The\ntank which received the message sends it further down the column. The process\nis continued until the last tank receives the message. It is possible that not\nall tanks in the column will receive the message \u2014 it is important that the\nlast tank in the column should receive the message. After the last tank (tank\nnumber n) receives the message, it moves to the beginning of the column and\nsends another message to the end of the column in the same manner. When the\nmessage reaches the last tank (tank number n - 1), that tank moves to the\nbeginning of the column and sends the next message to the end of the column,\nand so on. Thus, the exercise is completed when the tanks in the column return\nto their original order, that is, immediately after tank number 1 moves to the\nbeginning of the column. If the tanks were initially placed in the column in\nthe order 1, 2, ..., n, then after the first message their order changes to n,\n1, ..., n - 1, after the second message it changes to n - 1, n, 1, ..., n - 2,\nand so on. The tanks are constructed in a very peculiar way. The tank with\nnumber i is characterized by one integer ai, which is called the message\nreceiving radius of this tank. Transferring a message between two tanks takes\none second, however, not always one tank can transmit a message to another\none. Let's consider two tanks in the column such that the first of them is the\ni-th in the column counting from the beginning, and the second one is the j-th\nin the column, and suppose the second tank has number x. Then the first tank\ncan transmit a message to the second tank if i < j and i \u2265 j - ax. The\nMinistry of Defense (and soon the Smart Beaver) faced the question of how to\norganize the training efficiently. The exercise should be finished as quickly\nas possible. We'll neglect the time that the tanks spend on moving along the\ncolumn, since improving the tanks' speed is not a priority for this training.\nYou are given the number of tanks, as well as the message receiving radii of\nall tanks. You must help the Smart Beaver and organize the transferring of\nmessages in a way that makes the total transmission time of all messages as\nsmall as possible. Input The first line contains integer n \u2014 the number of\ntanks in the column. Each of the next n lines contains one integer ai (1 \u2264 ai\n\u2264 250000, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) \u2014 the message receiving radii of the tanks in the order\nfrom tank 1 to tank n (let us remind you that initially the tanks are located\nin the column in ascending order of their numbers). To get the full points for\nthe first group of tests it is sufficient to solve the problem with 2 \u2264 n \u2264\n300. To get the full points for the second group of tests it is sufficient to\nsolve the problem with 2 \u2264 n \u2264 10000. To get the full points for the third\ngroup of tests it is sufficient to solve the problem with 2 \u2264 n \u2264 250000.\nOutput Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible total time of\ntransmitting the messages. Please, do not use the \nwrite 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or\nthe \n10 Note In the first sample the original order of tanks is 1, 2, 3. The first\ntank sends a message to the second one, then the second tank sends it to the\nthird one \u2014 it takes two seconds. The third tank moves to the beginning of the\ncolumn and the order of tanks now is 3, 1, 2. The third tank sends a message\nto the first one, then the first one sends it to the second one \u2014 it takes two\nmore seconds. The second tank moves to the beginning and the order of the\ntanks is now 2, 3, 1. With this arrangement, the second tank can immediately\nsend a message to the first one, since the message receiving radius of the\nfirst tank is large enough \u2014 it takes one second. Finally, the tanks return to\ntheir original order 1, 2, 3. In total, the exercise takes 5 seconds. In the\nsecond sample, all five tanks are the same and sending a single message takes\ntwo seconds, so in total the exercise takes 10 seconds.\n\n",
