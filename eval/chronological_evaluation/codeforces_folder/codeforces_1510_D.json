        "description": "Diana loves playing with numbers. She's got \n    n\n cards with positive\ninteger numbers \n    a_i\n written on them. She spends her free time\nmultiplying the numbers on the cards. She picks a non-empty subset of the\ncards and multiplies all the numbers \n    a_i\n written on them. Diana is happy\nwhen the product of the numbers ends with her favorite digit \n    d\n. Now she\nis curious what cards she should pick so that the product of the numbers on\nthem is the largest possible and the last decimal digit of the product is\n\n    d\n. Please, help her. Input The first line contains the integers \n    n\n\nand \n    d\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    0\n    \u2264 d\n    \u2264 9\n). The second line\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    a_i\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264 1000\n). Output On\nthe first line, print the number of chosen cards \n    k\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 k\n    \u2264\n    n\n). On the next line, print the numbers written on the chosen cards in any\norder. If it is impossible to choose a subset of cards with the product that\nends with the digit \n    d\n, print the single line with \n    -1\n. Examples\nInput 6 4 4 11 8 2 1 13 Output 5 1 2 4 11 13 Input 3 1 2 4 6 Output -1 Input 5\n7 1 3 1 5 3 Output -1 Input 6 3 8 9 4 17 11 5 Output 3 9 11 17 Input 5 6 2 2 2\n2 2 Output 4 2 2 2 2 Note In the first example, \n    1 \n    \u00d7 2 \n    \u00d7 4\n    \n    \u00d7 11 \n    \u00d7 13 = 1144\n, which is the largest product that ends with\nthe digit 4. The same set of cards without the number 1 is also a valid\nanswer, as well as a set of 8, 11, and 13 with or without 1 that also has the\nproduct of 1144. In the second example, all the numbers on the cards are even\nand their product cannot end with an odd digit 1. In the third example, the\nonly possible products are 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45, none of which end with the\ndigit 7. In the fourth example, \n    9 \n    \u00d7 11 \n    \u00d7 17 = 1683\n, which\nends with the digit 3. In the fifth example, \n    2 \n    \u00d7 2 \n    \u00d7 2\n    \n    \u00d7 2 = 16\n, which ends with the digit 6.\n\n",
