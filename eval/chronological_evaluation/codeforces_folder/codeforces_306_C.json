        "description": "Polycarpus is sure that his life fits the description: \"first there is a white\nstripe, then a black one, then a white one again\". So, Polycarpus is sure that\nthis rule is going to fulfill during the next n days. Polycarpus knows that he\nis in for w good events and b not-so-good events. At least one event is going\nto take place during each day. As each day is unequivocally characterizes as a\npart of a white or a black stripe, then each day is going to have events of\nthe same type only (ether good or not-so-good). What is the number of distinct\nways this scenario can develop over the next n days if Polycarpus is in for a\nwhite stripe (a stripe that has good events only, the stripe's length is at\nleast 1 day), the a black stripe (a stripe that has not-so-good events only,\nthe stripe's length is at least 1 day) and a white stripe again (a stripe that\nhas good events only, the stripe's length is at least 1 day). Each of n days\nwill belong to one of the three stripes only. Note that even the events of the\nsame type are distinct from each other. Even if some events occur on the same\nday, they go in some order (there are no simultaneous events). Write a code\nthat prints the number of possible configurations to sort the events into\ndays. See the samples for clarifications on which scenarios should be\nconsidered distinct. Print the answer modulo 1000000009 (10^9 + 9). Input The\nsingle line of the input contains integers n, w and b (3 \u2264 n \u2264 4000, 2 \u2264 w \u2264\n4000, 1 \u2264 b \u2264 4000) \u2014 the number of days, the number of good events and the\nnumber of not-so-good events. It is guaranteed that w + b \u2265 n. Output Print\nthe required number of ways modulo 1000000009 (10^9 + 9). Examples Input 3 2 1\nOutput 2 Input 4 2 2 Output 4 Input 3 2 2 Output 4 Note We'll represent the\ngood events by numbers starting from 1 and the not-so-good events \u2014 by letters\nstarting from 'a'. Vertical lines separate days. In the first sample the\npossible ways are: \"1|a|2\" and \"2|a|1\". In the second sample the possible ways\nare: \"1|a|b|2\", \"2|a|b|1\", \"1|b|a|2\" and \"2|b|a|1\". In the third sample the\npossible ways are: \"1|ab|2\", \"2|ab|1\", \"1|ba|2\" and \"2|ba|1\".\n\n",
