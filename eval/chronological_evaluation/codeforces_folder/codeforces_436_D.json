        "description": "Have you ever played Pudding Monsters? In this task, a simplified one-\ndimensional model of this game is used. Imagine an infinite checkered stripe,\nthe cells of which are numbered sequentially with integers. Some cells of the\nstrip have monsters, other cells of the strip are empty. All monsters are made\nof pudding, so if there are two monsters in the neighboring cells, they stick\nto each other (literally). Similarly, if several monsters are on consecutive\ncells, they all stick together in one block of monsters. We will call the\nstuck together monsters a block of monsters. A detached monster, not stuck to\nanyone else, is also considered a block. In one move, the player can take any\nblock of monsters and with a movement of his hand throw it to the left or to\nthe right. The selected monsters will slide on until they hit some other\nmonster (or a block of monsters). For example, if a strip has three monsters\nin cells 1, 4 and 5, then there are only four possible moves: to send a\nmonster in cell 1 to minus infinity, send the block of monsters in cells 4 and\n5 to plus infinity, throw monster 1 to the right (it will stop in cell 3),\nthrow a block of monsters in cells 4 and 5 to the left (they will stop in\ncells 2 and 3). Some cells on the strip are marked with stars. These are the\nspecial cells. The goal of the game is to make the largest possible number of\nspecial cells have monsters on them. You are given the numbers of the special\ncells on a strip as well as the initial position of all monsters. What is the\nmaximum number of special cells that will contain monsters in the optimal\ngame? Input The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5; 1 \u2264 m\n\u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of monsters on the strip and the number of special cells.\nThe second line contains n distinct integers \u2014 the numbers of the cells with\nmonsters, then the third line contains m distinct integers \u2014 the numbers of\nthe special cells. It is guaranteed that all the numbers of the cells are\npositive integers not exceeding 2\u00b710^5. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the\nmaximum number of special cells that will contain monsters in the optimal\ngame. Examples Input 3 2 1 3 5 2 4 Output 2 Input 4 2 1 3 4 6 2 5 Output 2\nInput 4 2 1 8 4 5 7 2 Output 1\n\n",
