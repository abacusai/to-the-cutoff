        "description": "Heidi enjoyed performing the simulation because she knew exactly when a new\nuniverse would be formed and where, and when a non-existent link would be\nbroken and where. However, the multiverse itself works in mysterious ways.\nWell, it works using probabilities, which to some people is mysterious. At\neach unit time, when a decision is made, one of the two events will happen\nrandomly. Let's denote \n    l\n as the current length of the multiverse. With a\nprobability of \n    p_create = 1 - \n    l/m\n, a universe will be\ncreated. With a probability of \n    p_break=\n    l/m\n, a non-existent\nlink will be broken at some position. More specifically, When a universe is\ncreated, it will manifest itself between any two adjacent universes or at one\nof the ends. Each position occurs with a probability of \n    1/l +\n    1\n. When a link is broken, it could be cut between any two adjacent\nuniverses, each with a probability of \n    1/l-1\n. After separating\nthe multiverse into two segments, the segment NOT containing the Doctor will\ncease to exist. As earlier, the Doctor remains in the same universe. However,\nif at some point the multiverse breaks in such a way that the Doctor finds\nhimself at the leftmost or rightmost end of it, the TARDIS stops functioning.\nIn such a case, the Doctor must actually walk across the multiverse to find\nthe tools to fix it. We are interested in the expected value of the length of\nthe multiverse when such an event occurs. Input The first and only line\ncontains three integers \n    n\n, \n    k\n and \n    m\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 250)\n, the initial length of the multiverse, the initial\nposition of the Doctor, and the maximum possible length of the multiverse.\nOutput Output a single integer on a single line, indicating the expected\nlength of the multiverse. If the answer is \n    p/q\n, please print\n\n    r\n where \n    p \n    \u2261 r \n    \u00b7 q (\n    mod  10^9 + 7)\n. Examples\nInput 2 1 2 Output 2 Input 2 2 10 Output 2 Input 3 2 3 Output 2 Input 3 2 5\nOutput 941659828 Input 10 4 20 Output 196683114 Note For the first and the\nsecond test case, without any change to the multiverse, the Doctor is already\nat one of the ends. For the third test case, the multiverse can only break at\na position, which renders the Doctor at one of its ends. For the fourth case,\nthings seem to be a little more complicated, because the multiverse can grow\nand then be broken again.\n\n",
