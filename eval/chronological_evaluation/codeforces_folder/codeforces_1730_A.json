        "description": "One day, Vogons wanted to build a new hyperspace highway through a distant\nsystem with \n    n\n planets. The \n    i\n-th planet is on the orbit \n    a_i\n,\nthere could be multiple planets on the same orbit. It's a pity that all the\nplanets are on the way and need to be destructed. Vogons have two machines to\ndo that. The first machine in one operation can destroy any planet at cost of\n\n    1\n Triganic Pu. The second machine in one operation can destroy all\nplanets on a single orbit in this system at the cost of \n    c\n Triganic Pus.\nVogons can use each machine as many times as they want. Vogons are very\ngreedy, so they want to destroy all planets with minimum amount of money\nspent. Can you help them to know the minimum cost of this project? Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of\ntwo lines. The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    c\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n, c \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of planets and the cost of the second\nmachine usage. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 100\n), where \n    a_i\n is the orbit of the\n\n    i\n-th planet. Output For each test case print a single integer \u2014 the\nminimum cost of destroying all planets. Examples Input 4 10 1 2 1 4 5 2 4 5 5\n1 2 5 2 3 2 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 Output 4 4 2 2 Input 1 1 100 1 Output 1 Note\nIn the first test case, the cost of using both machines is the same, so you\ncan always use the second one and destroy all planets in orbit \n    1\n, all\nplanets in orbit \n    2\n, all planets in orbit \n    4\n, all planets in orbit\n\n    5\n. In the second test case, it is advantageous to use the second machine\nfor \n    2\n Triganic Pus to destroy all the planets in orbit \n    2\n, then\ndestroy the remaining two planets using the first machine. In the third test\ncase, you can use the first machine twice or the second machine once. In the\nfourth test case, it is advantageous to use the first machine twice.\n\n",
