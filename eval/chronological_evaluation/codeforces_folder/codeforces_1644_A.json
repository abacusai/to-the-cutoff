        "description": "The knight is standing in front of a long and narrow hallway. A princess is\nwaiting at the end of it. In a hallway there are three doors: a red door, a\ngreen door and a blue door. The doors are placed one after another, however,\npossibly in a different order. To proceed to the next door, the knight must\nfirst open the door before. Each door can be only opened with a key of the\ncorresponding color. So three keys: a red key, a green key and a blue key \u2014\nare also placed somewhere in the hallway. To open the door, the knight should\nfirst pick up the key of its color. The knight has a map of the hallway. It\ncan be transcribed as a string, consisting of six characters: R, G, B \u2014\ndenoting red, green and blue doors, respectively; r, g, b \u2014 denoting red,\ngreen and blue keys, respectively. Each of these six characters appears in the\nstring exactly once. The knight is standing at the beginning of the hallway \u2014\non the left on the map. Given a map of the hallway, determine if the knight\ncan open all doors and meet the princess at the end of the hallway. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 720\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of testcases. Each testcase consists of a single string. Each character\nis one of R, G, B (for the doors), r, g, b (for the keys), and each of them\nappears exactly once. Output For each testcase, print YES if the knight can\nopen all doors. Otherwise, print NO. Example Input 4 rgbBRG RgbrBG bBrRgG\nrgRGBb Output YES NO YES NO Note In the first testcase, the knight first\ncollects all keys, then opens all doors with them. In the second testcase,\nthere is a red door right in front of the knight, but he doesn't have a key\nfor it. In the third testcase, the key to each door is in front of each\nrespective door, so the knight collects the key and uses it immediately three\ntimes. In the fourth testcase, the knight can't open the blue door.\n\n",
