        "description": "A bow adorned with nameless flowers that bears the earnest hopes of an equally\nnameless person. You have obtained the elegant bow known as the Windblume Ode.\nInscribed in the weapon is an array of \n    n\n (\n    n \n    \u2265 3\n) positive\ndistinct integers (i.e. different, no duplicates are allowed). Find the\nlargest subset (i.e. having the maximum number of elements) of this array such\nthat its sum is a composite number. A positive integer \n    x\n is called\ncomposite if there exists a positive integer \n    y\n such that \n    1 < y < x\n\nand \n    x\n is divisible by \n    y\n. If there are multiple subsets with this\nlargest size with the composite sum, you can output any of them. It can be\nproven that under the constraints of the problem such a non-empty subset\nalways exists. Input Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n).\nDescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains an integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the length of the\narray. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n distinct integers\n\n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the\nelements of the array. Output Each test case should have two lines of output.\nThe first line should contain a single integer \n    x\n: the size of the\nlargest subset with composite sum. The next line should contain \n    x\n space\nseparated integers representing the indices of the subset of the initial\narray. Example Input 4 3 8 1 2 4 6 9 4 2 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 3 200 199 198\nOutput 2 2 1 4 2 1 4 3 9 6 9 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 3 1 2 3 Note In the first test\ncase, the subset \n    a_2, a_1\n has a sum of \n    9\n, which is a\ncomposite number. The only subset of size \n    3\n has a prime sum equal to\n\n    11\n. Note that you could also have selected the subset \n    a_1,\n    a_3\n with sum \n    8 + 2 = 10\n, which is composite as it's divisible by\n\n    2\n. In the second test case, the sum of all elements equals to \n    21\n,\nwhich is a composite number. Here we simply take the whole array as our\nsubset.\n\n",
