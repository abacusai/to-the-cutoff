        "description": "Vasily has recently learned about the amazing properties of number \u03c0. In one\nof the articles it has been hypothesized that, whatever the sequence of\nnumbers we have, in some position, this sequence is found among the digits of\nnumber \u03c0. Thus, if you take, for example, the epic novel \"War and Peace\" of\nfamous Russian author Leo Tolstoy, and encode it with numbers, then we will\nfind the novel among the characters of number \u03c0. Vasily was absolutely\ndelighted with this, because it means that all the books, songs and programs\nhave already been written and encoded in the digits of \u03c0. Vasily is, of\ncourse, a bit wary that this is only a hypothesis and it hasn't been proved,\nso he decided to check it out. To do this, Vasily downloaded from the Internet\nthe archive with the sequence of digits of number \u03c0, starting with a certain\nposition, and began to check the different strings of digits on the presence\nin the downloaded archive. Vasily quickly found short strings of digits, but\neach time he took a longer string, it turned out that it is not in the\narchive. Vasily came up with a definition that a string of length d is a half-\noccurrence if it contains a substring of length of at least , which occurs in\nthe archive. To complete the investigation, Vasily took 2 large numbers x, y\n(x \u2264 y) with the same number of digits and now he wants to find the number of\nnumbers in the interval from x to y, which are half-occurrences in the\narchive. Help Vasily calculate this value modulo 10^9 + 7. Input The first\nline contains string s consisting of decimal digits (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 1000) that\nVasily will use to search substrings in. According to hypothesis, this\nsequence of digis indeed occurs in the decimal representation of \u03c0, although\nwe can't guarantee that. The second and third lines contain two positive\nintegers x, y of the same length d (x \u2264 y, 2 \u2264 d \u2264 50). Numbers x, y do not\ncontain leading zeroes. Output Print how many numbers in the segment from x to\ny that are half-occurrences in s modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input 02 10 19\nOutput 2 Input 023456789 10 19 Output 9 Input 31415926535 10 29 Output 20\n\n",
