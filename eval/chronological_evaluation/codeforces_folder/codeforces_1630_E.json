        "description": "Given a cyclic array \n    a\n of size \n    n\n, where \n    a_i\n is the value of\n\n    a\n in the \n    i\n-th position, there may be repeated values. Let us\ndefine that a permutation of \n    a\n is equal to another permutation of\n\n    a\n if and only if their values are the same for each position \n    i\n or\nwe can transform them to each other by performing some cyclic rotation. Let us\ndefine for a cyclic array \n    b\n its number of components as the number of\nconnected components in a graph, where the vertices are the positions of\n\n    b\n and we add an edge between each pair of adjacent positions of \n    b\n\nwith equal values (note that in a cyclic array the first and last position are\nalso adjacents). Find the expected value of components of a permutation of\n\n    a\n if we select it equiprobably over the set of all the different\npermutations of \n    a\n. Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first\nline of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^6\n) \u2014 the size of the cyclic array \n    a\n. The second line of each test\ncase contains \n    n\n integers, the \n    i\n-th of them is the value \n    a_i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    10^6\n. It is guaranteed that the total number\nof different permutations of \n    a\n is not divisible by \n    M\n Output For\neach test case print a single integer \u2014 the expected value of components of a\npermutation of \n    a\n if we select it equiprobably over the set of all the\ndifferent permutations of \n    a\n modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Formally,\nlet \n    M = 998\n     244\n     353\n. It can be shown that the answer can be\nexpressed as an irreducible fraction \n    p/q\n, where \n    p\n and\n\n    q\n are integers and \n    q \n    \u2261 0 \n    M\n. Output the\ninteger equal to \n    p \n    \u00b7 q^-1\n     M\n. In other words, output such\nan integer \n    x\n that \n    0 \n    \u2264 x < M\n and \n    x \n    \u00b7 q \n    \u2261 p\n    \n    M\n.

Therefore the expected value of components is\n\n    1/1 = 1\n In the second test case there are \n    4\n ways to\npermute the cyclic array \n    a\n, but there is only \n    1\n different\npermutation of \n    a\n: \n    [1, 1, 1, 2]\n, \n    [1, 1, 2, 1]\n, \n    [1, 2, 1,\n    1]\n and \n    [2, 1, 1, 1]\n are the same permutation and have \n    2\n\ncomponents. Therefore the expected value of components is \n    2/1 =\n    2\n In the third test case there are \n    6\n ways to permute the cyclic array\n\n    a\n, but there are only \n    2\n different permutations of \n    a\n: \n    [1,\n    1, 2, 2]\n, \n    [2, 1, 1, 2]\n, \n    [2, 2, 1, 1]\n and \n    [1, 2, 2, 1]\n are\nthe same permutation and have \n    2\n components. \n    [1, 2, 1, 2]\n and\n\n    [2, 1, 2, 1]\n are the same permutation and have \n    4\n components.\nTherefore the expected value of components is \n    2+4/2 =\n    \n    6/2 = 3\n In the fourth test case there are \n    120\n ways to\npermute the cyclic array \n    a\n, but there are only \n    24\n different\npermutations of \n    a\n: Any permutation of \n    a\n has \n    5\n components.\nTherefore the expected value of components is \n    24\n    \u00b7 5/24 =\n    \n    120/24 = 5\n\n\n",
