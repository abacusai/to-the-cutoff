        "description": "Today, like every year at SWERC, the \n    n^2\n contestants have gathered\noutside the venue to take a drone photo. Jennifer, the social media manager\nfor the event, has arranged them into an \n    n\n    \u00d7 n\n square. Being very\ngood at her job, she knows that the contestant standing on the intersection of\nthe \n    i\n-th row with the \n    j\n-th column is \n    a_i,j\n years old.\nCoincidentally, she notices that no two contestants have the same age, and\nthat everyone is between \n    1\n and \n    n^2\n years old. Jennifer is planning\nto have some contestants hold a banner with the ICPC logo parallel to the\nground, so that it is clearly visible in the aerial picture. Here are the\nsteps that she is going to follow in order to take the perfect SWERC drone\nphoto. First of all, Jennifer is going to select four contestants standing on\nthe vertices of an axis-aligned rectangle. Then, she will have the two younger\ncontestants hold one of the poles, while the two older contestants will hold\nthe other pole. Finally, she will unfold the banner, using the poles to\nsupport its two ends. Obviously, this can only be done if the two poles are\nparallel and do not cross, as shown in the pictures below. Being very\nindecisive, Jennifer would like to try out all possible arrangements for the\nbanner, but she is worried that this may cause the contestants to be late for\nthe competition. How many different ways are there to choose the four\ncontestants holding the poles in order to take a perfect photo? Two choices\nare considered different if at least one contestant is included in one but not\nthe other. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 1500\n). The next \n    n\n lines describe the ages of the contestants.\nSpecifically, the \n    i\n-th line contains the integers\n\n    a_i,1,a_i,2,\n    \u2026,a_i,n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 a_i,j\n    \u2264 n^2\n). It is\nguaranteed that \n    a_i,j\n    \u2260 a_k,l\n if \n    i\n    \u2260 k\n or \n    j\n    \u2260\n    l\n. Output Print the number of ways for Jennifer to choose the four\ncontestants holding the poles. Examples Input 2 1 3 4 2 Output 0 Input 2 3 2 4\n1 Output 1 Input 3 9 2 4 1 5 3 7 8 6 Output 6 Note In the first sample, there\nare \n    4\n contestants, arranged as follows. There is only one way to choose\nfour contestants, with one pole held by contestants aged \n    1\n and \n    2\n\nand the other one by contestants aged \n    3\n and \n    4\n. But then, as we can\nsee in the picture, the poles cross. Since there is no valid way to choose\nfour contestants, the answer is \n    0\n. In the second sample, the \n    4\n\ncontestants are arranged as follows. Once again, there is only one way to\nchoose four contestants, but this time the poles don't cross. Therefore, the\nanswer is \n    1\n. In the third sample, the \n    9\n contestants are arranged\nas follows. There are \n    6\n ways of choosing four contestants so that the\npoles don't cross, as shown in the following pictures.\n\n",
