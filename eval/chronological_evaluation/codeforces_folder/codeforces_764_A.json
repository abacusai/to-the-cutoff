        "description": "Comrade Dujikov is busy choosing artists for Timofey's birthday and is\nrecieving calls from Taymyr from Ilia-alpinist. Ilia-alpinist calls every n\nminutes, i.e. in minutes n, 2n, 3n and so on. Artists come to the comrade\nevery m minutes, i.e. in minutes m, 2m, 3m and so on. The day is z minutes\nlong, i.e. the day consists of minutes 1, 2, ..., z. How many artists should\nbe killed so that there are no artists in the room when Ilia calls? Consider\nthat a call and a talk with an artist take exactly one minute. Input The only\nstring contains three integers \u2014 n, m and z (1 \u2264 n, m, z \u2264 10^4). Output Print\nsingle integer \u2014 the minimum number of artists that should be killed so that\nthere are no artists in the room when Ilia calls. Examples Input 1 1 10 Output\n10 Input 1 2 5 Output 2 Input 2 3 9 Output 1 Note Taymyr is a place in the\nnorth of Russia. In the first test the artists come each minute, as well as\nthe calls, so we need to kill all of them. In the second test we need to kill\nartists which come on the second and the fourth minutes. In the third test \u2014\nonly the artist which comes on the sixth minute.\n\n",
