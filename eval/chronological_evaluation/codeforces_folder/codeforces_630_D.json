        "description": "After a probationary period in the game development company of IT City Petya\nwas included in a group of the programmers that develops a new turn-based\nstrategy game resembling the well known \"Heroes of Might     Magic\". A part of\nthe game is turn-based fights of big squadrons of enemies on infinite fields\nwhere every cell is in form of a hexagon. Some of magic effects are able to\naffect several field cells at once, cells that are situated not farther than n\ncells away from the cell in which the effect was applied. The distance between\ncells is the minimum number of cell border crosses on a path from one cell to\nanother. It is easy to see that the number of cells affected by a magic effect\ngrows rapidly when n increases, so it can adversely affect the game\nperformance. That's why Petya decided to write a program that can, given n,\ndetermine the number of cells that should be repainted after effect\napplication, so that game designers can balance scale of the effects and the\ngame performance. Help him to do it. Find the number of hexagons situated not\nfarther than n cells away from a given cell. Input The only line of the input\ncontains one integer n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9). Output Output one integer \u2014 the number\nof hexagons situated not farther than n cells away from a given cell. Examples\nInput 2 Output 19\n\n",
