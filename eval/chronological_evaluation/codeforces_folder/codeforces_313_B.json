        "description": "Ilya the Lion wants to help all his friends with passing exams. They need to\nsolve the following problem to pass the IT exam. You've got string s = s1s2...\nsn (n is the length of the string), consisting only of characters \".\" and \"#\"\nand m queries. Each query is described by a pair of integers li, ri (1 \u2264 li <\nri \u2264 n). The answer to the query li, ri is the number of such integers i (li \u2264\ni < ri), that si = si + 1. Ilya the Lion wants to help his friends but is\nthere anyone to help him? Help Ilya, solve the problem. Input The first line\ncontains string s of length n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). It is guaranteed that the given\nstring only consists of characters \".\" and \"#\". The next line contains integer\nm (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries. Each of the next m lines contains\nthe description of the corresponding query. The i-th line contains integers\nli, ri (1 \u2264 li < ri \u2264 n). Output Print m integers \u2014 the answers to the queries\nin the order in which they are given in the input. Examples Input ...... 4 3 4\n2 3 1 6 2 6 Output 1 1 5 4 Input #..### 5 1 3 5 6 1 5 3 6 3 4 Output 1 1 2 2 0\n\n",
