        "description": "The presidential election is coming in Bearland next year! Everybody is so\nexcited about this! So far, there are three candidates, Alice, Bob, and\nCharlie. There are n citizens in Bearland. The election result will determine\nthe life of all citizens of Bearland for many years. Because of this great\nresponsibility, each of n citizens will choose one of six orders of preference\nbetween Alice, Bob and Charlie uniformly at random, independently from other\nvoters. The government of Bearland has devised a function to help determine\nthe outcome of the election given the voters preferences. More specifically,\nthe function is (takes n boolean numbers and returns a boolean number). The\nfunction also obeys the following property: f(1 - x1, 1 - x2, ..., 1 - xn) = 1\n- f(x1, x2, ..., xn). Three rounds will be run between each pair of\ncandidates: Alice and Bob, Bob and Charlie, Charlie and Alice. In each round,\nxi will be equal to 1, if i-th citizen prefers the first candidate to second\nin this round, and 0 otherwise. After this, y = f(x1, x2, ..., xn) will be\ncalculated. If y = 1, the first candidate will be declared as winner in this\nround. If y = 0, the second will be the winner, respectively. Define the\nprobability that there is a candidate who won two rounds as p. p\u00b76^n is always\nan integer. Print the value of this integer modulo 10^9 + 7 = 1 000 000 007.\nInput The first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 20). The next line\ncontains a string of length 2^n of zeros and ones, representing function f.\nLet bk(x) the k-th bit in binary representation of x, i-th (0-based) digit of\nthis string shows the return value of f(b1(i), b2(i), ..., bn(i)). It is\nguaranteed that f(1 - x1, 1 - x2, ..., 1 - xn) = 1 - f(x1, x2, ..., xn) for\nany values of x1, x2, ldots, xn. Output Output one integer \u2014 answer to the\nproblem. Examples Input 3 01010101 Output 216 Input 3 01101001 Output 168 Note\nIn first sample, result is always fully determined by the first voter. In\nother words, f(x1, x2, x3) = x1. Thus, any no matter what happens, there will\nbe a candidate who won two rounds (more specifically, the candidate who is at\nthe top of voter 1's preference list), so p = 1, and we print 1\u00b76^3 = 216.\n\n",
