        "description": "A substring is a continuous and non-empty segment of letters from a given\nstring, without any reorders. An even palindrome is a string that reads the\nsame backward as forward and has an even length. For example, strings \"zz\",\n\"abba\", \"abccba\" are even palindromes, but strings \"codeforces\", \"reality\",\n\"aba\", \"c\" are not. A beautiful string is an even palindrome or a string that\ncan be partitioned into some smaller even palindromes. You are given a string\n\n    s\n, consisting of \n    n\n lowercase Latin letters. Count the number of\nbeautiful substrings of \n    s\n. Input Each test contains multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each\ntest case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5\n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n). The second line of each test case contains a string \n    s\n. String\n\n    s\n consists of only lowercase Latin letters and has a length of \n    n\n.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    5\n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case print the number of beautiful\nsubstrings. Example Input 6 6 abaaba 1 a 2 aa 6 abcdef 12 accabccbacca 6\nabbaaa Output 3 0 1 0 14 6 Note In the first test case, the beautiful\nsubstrings are \"abaaba\", \"baab\", \"aa\". In the last test case, the beautiful\nsubstrings are \"aa\" (counted twice), \"abba\", \"bb\", \"bbaa\", \"abbaaa\".\n\n",
