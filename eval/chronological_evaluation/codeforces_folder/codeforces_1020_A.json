        "description": "You are looking at the floor plan of the Summer Informatics School's new\nbuilding. You were tasked with SIS logistics, so you really care about travel\ntime between different locations: it is important to know how long it would\ntake to get from the lecture room to the canteen, or from the gym to the\nserver room. The building consists of n towers, h floors each, where the\ntowers are labeled from 1 to n, the floors are labeled from 1 to h. There is a\npassage between any two adjacent towers (two towers i and i + 1 for all i: 1 \u2264\ni \u2264 n - 1) on every floor x, where a \u2264 x \u2264 b. It takes exactly one minute to\nwalk between any two adjacent floors of a tower, as well as between any two\nadjacent towers, provided that there is a passage on that floor. It is not\npermitted to leave the building. The picture illustrates the first example.\nYou have given k pairs of locations (ta, fa), (tb, fb): floor fa of tower ta\nand floor fb of tower tb. For each pair you need to determine the minimum\nwalking time between these locations. Input The first line of the input\ncontains following integers: n: the number of towers in the building (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n10^8), h: the number of floors in each tower (1 \u2264 h \u2264 10^8), a and b: the\nlowest and highest floor where it's possible to move between adjacent towers\n(1 \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 h), k: total number of queries (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^4). Next k lines\ncontain description of the queries. Each description consists of four integers\nta, fa, tb, fb (1 \u2264 ta, tb \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 fa, fb \u2264 h). This corresponds to a query\nto find the minimum travel time between fa-th floor of the ta-th tower and fb-\nth floor of the tb-th tower. Output For each query print a single integer: the\nminimum walking time between the locations in minutes. Example Input 3 6 2 3 3\n1 2 1 3 1 4 3 4 1 2 2 3 Output 1 4 2\n\n",
