        "name": "Mister B and Beacons on Field",
        "description": "Mister B has a house in the middle of a giant plain field, which attracted\naliens life. For convenience, aliens specified the Cartesian coordinate system\non the field in such a way that Mister B's house has coordinates (0, 0). After\nthat they sent three beacons to the field, but something went wrong. One\nbeacon was completely destroyed, while the other two landed in positions with\ncoordinates (m, 0) and (0, n), respectively, but shut down. Mister B was\ninterested in this devices, so he decided to take them home. He came to the\nfirst beacon, placed at (m, 0), lifted it up and carried the beacon home\nchoosing the shortest path. After that he came to the other beacon, placed at\n(0, n), and also carried it home choosing the shortest path. When first beacon\nwas lifted up, the navigation system of the beacons was activated. Partially\ndestroyed navigation system started to work in following way. At time moments\nwhen both survived beacons are at points with integer coordinates the system\ntries to find a location for the third beacon. It succeeds if and only if\nthere is a point with integer coordinates such that the area of the triangle\nformed by the two survived beacons and this point is equal to s. In this case\nthe system sends a packet of information with beacon positions to aliens,\notherwise it doesn't. Compute how many packets of information system sent\nwhile Mister B was moving the beacons. Input The first line contains one\ninteger t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next 3\u00b7t lines\ndescribe t test cases. Every test case is described in three lines as follows.\nNote that each parameter is given as a product of three factors. The first\nline of a test case contains three space-separated integers: n1, n2, n3 (1 \u2264\nni \u2264 10^6) such that n = n1\u00b7n2\u00b7n3. The second line contains three space-\nseparated integers: m1, m2, m3 (1 \u2264 mi \u2264 10^6) such that m = m1\u00b7m2\u00b7m3. The\nthird line contains three space-separated integers: s1, s2, s3 (1 \u2264 si \u2264 10^6)\nsuch that s = s1\u00b7s2\u00b7s3. Note that for hacks only tests with t = 1 allowed.\nOutput Print t integers one per line \u2014 the answers for each test. Example\nInput 3 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 3 1 5 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 10 6 18 2 103 2 13 1 13 Output 4 7\n171 Note First test case contains the following beacon positions: (2, 0) and\n(0, 2), s = 3. The following packets could be sent: ((2, 0), (0, 2), ( - 1,\n0)), ((1, 0), (0, 2), (4, 0)), ((0, 0), (0, 2), (3, 1)), ((0, 0), (0, 1), ( -\n6, 0)), where (b1, b2, p) has next description: b1 \u2014 first beacon position, b2\n\u2014 second beacon position, p \u2014 some generated point. Second test case contains\nthe following beacon initial positions: (4, 0) and (0, 5), s = 2. The\nfollowing packets could be sent: ((4, 0), (0, 5), (0, 4)), ((3, 0), (0, 5),\n(2, 3)), ((2, 0), (0, 5), (2, 2)), ((1, 0), (0, 5), (1, 4)), ((0, 0), (0, 4),\n(0, - 1)), ((0, 0), (0, 2), (2, 0)), ((0, 0), (0, 1), (4, 0)).\n\n",
