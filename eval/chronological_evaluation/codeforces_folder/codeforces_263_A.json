        "description": "You've got a 5 \u00d7 5 matrix, consisting of 24 zeroes and a single number one.\nLet's index the matrix rows by numbers from 1 to 5 from top to bottom, let's\nindex the matrix columns by numbers from 1 to 5 from left to right. In one\nmove, you are allowed to apply one of the two following transformations to the\nmatrix: Swap two neighboring matrix rows, that is, rows with indexes i and i +\n1 for some integer i (1 \u2264 i < 5). Swap two neighboring matrix columns, that\nis, columns with indexes j and j + 1 for some integer j (1 \u2264 j < 5). You think\nthat a matrix looks beautiful, if the single number one of the matrix is\nlocated in its middle (in the cell that is on the intersection of the third\nrow and the third column). Count the minimum number of moves needed to make\nthe matrix beautiful. Input The input consists of five lines, each line\ncontains five integers: the j-th integer in the i-th line of the input\nrepresents the element of the matrix that is located on the intersection of\nthe i-th row and the j-th column. It is guaranteed that the matrix consists of\n24 zeroes and a single number one. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum\nnumber of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.
