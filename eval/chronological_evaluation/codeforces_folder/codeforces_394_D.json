        "description": "The Physical education teacher at SESC is a sort of mathematician too. His\nmost favorite topic in mathematics is progressions. That is why the teacher\nwants the students lined up in non-decreasing height form an arithmetic\nprogression. To achieve the goal, the gym teacher ordered a lot of magical\nbuns from the dining room. The magic buns come in two types: when a student\neats one magic bun of the first type, his height increases by one, when the\nstudent eats one magical bun of the second type, his height decreases by one.\nThe physical education teacher, as expected, cares about the health of his\nstudents, so he does not want them to eat a lot of buns. More precisely, he\nwants the maximum number of buns eaten by some student to be minimum. Help the\nteacher, get the maximum number of buns that some pupils will have to eat to\nachieve the goal of the teacher. Also, get one of the possible ways for\nachieving the objective, namely, the height of the lowest student in the end\nand the step of the resulting progression. Input The single line contains\ninteger n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^3) \u2014 the number of students. The second line contains n\nspace-separated integers \u2014 the heights of all students. The height of one\nstudent is an integer which absolute value doesn't exceed 10^4. Output In the\nfirst line print the maximum number of buns eaten by some student to achieve\nthe teacher's aim. In the second line, print two space-separated integers \u2014\nthe height of the lowest student in the end and the step of the progression.\nPlease, pay attention that the step should be non-negative. If there are\nmultiple possible answers, you can print any of them. Examples Input 5 -3 -4\n-2 -3 3 Output 2 -3 1 Input 5 2 -3 -1 -4 3 Output 1 -4 2 Note Lets look at the\nfirst sample. We can proceed in the following manner: don't feed the 1-st\nstudent, his height will stay equal to -3; give two buns of the first type to\nthe 2-nd student, his height become equal to -2; give two buns of the first\ntype to the 3-rd student, his height become equal to 0; give two buns of the\nfirst type to the 4-th student, his height become equal to -1; give two buns\nof the second type to the 5-th student, his height become equal to 1. To sum\nit up, when the students line up in non-decreasing height it will be an\narithmetic progression: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1. The height of the lowest student is\nequal to -3, the step of the progression is equal to 1. The maximum number of\nbuns eaten by one student is equal to 2.\n\n",
