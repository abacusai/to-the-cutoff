        "name": "Case of Chocolate",
        "description": "Andrewid the Android is a galaxy-known detective. Now he does not investigate\nany case and is eating chocolate out of boredom. A bar of chocolate can be\npresented as an n \u00d7 n table, where each cell represents one piece of\nchocolate. The columns of the table are numbered from 1 to n from left to\nright and the rows are numbered from top to bottom. Let's call the anti-\ndiagonal to be a diagonal that goes the lower left corner to the upper right\ncorner of the table. First Andrewid eats all the pieces lying below the anti-\ndiagonal. Then he performs the following q actions with the remaining\ntriangular part: first, he chooses a piece on the anti-diagonal and either\ndirection 'up' or 'left', and then he begins to eat all the pieces starting\nfrom the selected cell, moving in the selected direction until he reaches the\nalready eaten piece or chocolate bar edge. After each action, he wants to know\nhow many pieces he ate as a result of this action. Input The first line\ncontains integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9) and q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the size of the\nchocolate bar and the number of actions. Next q lines contain the descriptions\nof the actions: the i-th of them contains numbers xi and yi (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 n,\nxi + yi = n + 1) \u2014 the numbers of the column and row of the chosen cell and\nthe character that represents the direction (L \u2014 left, U \u2014 up). Output Print q\nlines, the i-th of them should contain the number of eaten pieces as a result\nof the i-th action. Examples Input 6 5 3 4 U 6 1 L 2 5 L 1 6 U 4 3 U Output 4\n3 2 1 2 Input 10 6 2 9 U 10 1 U 1 10 U 8 3 L 10 1 L 6 5 U Output 9 1 10 6 0 2\nNote Pictures to the sample tests: The pieces that were eaten in the same\naction are painted the same color. The pieces lying on the anti-diagonal\ncontain the numbers of the action as a result of which these pieces were\neaten. In the second sample test the Andrewid tries to start eating chocolate\nfor the second time during his fifth action, starting from the cell at the\nintersection of the 10-th column and the 1-st row, but this cell is already\nempty, so he does not eat anything.\n\n",
