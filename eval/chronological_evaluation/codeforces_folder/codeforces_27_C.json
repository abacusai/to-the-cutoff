        "description": "The sequence is called ordered if it is non-decreasing or non-increasing. For\nexample, sequnces [3, 1, 1, 0] and [1, 2, 3, 100] are ordered, but the\nsequence [1, 3, 3, 1] is not. You are given a sequence of numbers. You are to\nfind it's shortest subsequence which is not ordered. A subsequence is a\nsequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more\nelements without changing the order of the remaining elements. Input The first\nline of the input contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5). The second line\ncontains n space-separated integers \u2014 the given sequence. All numbers in this\nsequence do not exceed 10^6 by absolute value. Output If the given sequence\ndoes not contain any unordered subsequences, output 0. Otherwise, output the\nlength k of the shortest such subsequence. Then output k integers from the\nrange [1..n] \u2014 indexes of the elements of this subsequence. If there are\nseveral solutions, output any of them. Examples Input 5 67 499 600 42 23\nOutput 3 1 3 5 Input 3 1 2 3 Output 0 Input 3 2 3 1 Output 3 1 2 3\n\n",
