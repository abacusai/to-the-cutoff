        "description": "Ivan Anatolyevich's agency is starting to become famous in the town. They have\nalready ordered and made n TV commercial videos. Each video is made in a\nspecial way: the colors and the soundtrack are adjusted to the time of the day\nand the viewers' mood. That's why the i-th video can only be shown within the\ntime range of [li, ri] (it is not necessary to use the whole segment but the\nbroadcast time should be within this segment). Now it's time to choose a TV\nchannel to broadcast the commercial. Overall, there are m TV channels\nbroadcasting in the city, the j-th one has cj viewers, and is ready to sell\ntime [aj, bj] to broadcast the commercial. Ivan Anatolyevich is facing a hard\nchoice: he has to choose exactly one video i and exactly one TV channel j to\nbroadcast this video and also a time range to broadcast [x, y]. At that the\ntime range should be chosen so that it is both within range [li, ri] and\nwithin range [aj, bj]. Let's define the efficiency of the broadcast as value\n(y - x)\u00b7cj \u2014 the total sum of time that all the viewers of the TV channel are\ngoing to spend watching the commercial. Help Ivan Anatolyevich choose the\nbroadcast with the maximum efficiency! Input The first line contains two\nintegers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of commercial videos and\nchannels, respectively. Each of the following n lines contains two integers\nli, ri (0 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the segment of time when it is possible to show\nthe corresponding video. Each of the following m lines contains three integers\naj, bj, cj (0 \u2264 aj \u2264 bj \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 cj \u2264 10^9), characterizing the TV channel.\nOutput In the first line print an integer \u2014 the maximum possible efficiency of\nthe broadcast. If there is no correct way to get a strictly positive\nefficiency, print a zero. If the maximum efficiency is strictly positive, in\nthe second line also print the number of the video i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) and the\nnumber of the TV channel j (1 \u2264 j \u2264 m) in the most effective broadcast. If\nthere are multiple optimal answers, you can print any of them. Examples Input\n2 3 7 9 1 4 2 8 2 0 4 1 8 9 3 Output 4 2 1 Input 1 1 0 0 1 1 10 Output 0 Note\nIn the first sample test the most optimal solution is to show the second\ncommercial using the first TV channel at time [2, 4]. The efficiency of such\nsolution is equal to (4 - 2)\u00b72 = 4. In the second sample test Ivan\nAnatolievich's wish does not meet the options of the TV channel, the segments\ndo not intersect, so the answer is zero.\n\n",
