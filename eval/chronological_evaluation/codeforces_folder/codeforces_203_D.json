        "description": "When Valera was playing football on a stadium, it suddenly began to rain.\nValera hid in the corridor under the grandstand not to get wet. However, the\ndesire to play was so great that he decided to train his hitting the ball\nright in this corridor. Valera went back far enough, put the ball and hit it.\nThe ball bounced off the walls, the ceiling and the floor corridor and finally\nhit the exit door. As the ball was wet, it left a spot on the door. Now Valera\nwants to know the coordinates for this spot. Let's describe the event more\nformally. The ball will be considered a point in space. The door of the\ncorridor will be considered a rectangle located on plane xOz, such that the\nlower left corner of the door is located at point (0, 0, 0), and the upper\nright corner is located at point (a, 0, b) . The corridor will be considered\nas a rectangular parallelepiped, infinite in the direction of increasing\ncoordinates of y. In this corridor the floor will be considered as plane xOy,\nand the ceiling as plane, parallel to xOy and passing through point (a, 0, b).\nWe will also assume that one of the walls is plane yOz, and the other wall is\nplane, parallel to yOz and passing through point (a, 0, b). We'll say that the\nball hit the door when its coordinate y was equal to 0. Thus the coordinates\nof the spot are point (x0, 0, z0), where 0 \u2264 x0 \u2264 a, 0 \u2264 z0 \u2264 b. To hit the\nball, Valera steps away from the door at distance m and puts the ball in the\ncenter of the corridor at point . After the hit the ball flies at speed (vx,\nvy, vz). This means that if the ball has coordinates (x, y, z), then after one\nsecond it will have coordinates (x + vx, y + vy, z + vz). See image in notes\nfor clarification. When the ball collides with the ceiling, the floor or a\nwall of the corridor, it bounces off in accordance with the laws of reflection\n(the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection). In the problem we\nconsider the ideal physical model, so we can assume that there is no air\nresistance, friction force, or any loss of energy. Input The first line\ncontains three space-separated integers a, b, m (1 \u2264 a, b, m \u2264 100). The first\ntwo integers specify point (a, 0, b), through which the ceiling and one of the\ncorridor walls pass. The third integer is the distance at which Valera went\naway from the door. The second line has three space-separated integers vx, vy,\nvz (|vx|, |vy|, |vz| \u2264 100, vy < 0, vz \u2265 0) \u2014 the speed of the ball after the\nhit. It is guaranteed that the ball hits the door. Output Print two real\nnumbers x0, z0 \u2014 the x and z coordinates of point (x0, 0, z0), at which the\nball hits the exit door. The answer will be considered correct, if its\nabsolute or relative error does not exceed 10 ^-6.
