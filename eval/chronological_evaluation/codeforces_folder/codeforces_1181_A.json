        "description": "Soon after the Chunga-Changa island was discovered, it started to acquire some\nforms of civilization and even market economy. A new currency arose,\ncolloquially called \"chizhik\". One has to pay in chizhiks to buy a coconut\nnow. Sasha and Masha are about to buy some coconuts which are sold at price\n\n    z\n chizhiks per coconut. Sasha has \n    x\n chizhiks, Masha has \n    y\n\nchizhiks. Each girl will buy as many coconuts as she can using only her money.\nThis way each girl will buy an integer non-negative number of coconuts. The\ngirls discussed their plans and found that the total number of coconuts they\nbuy can increase (or decrease) if one of them gives several chizhiks to the\nother girl. The chizhiks can't be split in parts, so the girls can only\nexchange with integer number of chizhiks. Consider the following example.\nSuppose Sasha has \n    5\n chizhiks, Masha has \n    4\n chizhiks, and the price\nfor one coconut be \n    3\n chizhiks. If the girls don't exchange with\nchizhiks, they will buy \n    1 + 1 = 2\n coconuts. However, if, for example,\nMasha gives Sasha one chizhik, then Sasha will have \n    6\n chizhiks, Masha\nwill have \n    3\n chizhiks, and the girls will buy \n    2 + 1 = 3\n coconuts.\nIt is not that easy to live on the island now, so Sasha and Mash want to\nexchange with chizhiks in such a way that they will buy the maximum possible\nnumber of coconuts. Nobody wants to have a debt, so among all possible ways to\nbuy the maximum possible number of coconuts find such a way that minimizes the\nnumber of chizhiks one girl gives to the other (it is not important who will\nbe the person giving the chizhiks). Input The first line contains three\nintegers \n    x\n, \n    y\n and \n    z\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 10^18\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 z \n    \u2264 10^18\n) \u2014 the number of chizhics Sasha has, the number of\nchizhics Masha has and the price of a coconut. Output Print two integers: the\nmaximum possible number of coconuts the girls can buy and the minimum number\nof chizhiks one girl has to give to the other. Examples Input 5 4 3 Output 3 1\nInput 6 8 2 Output 7 0 Note The first example is described in the statement.\nIn the second example the optimal solution is to dot exchange any chizhiks.\nThe girls will buy \n    3 + 4 = 7\n coconuts.\n\n",
