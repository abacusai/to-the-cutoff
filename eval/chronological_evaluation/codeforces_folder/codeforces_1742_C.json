        "description": "On an \n    8 \n    \u00d7 8\n grid, some horizontal rows have been painted red, and\nsome vertical columns have been painted blue, in some order. The stripes are\ndrawn sequentially, one after the other. When the stripe is drawn, it repaints\nall the cells through which it passes. Determine which color was used last.\nThe red stripe was painted after the blue one, so the answer is R. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 4000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases\nfollows. There is an empty line before each test case. Each test case consists\nof \n    8\n lines, each containing \n    8\n characters. Each of these characters\nis either 'R', 'B', or '.', denoting a red square, a blue square, and an\nunpainted square, respectively. It is guaranteed that the given field is\nobtained from a colorless one by drawing horizontal red rows and vertical blue\ncolumns. At least one stripe is painted. Output For each test case, output 'R'\nif a red stripe was painted last, and 'B' if a blue stripe was painted last\n(without quotes). Example Input 4 ....B... ....B... ....B...

In the second test case, the first blue column is painted\nfirst, then the first and last red rows, and finally the last blue column.\nSince a blue stripe is painted last, the answer is B.\n\n",
