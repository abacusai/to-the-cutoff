        "description": "You are given an undirected graph, constisting of n vertices and m edges. Each\nedge of the graph has some non-negative integer written on it. Let's call a\ntriple (u, v, s) interesting, if 1 \u2264 u < v \u2264 n and there is a path (possibly\nnon-simple, i.e. it can visit the same vertices and edges multiple times)\nbetween vertices u and v such that xor of all numbers written on the edges of\nthis path is equal to s. When we compute the value s for some path, each edge\nis counted in xor as many times, as it appear on this path. It's not hard to\nprove that there are finite number of such triples. Calculate the sum over\nmodulo 10^9 + 7 of the values of s over all interesting triples. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 0 \u2264 m\n\u2264 200 000) \u2014 numbers of vertices and edges in the given graph. The follow m\nlines contain three integers ui, vi and ti (1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 ti \u2264 10^18, ui\n\u2260 vi) \u2014 vertices connected by the edge and integer written on it. It is\nguaranteed that graph doesn't contain self-loops and multiple edges. Output\nPrint the single integer, equal to the described sum over modulo 10^9 + 7.\nExamples Input 4 4 1 2 1 1 3 2 2 3 3 3 4 1 Output 12 Input 4 4 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 4\n4 4 1 8 Output 90 Input 8 6 1 2 2 2 3 1 2 4 4 4 5 5 4 6 3 7 8 5 Output 62 Note\nIn the first example the are 6 interesting triples: (1, 2, 1) (1, 3, 2) (1, 4,\n3) (2, 3, 3) (2, 4, 2) (3, 4, 1) The sum is equal to 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 =\n12.In the second example the are 12 interesting triples: (1, 2, 1) (2, 3, 2)\n(1, 3, 3) (3, 4, 4) (2, 4, 6) (1, 4, 7) (1, 4, 8) (2, 4, 9) (3, 4, 11) (1, 3,\n12) (2, 3, 13) (1, 2, 14) The sum is equal to 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 +\n11 + 12 + 13 + 14 = 90.\n\n",
