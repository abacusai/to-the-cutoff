        "description": "Ridhiman challenged Ashish to find the maximum valued subsequence of an array\n\n    a\n of size \n    n\n consisting of positive integers. The value of a non-\nempty subsequence of \n    k\n elements of \n    a\n is defined as \n    \u2211\n    2^i\n over all integers \n    i \n    \u2265 0\n such that at least \n    max(1, k -\n    2)\n elements of the subsequence have the \n    i\n-th bit set in their binary\nrepresentation (value \n    x\n has the \n    i\n-th bit set in its binary\nrepresentation if \n    \u230a\n    x/2^i\n    \u230b\n     2\n is equal\nto \n    1\n). Recall that \n    b\n is a subsequence of \n    a\n, if \n    b\n can\nbe obtained by deleting some(possibly zero) elements from \n    a\n. Help Ashish\nfind the maximum value he can get by choosing some subsequence of \n    a\n.\nInput The first line of the input consists of a single integer \n    n\n \n    (1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 500)\n \u2014 the size of \n    a\n. The next line consists of \n    n\n\nspace-separated integers \u2014 the elements of the array \n    (1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    10^18)\n. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the maximum value Ashish can get\nby choosing some subsequence of \n    a\n. Examples Input 3 2 1 3 Output 3 Input\n3 3 1 4 Output 7 Input 1 1 Output 1 Input 4 7 7 1 1 Output 7 Note For the\nfirst test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence \n    2, 3\n of\nsize \n    2\n. The binary representation of \n    2\n is 10 and that of \n    3\n\nis 11. Since \n    max(k - 2, 1)\n is equal to \n    1\n, the value of the\nsubsequence is \n    2^0 + 2^1\n (both \n    2\n and \n    3\n have \n    1\n-st bit\nset in their binary representation and \n    3\n has \n    0\n-th bit set in its\nbinary representation). Note that he could also pick the subsequence\n\n    3\n or \n    2, 1, 3\n. For the second test case,\nAshish can pick the subsequence \n    3, 4\n with value \n    7\n. For\nthe third test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence \n    1\n with\nvalue \n    1\n. For the fourth test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence\n\n    7, 7\n with value \n    7\n.\n\n",
