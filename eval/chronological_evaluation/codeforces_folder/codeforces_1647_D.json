        "description": "Madoka is going to enroll in \"TSUNS PTU\". But she stumbled upon a difficult\ntask during the entrance computer science exam: A number is called good if it\nis a multiple of \n    d\n. A number is called beatiful if it is good and it\ncannot be represented as a product of two good numbers. Notice that a\nbeautiful number must be good. Given a good number \n    x\n, determine whether\nit can be represented in at least two different ways as a product of several\n(possibly, one) beautiful numbers. Two ways are different if the sets of\nnumbers used are different. Solve this problem for Madoka and help her to\nenroll in the best school in Russia! Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 number of test cases. Below\ncomes their description. Each test case consists of two integers \n    x\n and\n\n    d\n, separated by a space (\n    2 \n    \u2264 x, d \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is\nguaranteed that \n    x\n is a multiple of \n    d\n. Output For each set of input\ndata, output \"NO\" if the number cannot be represented in at least two ways.\nOtherwise, output \"YES\". You can output each letter in any case (for example,\n\"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\", \"yEs\" will be recognized as a positive answer).\nExample Input 8 6 2 12 2 36 2 8 2 1000 10 2376 6 128 4 16384 4 Output NO NO\nYES NO YES YES NO YES Note In the first example, \n    6\n can be represented as\n\n    6\n, \n    1 \n    \u00b7 6\n, \n    2 \n    \u00b7 3\n. But \n    3\n and \n    1\n are not\na good numbers because they are not divisible by \n    2\n, so there is only one\nway. In the second example, \n    12\n can be represented as \n    6 \n    \u00b7 2\n,\n\n    12\n, \n    3 \n    \u00b7 4\n, or \n    3 \n    \u00b7 2 \n    \u00b7 2\n. The first option\nis suitable. The second is\u2014 no, because \n    12\n is not beautiful number\n(\n    12 = 6 \n    \u00b7 2\n). The third and fourth are also not suitable, because\n\n    3\n is not good number. In the third example, \n    36\n can be represented\nas \n    18 \n    \u00b7 2\n and \n    6 \n    \u00b7 6\n. Therefore it can be decomposed in\nat least two ways.\n\n",
