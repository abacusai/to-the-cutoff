        "description": "After long-term research and lots of experiments leading Megapolian automobile\nmanufacturer \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb released a brand new car model named \u00abLada Malina\u00bb. One\nof the most impressive features of \u00abLada Malina\u00bb is its highly efficient\nenvironment-friendly engines. Consider car as a point in Oxy plane. Car is\nequipped with k engines numbered from 1 to k. Each engine is defined by its\nvelocity vector whose coordinates are (vxi, vyi) measured in distance units\nper day. An engine may be turned on at any level wi, that is a real number\nbetween - 1 and + 1 (inclusive) that result in a term of (wi\u00b7vxi, wi\u00b7vyi) in\nthe final car velocity. Namely, the final car velocity is equal to (w1\u00b7vx1 +\nw2\u00b7vx2 + ... + wk\u00b7vxk, w1\u00b7vy1 + w2\u00b7vy2 + ... + wk\u00b7vyk) Formally, if car moves\nwith constant values of wi during the whole day then its x-coordinate will\nchange by the first component of an expression above, and its y-coordinate\nwill change by the second component of an expression above. For example, if\nall wi are equal to zero, the car won't move, and if all wi are equal to zero\nexcept w1 = 1, then car will move with the velocity of the first engine. There\nare n factories in Megapolia, i-th of them is located in (fxi, fyi). On the\ni-th factory there are ai cars \u00abLada Malina\u00bb that are ready for operation. As\nan attempt to increase sales of a new car, \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb is going to hold an\ninternational exposition of cars. There are q options of exposition location\nand time, in the i-th of them exposition will happen in a point with\ncoordinates (pxi, pyi) in ti days. Of course, at the \u00abAutoVoz\u00bb is going to\nbring as much new cars from factories as possible to the place of exposition.\nCars are going to be moved by enabling their engines on some certain levels,\nsuch that at the beginning of an exposition car gets exactly to the exposition\nlocation. However, for some of the options it may be impossible to bring cars\nfrom some of the factories to the exposition location by the moment of an\nexposition. Your task is to determine for each of the options of exposition\nlocation and time how many cars will be able to get there by the beginning of\nan exposition. Input The first line of input contains three integers k, n, q\n(2 \u2264 k \u2264 10, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5), the number of engines of \u00abLada\nMalina\u00bb, number of factories producing \u00abLada Malina\u00bb and number of options of\nan exposition time and location respectively. The following k lines contain\nthe descriptions of \u00abLada Malina\u00bb engines. The i-th of them contains two\nintegers vxi, vyi ( - 1000 \u2264 vxi, vyi \u2264 1000) defining the velocity vector of\nthe i-th engine. Velocity vector can't be zero, i.e. at least one of vxi and\nvyi is not equal to zero. It is guaranteed that no two velosity vectors are\ncollinear (parallel). Next n lines contain the descriptions of factories. The\ni-th of them contains two integers fxi, fyi, ai ( - 10^9 \u2264 fxi, fyi \u2264 10^9, 1\n\u2264 ai \u2264 10^9) defining the coordinates of the i-th factory location and the\nnumber of cars that are located there. The following q lines contain the\ndescriptions of the car exposition. The i-th of them contains three integers\npxi, pyi, ti ( - 10^9 \u2264 pxi, pyi \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 ti \u2264 10^5) defining the\ncoordinates of the exposition location and the number of days till the\nexposition start in the i-th option. Output For each possible option of the\nexposition output the number of cars that will be able to get to the\nexposition location by the moment of its beginning. Examples Input 2 4 1 1 1\n-1 1 2 3 1 2 -2 1 -2 1 1 -2 -2 1 0 0 2 Output 3 Input 3 4 3 2 0 -1 1 -1 -2 -3\n0 6 1 -2 1 -3 -7 3 3 2 2 -1 -4 1 0 4 2 6 0 1 Output 4 9 0 Note Images\ndescribing sample tests are given below. Exposition options are denoted with\ncrosses, factories are denoted with points. Each factory is labeled with a\nnumber of cars that it has. First sample test explanation: Car from the first\nfactory is not able to get to the exposition location in time. Car from the\nsecond factory can get to the exposition in time if we set w1 = 0, w2 = 1. Car\nfrom the third factory can get to the exposition in time if we set , . Car\nfrom the fourth factory can get to the exposition in time if we set w1 = 1, w2\n= 0.\n\n",
