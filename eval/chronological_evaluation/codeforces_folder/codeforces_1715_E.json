        "description": "Stanley lives in a country that consists of \n    n\n cities (he lives in city\n\n    1\n). There are bidirectional roads between some of the cities, and you\nknow how long it takes to ride through each of them. Additionally, there is a\nflight between each pair of cities, the flight between cities \n    u\n and\n\n    v\n takes \n    (u - v)^2\n time. Stanley is quite afraid of flying because\nof watching \"Sully: Miracle on the Hudson\" recently, so he can take at most\n\n    k\n flights. Stanley wants to know the minimum time of a journey to each\nof the \n    n\n cities from the city \n    1\n. Input In the first line of input\nthere are three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, and \n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 20\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of cities, the number of roads, and the maximal number of flights\nStanley can take. The following \n    m\n lines describe the roads. Each\ncontains three integers \n    u\n, \n    v\n, \n    w\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u, v \n    \u2264\n    n\n, \n    u \n    \u2260 v\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 w \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the cities the road\nconnects and the time it takes to ride through. Note that some pairs of cities\nmay be connected by more than one road. Output Print \n    n\n integers,\n\n    i\n-th of which is equal to the minimum time of traveling to city \n    i\n.\nExamples Input 3 1 2 1 3 1 Output 0 1 1 Input 4 3 1 1 2 3 2 4 5 3 4 7 Output 0\n1 4 6 Input 2 1 1 2 1 893746473 Output 0 1 Input 5 5 2 2 1 33 1 5 93 5 3 48 2\n3 21 4 2 1 Output 0 1 2 2 3 Note In the first sample, it takes no time to get\nto city 1; to get to city 2 it is possible to use a flight between 1 and 2,\nwhich will take 1 unit of time; to city 3 you can get via a road from city 1,\nwhich will take 1 unit of time. In the second sample, it also takes no time to\nget to city 1. To get to city 2 Stanley should use a flight between 1 and 2,\nwhich will take 1 unit of time. To get to city 3 Stanley can ride between\ncities 1 and 2, which will take 3 units of time, and then use a flight between\n2 and 3. To get to city 4 Stanley should use a flight between 1 and 2, then\ntake a ride from 2 to 4, which will take 5 units of time.\n\n",
