        "description": "n people are standing on a coordinate axis in points with positive integer\ncoordinates strictly less than 10^6. For each person we know in which\ndirection (left or right) he is facing, and his maximum speed. You can put a\nbomb in some point with non-negative integer coordinate, and blow it up. At\nthis moment all people will start running with their maximum speed in the\ndirection they are facing. Also, two strange rays will start propagating from\nthe bomb with speed s: one to the right, and one to the left. Of course, the\nspeed s is strictly greater than people's maximum speed. The rays are strange\nbecause if at any moment the position and the direction of movement of some\nray and some person coincide, then the speed of the person immediately\nincreases by the speed of the ray. You need to place the bomb is such a point\nthat the minimum time moment in which there is a person that has run through\npoint 0, and there is a person that has run through point 10^6, is as small as\npossible. In other words, find the minimum time moment t such that there is a\npoint you can place the bomb to so that at time moment t some person has run\nthrough 0, and some person has run through point 10^6. Input The first line\ncontains two integers n and s (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 2 \u2264 s \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of\npeople and the rays' speed. The next n lines contain the description of\npeople. The i-th of these lines contains three integers xi, vi and ti (0 < xi\n< 10^6, 1 \u2264 vi < s, 1 \u2264 ti \u2264 2) \u2014 the coordinate of the i-th person on the\nline, his maximum speed and the direction he will run to (1 is to the left,\ni.e. in the direction of coordinate decrease, 2 is to the right, i.e. in the\ndirection of coordinate increase), respectively. It is guaranteed that the\npoints 0 and 10^6 will be reached independently of the bomb's position. Output\nPrint the minimum time needed for both points 0 and 10^6 to be reached. Your\nanswer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed\n10^-6. Namely, if your answer is a, and the jury's answer is b, then your\nanswer is accepted, if . Examples Input 2 999 400000 1 2 500000 1 1 Output\n500000.000000000000000000000000000000 Input 2 1000 400000 500 1 600000 500 2\nOutput 400.000000000000000000000000000000 Note In the first example, it is\noptimal to place the bomb at a point with a coordinate of 400000. Then at time\n0, the speed of the first person becomes 1000 and he reaches the point 10^6 at\nthe time 600. The bomb will not affect on the second person, and he will reach\nthe 0 point at the time 500000. In the second example, it is optimal to place\nthe bomb at the point 500000. The rays will catch up with both people at the\ntime 200. At this time moment, the first is at the point with a coordinate of\n300000, and the second is at the point with a coordinate of 700000. Their\nspeed will become 1500 and at the time 400 they will simultaneously run\nthrough points 0 and 10^6.\n\n",
