        "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game on strings. Initially, they have some string\n\n    t\n. In one move the first player selects the character \n    c\n present in\n\n    t\n and erases all it's occurrences in \n    t\n, thus splitting \n    t\n\ninto many smaller strings. The game then goes independently with each of the\nstrings \u2014 to make the move player selects one of the strings and one of the\ncharacters there, deletes all occurrences and adds the remaining string back\nto the game. Alice always starts the game, and then Alice and Bob take turns\nmaking moves. The player who is unable to make a move (because there is no\nstring left) loses. Alice and Bob used to always start with a string \n    s\n,\nbut recently they found out that this became too boring. Now before each game\nthey choose two integers \n    l\n and \n    r\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r\n    \n    \u2264 |s|\n and play the game with the string \n    s_l s_l+1 s_l+2\n    \u2026 s_r\n instead. Given the string \n    s\n and integers \n    l\n,\n\n    r\n for each game. Find who is going to win each game assuming they are\nsmart and are playing optimally. Input The first line contains the string\n\n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 |s| \n    \u2264 10^5\n) consisting of lowercase English\nletters. This is the string Alice and Bob used to start with. The second line\ncontains a single integer \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\ngames to analyze. Each of the next \n    m\n lines contains two integers \n    l\n\nand \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 |s|\n) \u2014 the bounds of the starting\nsubstring in the string \n    s\n. Output For each game output a single line\ncontaining the name of the winner \u2014 \"Alice\" or \"Bob\" respectively. Examples\nInput aaab 2 1 2 1 4 Output Alice Bob Input aaccbdb 2 5 7 1 7 Output Alice\nAlice Note In the first example, In the first game the string \"aa\" is\nselected. Alice deletes character 'a' and Bob is unable to move. In the second\ngame the string \"aaab\" is selected. No matter what character Alice will\ndelete, Bob deletes the other one and Alice is unable to move. In the second\nexample Alice wins both game \"bdb\" and \"aaccbdb\". To win game \"bdb\" Alice can\nerase symbol 'd', the game then goes independently on strings \"b\" and \"b\". Bob\ndeletes one of this strings and the Alice deletes the other one and Bob is\nunable to move. To win game \"aaccbdb\" Alice can erase symbol 'd', the game\nthen goes independently on strings \"aaccb\" and \"b\". It is possible to show,\nthat no matter what are the moves, the remaining game can only finish in\nexactly \n    4\n moves, so the Bob will be unable to move after that.\n\n",
