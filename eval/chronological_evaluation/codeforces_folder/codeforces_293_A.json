        "description": "Yaroslav, Andrey and Roman can play cubes for hours and hours. But the game is\nfor three, so when Roman doesn't show up, Yaroslav and Andrey play another\ngame. Roman leaves a word for each of them. Each word consists of 2\u00b7n binary\ncharacters \"0\" or \"1\". After that the players start moving in turns. Yaroslav\nmoves first. During a move, a player must choose an integer from 1 to 2\u00b7n,\nwhich hasn't been chosen by anybody up to that moment. Then the player takes a\npiece of paper and writes out the corresponding character from his string.\nLet's represent Yaroslav's word as s = s1s2... s2n. Similarly, let's represent\nAndrey's word as t = t1t2... t2n. Then, if Yaroslav choose number k during his\nmove, then he is going to write out character sk on the piece of paper.\nSimilarly, if Andrey choose number r during his move, then he is going to\nwrite out character tr on the piece of paper. The game finishes when no player\ncan make a move. After the game is over, Yaroslav makes some integer from the\ncharacters written on his piece of paper (Yaroslav can arrange these\ncharacters as he wants). Andrey does the same. The resulting numbers can\ncontain leading zeroes. The person with the largest number wins. If the\nnumbers are equal, the game ends with a draw. You are given two strings s and\nt. Determine the outcome of the game provided that Yaroslav and Andrey play\noptimally well. Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6). The\nsecond line contains string s \u2014 Yaroslav's word. The third line contains\nstring t \u2014 Andrey's word. It is guaranteed that both words consist of 2\u00b7n\ncharacters \"0\" and \"1\". Output Print \"First\", if both players play optimally\nwell and Yaroslav wins. If Andrey wins, print \"Second\" and if the game ends\nwith a draw, print \"Draw\". Print the words without the quotes. Examples Input\n2 0111 0001 Output First Input 3 110110 001001 Output First Input 3 111000\n000111 Output Draw Input 4 01010110 00101101 Output First Input 4 01100000\n10010011 Output Second\n\n",
