        "description": "Mike has a sequence A = [a1, a2, ..., an] of length n. He considers the\nsequence B = [b1, b2, ..., bn] beautiful if the gcd of all its elements is\nbigger than 1, i.e. . Mike wants to change his sequence in order to make it\nbeautiful. In one move he can choose an index i (1 \u2264 i < n), delete numbers\nai, ai + 1 and put numbers ai - ai + 1, ai + ai + 1 in their place instead, in\nthis order. He wants perform as few operations as possible. Find the minimal\nnumber of operations to make sequence A beautiful if it's possible, or tell\nhim that it is impossible to do so. is the biggest non-negative number d such\nthat d divides bi for every i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n). Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u2014 length of sequence A. The second line\ncontains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9) \u2014 elements\nof sequence A. Output Output on the first line \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is\npossible to make sequence A beautiful by performing operations described\nabove, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. If the answer was \"YES\", output\nthe minimal number of moves needed to make sequence A beautiful. Examples\nInput 2 1 1 Output YES 1 Input 3 6 2 4 Output YES 0 Input 2 1 3 Output YES 1\nNote In the first example you can simply make one move to obtain sequence [0,\n2] with . In the second example the gcd of the sequence is already greater\nthan 1.\n\n",
