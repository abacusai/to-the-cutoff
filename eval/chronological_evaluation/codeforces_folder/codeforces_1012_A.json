        "name": "Photo of The Sky",
        "description": "Pavel made a photo of his favourite stars in the sky. His camera takes a photo\nof all points of the sky that belong to some rectangle with sides parallel to\nthe coordinate axes. Strictly speaking, it makes a photo of all points with\ncoordinates \n    (x, y)\n, such that \n    x_1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 x_2\n and \n    y_1\n    \n    \u2264 y \n    \u2264 y_2\n, where \n    (x_1, y_1)\n and \n    (x_2, y_2)\n are\ncoordinates of the left bottom and the right top corners of the rectangle\nbeing photographed. The area of this rectangle can be zero. After taking the\nphoto, Pavel wrote down coordinates of \n    n\n of his favourite stars which\nappeared in the photo. These points are not necessarily distinct, there can be\nmultiple stars in the same point of the sky. Pavel has lost his camera\nrecently and wants to buy a similar one. Specifically, he wants to know the\ndimensions of the photo he took earlier. Unfortunately, the photo is also\nlost. His notes are also of not much help; numbers are written in random order\nall over his notepad, so it's impossible to tell which numbers specify\ncoordinates of which points. Pavel asked you to help him to determine what are\nthe possible dimensions of the photo according to his notes. As there are\nmultiple possible answers, find the dimensions with the minimal possible area\nof the rectangle. Input The first line of the input contains an only integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n), the number of points in Pavel's\nrecords. The second line contains \n    2 \n    \u00b7 n\n integers \n    a_1\n,\n\n    a_2\n, ..., \n    a_2 \n    \u00b7 n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n),\ncoordinates, written by Pavel in some order. Output Print the only integer,\nthe minimal area of the rectangle which could have contained all points from\nPavel's records. Examples Input 4 4 1 3 2 3 2 1 3 Output 1 Input 3 5 8 5 5 7 5\nOutput 0 Note In the first sample stars in Pavel's records can be \n    (1,\n    3)\n, \n    (1, 3)\n, \n    (2, 3)\n, \n    (2, 4)\n. In this case, the minimal\narea of the rectangle, which contains all these points is \n    1\n (rectangle\nwith corners at \n    (1, 3)\n and \n    (2, 4)\n).\n\n",
