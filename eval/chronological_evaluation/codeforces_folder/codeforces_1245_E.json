        "description": "Hyakugoku has just retired from being the resident deity of the South Black\nSnail Temple in order to pursue her dream of becoming a cartoonist. She spent\nsix months in that temple just playing \"Cat's Cradle\" so now she wants to try\na different game \u2014 \"Snakes and Ladders\". Unfortunately, she already killed all\nthe snakes, so there are only ladders left now. The game is played on a \n    10\n    \n    \u00d7 10\n board as follows: At the beginning of the game, the player is\nat the bottom left square. The objective of the game is for the player to\nreach the Goal (the top left square) by following the path and climbing\nvertical ladders. Once the player reaches the Goal, the game ends. The path is\nas follows: if a square is not the end of its row, it leads to the square next\nto it along the direction of its row; if a square is the end of its row, it\nleads to the square above it. The direction of a row is determined as follows:\nthe direction of the bottom row is to the right; the direction of any other\nrow is opposite the direction of the row below it. See Notes section for\nvisualization of path. During each turn, the player rolls a standard six-sided\ndice. Suppose that the number shown on the dice is \n    r\n. If the Goal is\nless than \n    r\n squares away on the path, the player doesn't move (but the\nturn is performed). Otherwise, the player advances exactly \n    r\n squares\nalong the path and then stops. If the player stops on a square with the bottom\nof a ladder, the player chooses whether or not to climb up that ladder. If she\nchooses not to climb, then she stays in that square for the beginning of the\nnext turn. Some squares have a ladder in them. Ladders are only placed\nvertically \u2014 each one leads to the same square of some of the upper rows. In\norder for the player to climb up a ladder, after rolling the dice, she must\nstop at the square containing the bottom of the ladder. After using the\nladder, the player will end up in the square containing the top of the ladder.\nShe cannot leave the ladder in the middle of climbing. And if the square\ncontaining the top of the ladder also contains the bottom of another ladder,\nshe is not allowed to use that second ladder. The numbers on the faces of the\ndice are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with each number having the same probability of\nbeing shown. Please note that: it is possible for ladders to overlap, but the\nplayer cannot switch to the other ladder while in the middle of climbing the\nfirst one; it is possible for ladders to go straight to the top row, but not\nany higher; it is possible for two ladders to lead to the same tile; it is\npossible for a ladder to lead to a tile that also has a ladder, but the player\nwill not be able to use that second ladder if she uses the first one; the\nplayer can only climb up ladders, not climb down. Hyakugoku wants to finish\nthe game as soon as possible. Thus, on each turn she chooses whether to climb\nthe ladder or not optimally. Help her to determine the minimum expected number\nof turns the game will take. Input Input will consist of ten lines. The\n\n    i\n-th line will contain 10 non-negative integers \n    h_i1, h_i2,\n    \n    \u2026, h_i10\n. If \n    h_ij\n is \n    0\n, then the tile at the\n\n    i\n-th row and \n    j\n-th column has no ladder. Otherwise, the ladder at\nthat tile will have a height of \n    h_ij\n, i.e. climbing it will lead to\nthe tile \n    h_ij\n rows directly above. It is guaranteed that \n    0 \n    \u2264\n    h_ij < i\n. Also, the first number of the first line and the first number\nof the last line always contain \n    0\n, i.e. the Goal and the starting tile\nnever have ladders. Output Print only one line containing a single floating-\npoint number \u2014 the minimum expected number of turns Hyakugoku can take to\nfinish the game. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or\nrelative error does not exceed \n    10^-6\n.

For the first example, there are no ladders.\nFor the second example, the board looks like the one in the right part of the\nimage (the ladders have been colored for clarity). It is possible for ladders\nto overlap, as is the case with the red and yellow ladders and green and blue\nladders. It is also possible for ladders to go straight to the top, as is the\ncase with the black and blue ladders. However, it is not possible for ladders\nto go any higher (outside of the board). It is also possible that two ladders\nlead to the same tile, as is the case with the red and yellow ladders. Also,\nnotice that the red and yellow ladders lead to the tile with the orange\nladder. So if the player chooses to climb either of the red and yellow\nladders, they will not be able to climb the orange ladder. Finally, notice\nthat the green ladder passes through the starting tile of the blue ladder. The\nplayer cannot transfer from the green ladder to the blue ladder while in the\nmiddle of climbing the green ladder.\n\n",
