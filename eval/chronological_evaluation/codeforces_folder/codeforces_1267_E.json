        "description": "Byteburg Senate elections are coming. Usually \"United Byteland\", the ruling\nByteland party, takes all the seats in the Senate to ensure stability and\nsustainable development. But this year there is one opposition candidate in\none of the constituencies. Even one opposition member can disturb the\nstability in the Senate, so the head of the Party asks you to ensure that the\nopposition candidate will not be elected. There are \n    n\n candidates,\nnumbered from 1 to \n    n\n. Candidate \n    n\n is the opposition candidate.\nThere are \n    m\n polling stations in the constituency, numbered from 1 to\n\n    m\n. You know the number of votes cast for each candidate at each polling\nstation. The only thing you can do to prevent the election of the opposition\ncandidate is to cancel the election results at some polling stations. The\nopposition candidate will be elected if the sum of the votes cast in their\nfavor at all non-canceled stations will be strictly greater than the analogous\nsum for every other candidate. Your task is to prevent the election of the\nopposition candidate by canceling the election results at the minimal possible\nnumber of polling stations. Notice that solution always exists, because if you\ncancel the elections at all polling stations, the number of votes for each\ncandidate will be 0, and the opposition candidate will not be elected. Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n\n(\n    2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 100\n; \n    1\n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of candidates\nand the number of polling stations. The next \n    m\n lines contain the\nelection results at each polling station with \n    n\n numbers on each line. In\nthe \n    i\n-th line the \n    j\n-th number is \n    a_i,j\n \u2014 the number of\nvotes cast for the candidate \n    j\n at the station \n    i\n (\n    0\n    \u2264 a_i,j\n    \u2264 1\n     000\n). Output In the first line output integer \n    k\n \u2014 the\nminimal number of the polling stations in which you need to cancel the\nelection results. In the second line output \n    k\n integers \u2014 the indices of\ncanceled polling stations, in any order. If there are multiple ways to cancel\nresults at \n    k\n stations, output any one of them. Examples Input 5 3 6 3 4\n2 8 3 7 5 6 7 5 2 4 7 9 Output 2 3 1 Input 2 1 1 1 Output 0 Input 3 3 2 3 8 4\n2 9 3 1 7 Output 3 1 2 3 Note In the first example, the candidates from 1 to 5\nreceived 14, 12, 13, 15, and 24 votes correspondingly. The opposition\ncandidate has the most votes. However, if you cancel the election results at\nthe first and the third polling stations, then only the result from the second\npolling station remains and the vote sums become 3, 7, 5, 6, and 7, without\nthe opposition candidate being in the lead anymore.\n\n",
