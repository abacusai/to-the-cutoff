        "description": "The sum of digits of a non-negative integer \n    a\n is the result of summing\nup its digits together when written in the decimal system. For example, the\nsum of digits of \n    123\n is \n    6\n and the sum of digits of \n    10\n is\n\n    1\n. In a formal way, the sum of digits of \n    a=\n    \u2211_i=0^\n    \u221e a_i \n    \u00b7 10^i\n, where \n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    9\n, is defined as \n    \u2211_i=0^\n    \u221ea_i\n. Given\nan integer \n    n\n, find two non-negative integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n which\nsatisfy the following conditions. \n    x+y=n\n, and the sum of digits of\n\n    x\n and the sum of digits of \n    y\n differ by at most \n    1\n. It can be\nshown that such \n    x\n and \n    y\n always exist. Input Each test contains\nmultiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n). Each test case consists of a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n) Output For each test case, print two\nintegers \n    x\n and \n    y\n. If there are multiple answers, print any.\nExample Input 5 1 161 67 1206 19 Output 1 0 67 94 60 7 1138 68 14 5 Note In\nthe second test case, the sum of digits of \n    67\n and the sum of digits of\n\n    94\n are both \n    13\n. In the third test case, the sum of digits of\n\n    60\n is \n    6\n, and the sum of digits of \n    7\n is \n    7\n.\n\n",
