        "name": "Time to Raid Cowavans",
        "description": "As you know, the most intelligent beings on the Earth are, of course, cows.\nThis conclusion was reached long ago by the Martian aliens, as well as a\nnumber of other intelligent civilizations from outer space. Sometimes cows\ngather into cowavans. This seems to be seasonal. But at this time the cows\nbecome passive and react poorly to external stimuli. A cowavan is a perfect\ntarget for the Martian scientific saucer, it's time for large-scale\nabductions, or, as the Martians say, raids. Simply put, a cowavan is a set of\ncows in a row. If we number all cows in the cowavan with positive integers\nfrom 1 to n, then we can formalize the popular model of abduction, known as\nthe (a, b)-Cowavan Raid: first they steal a cow number a, then number a + b,\nthen \u2014 number a + 2\u00b7b, and so on, until the number of an abducted cow exceeds\nn. During one raid the cows are not renumbered. The aliens would be happy to\nplace all the cows on board of their hospitable ship, but unfortunately, the\namount of cargo space is very, very limited. The researchers, knowing the mass\nof each cow in the cowavan, made p scenarios of the (a, b)-raid. Now they want\nto identify the following thing for each scenario individually: what total\nmass of pure beef will get on board of the ship. All the scenarios are\nindependent, in the process of performing the calculations the cows are not\nbeing stolen. Input The first line contains the only positive integer n (1 \u2264 n\n\u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of cows in the cowavan. The second number contains n\npositive integer wi, separated by spaces, where the i-th number describes the\nmass of the i-th cow in the cowavan (1 \u2264 wi \u2264 10^9). The third line contains\nthe only positive integer p \u2014 the number of scenarios of (a, b)-raids (1 \u2264 p \u2264\n3\u00b710^5). Each following line contains integer parameters a and b of the\ncorresponding scenario (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n). Output Print for each scenario of the\n(a, b)-raid the total mass of cows, that can be stolen using only this\nscenario. Please, do not use the \nintegers in \u0421++. It is recommended to use the cin, cout streams of the \nspecificator. Examples Input 3 1 2 3 2 1 1 1 2 Output 6 4 Input 4 2 3 5 7 3 1\n3 2 3 2 2 Output 9 3 10\n\n",
