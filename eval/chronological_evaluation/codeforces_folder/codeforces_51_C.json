        "description": "The New Vasjuki village is stretched along the motorway and that's why every\nhouse on it is characterized by its shift relative to some fixed point \u2014 the\nxi coordinate. The village consists of n houses, the i-th house is located in\nthe point with coordinates of xi. TELE3, a cellular communication provider\nplanned to locate three base stations so as to provide every house in the\nvillage with cellular communication. The base station having power d located\nin the point t provides with communication all the houses on the segment [t -\nd, t + d] (including boundaries). To simplify the integration (and simply not\nto mix anything up) all the three stations are planned to possess the equal\npower of d. Which minimal value of d is enough to provide all the houses in\nthe village with cellular communication. Input The first line contains an\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5) which represents the number of houses in the\nvillage. The second line contains the coordinates of houses \u2014 the sequence x1,\nx2, ..., xn of integer numbers (1 \u2264 xi \u2264 10^9). It is possible that two or\nmore houses are located on one point. The coordinates are given in a arbitrary\norder. Output Print the required minimal power d. In the second line print\nthree numbers \u2014 the possible coordinates of the base stations' location. Print\nthe coordinates with 6 digits after the decimal point. The positions of the\nstations can be any from 0 to 2\u00b710^9 inclusively. It is accepted for the base\nstations to have matching coordinates. If there are many solutions, print any\nof them. Examples Input 4 1 2 3 4 Output 0.500000 1.500000 2.500000 3.500000\nInput 3 10 20 30 Output 0 10.000000 20.000000 30.000000 Input 5 10003 10004\n10001 10002 1 Output 0.500000 1.000000 10001.500000 10003.500000\n\n",
