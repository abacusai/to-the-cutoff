        "description": "Allen wants to enter a fan zone that occupies a round square and has \n    n\n\nentrances. There already is a queue of \n    a_i\n people in front of the\n\n    i\n-th entrance. Each entrance allows one person from its queue to enter\nthe fan zone in one minute. Allen uses the following strategy to enter the fan\nzone: Initially he stands in the end of the queue in front of the first\nentrance. Each minute, if he is not allowed into the fan zone during the\nminute (meaning he is not the first in the queue), he leaves the current queue\nand stands in the end of the queue of the next entrance (or the first entrance\nif he leaves the last entrance). Determine the entrance through which Allen\nwill finally enter the fan zone. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of entrances. The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of people in queues. These numbers do\nnot include Allen. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of entrance that\nAllen will use. Examples Input 4 2 3 2 0 Output 3 Input 2 10 10 Output 1 Input\n6 5 2 6 5 7 4 Output 6 Note In the first example the number of people (not\nincluding Allen) changes as follows: \n    [\n    2, 3, 2, 0] \n    \u2192 [1,\n    \n    2, 1, 0] \n    \u2192 [0, 1, \n    0, 0]\n. The number in bold is\nthe queue Alles stands in. We see that he will enter the fan zone through the\nthird entrance. In the second example the number of people (not including\nAllen) changes as follows: \n    [\n    10, 10] \n    \u2192 [9, \n    9]\n    \n    \u2192 [\n    8, 8] \n    \u2192 [7, \n    7] \n    \u2192 [\n    6, 6] \n    \u2192\n    \n    \n     [5, \n    5] \n    \u2192 [\n    4, 4] \n    \u2192 [3, \n    3]\n    \n    \u2192 [\n    2, 2] \n    \u2192 [1, \n    1] \n    \u2192 [\n    0, 0]\n. In\nthe third example the number of people (not including Allen) changes as\nfollows: \n    [\n    5, 2, 6, 5, 7, 4] \n    \u2192 [4, \n    1, 5, 4, 6, 3]\n    \n    \u2192 [3, 0, \n    4, 3, 5, 2] \n    \u2192\n    \n    \n     [2, 0, 3, \n    2, 4,\n    1] \n    \u2192 [1, 0, 2, 1, \n    3, 0] \n    \u2192 [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, \n    0]\n.\n\n",
