        "description": "Information technologies are developing and are increasingly penetrating into\nall spheres of human activity. Incredible as it is, the most modern technology\nare used in farming! A large farm has a meadow with grazing sheep. Overall\nthere are n sheep and each of them contains a unique number from 1 to n \u2014\nbecause the sheep need to be distinguished and you need to remember\ninformation about each one, and they are so much alike! The meadow consists of\ninfinite number of regions numbered from 1 to infinity. It's known that sheep\ni likes regions from li to ri. There are two shepherds taking care of the\nsheep: First and Second. First wakes up early in the morning and leads the\nsheep graze on the lawn. Second comes in the evening and collects all the\nsheep. One morning, First woke up a little later than usual, and had no time\nto lead the sheep graze on the lawn. So he tied together every two sheep if\nthere is a region they both like. First thought that it would be better \u2014\nSecond would have less work in the evening, because sheep won't scatter too\nmuch, being tied to each other! In the evening Second came on the lawn,\ngathered the sheep and tried to line them up in a row. But try as he might,\nthe sheep wouldn't line up as Second want! Second had neither the strength nor\nthe ability to untie the sheep so he left them as they are, but with one\ncondition: he wanted to line up the sheep so that the maximum distance between\ntwo tied sheep was as small as possible. The distance between the sheep is the\nnumber of sheep in the ranks that are between these two. Help Second find the\nright arrangement. Input The first input line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n2000). Each of the following n lines contains two integers li and ri (1 \u2264 li,\nri \u2264 10^9; li \u2264 ri). Output In the single output line print n space-separated\nnumbers \u2014 the sought arrangement of the sheep. The i-th value in the line must\nrepresent the number of the sheep that took the i-th place from left in the\noptimal arrangement line. If there are multiple optimal arrangements, print\nany of them. Examples Input 3 1 3 5 7 2 4 Output 1 3 2 Input 5 1 5 2 4 3 6 1 7\n2 6 Output 2 1 3 5 4 Input 4 1 3 4 6 5 7 2 3 Output 1 4 2 3\n\n",
