        "description": "You are given an array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n, where all elements are\ndifferent. You have to perform exactly \n    k\n operations with it. During each\noperation, you do exactly one of the following two actions (you choose which\nto do yourself): find two minimum elements in the array, and delete them; find\nthe maximum element in the array, and delete it. You have to calculate the\nmaximum possible sum of elements in the resulting array. Input The first line\ncontains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    k \n    \u2264 99999\n; \n    2k < n\n) \u2014 the number of elements and operations,\nrespectively. the second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n; all \n    a_i\n are different) \u2014 the\nelements of the array. Additional constraint on the input: the sum of \n    n\n\ndoes not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print one\ninteger \u2014 the maximum possible sum of elements in the resulting array.

In the second testcase, it's optimal to\nfirst erase two minimums, then a maximum.\n\n",
