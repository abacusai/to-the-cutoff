        "description": "After learning a lot about space exploration, a little girl named Ana wants to\nchange the subject. Ana is a girl who loves palindromes (string that can be\nread the same backwards as forward). She has learned how to check for a given\nstring whether it's a palindrome or not, but soon she grew tired of this\nproblem, so she came up with a more interesting one and she needs your help to\nsolve it: You are given an array of strings which consist of only small\nletters of the alphabet. Your task is to find how many palindrome pairs are\nthere in the array. A palindrome pair is a pair of strings such that the\nfollowing condition holds: at least one permutation of the concatenation of\nthe two strings is a palindrome. In other words, if you have two strings,\nlet's say \"aab\" and \"abcac\", and you concatenate them into \"aababcac\", we have\nto check if there exists a permutation of this new string such that it is a\npalindrome (in this case there exists the permutation \"aabccbaa\"). Two pairs\nare considered different if the strings are located on different indices. The\npair of strings with indices \n    (i,j)\n is considered the same as the pair\n\n    (j,i)\n. Input The first line contains a positive integer \n    N\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n), representing the length of the input array. Eacg\nof the next \n    N\n lines contains a string (consisting of lowercase English\nletters from 'a' to 'z') \u2014 an element of the input array. The total number of\ncharacters in the input array will be less than \n    1\n     000\n     000\n. Output\nOutput one number, representing how many palindrome pairs there are in the\narray. Examples Input 3 aa bb cd Output 1 Input 6 aab abcac dffe ed aa aade\nOutput 6 Note The first example: aa \n    +\n bb \n    \u2192\n abba. The second\nexample: aab \n    +\n abcac \n    =\n aababcac \n    \u2192\n aabccbaa aab \n    +\n\naa \n    =\n aabaa abcac \n    +\n aa \n    =\n abcacaa \n    \u2192\n aacbcaa dffe\n\n    +\n ed \n    =\n dffeed \n    \u2192\n fdeedf dffe \n    +\n aade \n    =\n\ndffeaade \n    \u2192\n adfaafde ed \n    +\n aade \n    =\n edaade \n    \u2192\n\naeddea\n\n",
