        "description": "Kamil likes streaming the competitive programming videos. His MeTube channel\nhas recently reached \n    100\n million subscribers. In order to celebrate\nthis, he posted a video with an interesting problem he couldn't solve yet. Can\nyou help him? You're given a tree \u2014 a connected undirected graph consisting of\n\n    n\n vertices connected by \n    n - 1\n edges. The tree is rooted at vertex\n\n    1\n. A vertex \n    u\n is called an ancestor of \n    v\n if it lies on the\nshortest path between the root and \n    v\n. In particular, a vertex is an\nancestor of itself. Each vertex \n    v\n is assigned its beauty \n    x_v\n \u2014 a\nnon-negative integer not larger than \n    10^12\n. This allows us to define\nthe beauty of a path. Let \n    u\n be an ancestor of \n    v\n. Then we define\nthe beauty \n    f(u, v)\n as the greatest common divisor of the beauties of all\nvertices on the shortest path between \n    u\n and \n    v\n. Formally, if\n\n    u=t_1, t_2, t_3, \n    \u2026, t_k=v\n are the vertices on the shortest path\nbetween \n    u\n and \n    v\n, then \n    f(u, v) = \n    (x_t_1, x_t_2,\n    \n    \u2026, x_t_k)\n. Here, \n    \n denotes the greatest common divisor\nof a set of numbers. In particular, \n    f(u, u) = \n    (x_u) = x_u\n. Your\ntask is to find the sum \n    \n\n    \u2211_u\n     is an ancestor of v f(u,\n    v).\n\n    \n As the result might be too large, please output it modulo \n    10^9 +\n    7\n. Note that for each \n    y\n, \n    (0, y) = \n    (y, 0) = y\n. In\nparticular, \n    (0, 0) = 0\n. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of vertices in\nthe tree. The following line contains \n    n\n integers \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026,\n    x_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 10^12\n). The value \n    x_v\n denotes the\nbeauty of vertex \n    v\n. The following \n    n - 1\n lines describe the edges\nof the tree. Each of them contains two integers \n    a, b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b\n    \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    a \n    \u2260 b\n) \u2014 the vertices connected by a single edge.\nOutput Output the sum of the beauties on all paths \n    (u, v)\n such that\n\n    u\n is ancestor of \n    v\n. This sum should be printed modulo \n    10^9 +\n    7\n. Examples Input 5 4 5 6 0 8 1 2 1 3 1 4 4 5 Output 42 Input 7 0 2 3 0 0 0\n0 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 3 6 3 7 Output 30 Note The following figure shows all\n\n    10\n possible paths for which one endpoint is an ancestor of another\nendpoint. The sum of beauties of all these paths is equal to \n    42\n:\n\n",
