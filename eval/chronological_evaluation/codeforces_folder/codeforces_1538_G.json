        "description": "Polycarp has \n    x\n of red and \n    y\n of blue candies. Using them, he wants\nto make gift sets. Each gift set contains either \n    a\n red candies and\n\n    b\n blue candies, or \n    a\n blue candies and \n    b\n red candies. Any\ncandy can belong to at most one gift set. Help Polycarp to find the largest\nnumber of gift sets he can create. For example, if \n    x = 10\n, \n    y = 12\n,\n\n    a = 5\n, and \n    b = 2\n, then Polycarp can make three gift sets: In the\nfirst set there will be \n    5\n red candies and \n    2\n blue candies; In the\nsecond set there will be \n    5\n blue candies and \n    2\n red candies; In the\nthird set will be \n    5\n blue candies and \n    2\n red candies. Note that in\nthis example there is one red candy that Polycarp does not use in any gift\nset. Input The first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n). Then \n    t\n test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single\nstring containing four integers \n    x\n, \n    y\n, \n    a\n, and \n    b\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 x, y, a, b \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Output For each test case, output one number\n\u2014 the maximum number of gift sets that Polycarp can make.
