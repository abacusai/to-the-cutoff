        "description": "You are given \n    n\n strings \n    s_1, s_2, \n    \u2026, s_n\n of length at most\n\n    8\n. For each string \n    s_i\n, determine if there exist two\nstrings \n    s_j\n and \n    s_k\n such that \n    s_i = s_j + s_k\n. That is,\n\n    s_i\n is the concatenation of \n    s_j\n and \n    s_k\n. Note that \n    j\n\ncan be equal to \n    k\n. Recall that the concatenation of strings \n    s\n and\n\n    t\n is \n    s + t = s_1 s_2 \n    \u2026 s_p t_1 t_2 \n    \u2026 t_q\n, where\n\n    p\n and \n    q\n are the lengths of strings \n    s\n and \n    t\n\nrespectively. For example, concatenation of \"code\" and \"forces\" is\n\"codeforces\". Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each\ntest case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of strings. Then \n    n\n lines follow, the \n    i\n-th of which\ncontains non-empty string \n    s_i\n of length at most \n    8\n,\nconsisting of lowercase English letters. Among the given \n    n\n strings,\nthere may be equal (duplicates). The sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoesn't exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output a binary string\nof length \n    n\n. The \n    i\n-th bit should be \n    \n if there\nexist two strings \n    s_j\n and \n    s_k\n where \n    s_i = s_j + s_k\n, and\n\n    \n otherwise. Note that \n    j\n can be equal to \n    k\n.\nExample Input 3 5 abab ab abc abacb c 3 x xx xxx 8 codeforc es codes cod forc\nforces e code Output 10100 011 10100101 Note In the first test case, we have\nthe following: \n    s_1 = s_2 + s_2\n, since \n    = \n    \n    +\n. Remember that \n    j\n can be equal to \n    k\n. \n    s_2\n\nis not the concatenation of any two strings in the list. \n    s_3 = s_2 +\n    s_5\n, since \n    = \n     +\n. \n    s_4\n\nis not the concatenation of any two strings in the list. \n    s_5\n is not the\nconcatenation of any two strings in the list. Since only \n    s_1\n and\n\n    s_3\n satisfy the conditions, only the first and third bits in the answer\nshould be \n    \n, so the answer is \n    \n.\n\n",
