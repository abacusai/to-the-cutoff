        "description": "Ujan has been lazy lately, but now has decided to bring his yard to good\nshape. First, he decided to paint the path from his house to the gate. The\npath consists of \n    n\n consecutive tiles, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n.\nUjan will paint each tile in some color. He will consider the path aesthetic\nif for any two different tiles with numbers \n    i\n and \n    j\n, such that\n\n    |j - i|\n is a divisor of \n    n\n greater than \n    1\n, they have the same\ncolor. Formally, the colors of two tiles with numbers \n    i\n and \n    j\n\nshould be the same if \n    |i-j| > 1\n and \n    n \n     |i-j| = 0\n (where\n\n    x \n     y\n is the remainder when dividing \n    x\n by \n    y\n). Ujan\nwants to brighten up space. What is the maximum number of different colors\nthat Ujan can use, so that the path is aesthetic? Input The first line of\ninput contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^12\n), the\nlength of the path. Output Output a single integer, the maximum possible\nnumber of colors that the path can be painted in. Examples Input 4 Output 2\nInput 5 Output 5 Note In the first sample, two colors is the maximum number.\nTiles \n    1\n and \n    3\n should have the same color since \n    4 \n     |3-1|\n    = 0\n. Also, tiles \n    2\n and \n    4\n should have the same color since \n    4\n    \n     |4-2| = 0\n. In the second sample, all five colors can be used.\n\n",
