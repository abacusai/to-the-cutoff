        "description": "Mio has an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n integers, and an array \n    b\n\nconsisting of \n    m\n integers. Mio can do the following operation to \n    a\n:\nChoose an integer \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) that has not been chosen\nbefore, then add \n    1\n to \n    a_i\n, subtract \n    2\n from \n    a_i+1\n,\nadd \n    3\n to \n    a_i+2\n an so on. Formally, the operation is to add\n\n    (-1)^j-i\n    \u00b7 (j-i+1)\n to \n    a_j\n for \n    i \n    \u2264 j \n    \u2264\n    n\n.Mio wants to transform \n    a\n so that it will contain \n    b\n as a\nsubarray. Could you answer her question, and provide a sequence of operations\nto do so, if it is possible? An array \n    b\n is a subarray of an array\n\n    a\n if \n    b\n can be obtained from \n    a\n by deletion of several\n(possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly,\nzero or all) elements from the end. Input The input consists of multiple test\ncases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of elements in \n    a\n. The second line\nof the test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u22ef, a_n\n\n(\n    -10^5 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^5\n), where \n    a_i\n is the \n    i\n-th\nelement of \n    a\n. The third line of the test case contains one integer\n\n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the number of elements in \n    b\n. The\nfourth line of the test case contains \n    m\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u22ef,\n    b_m\n (\n    -10^12\n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^12\n), where \n    b_i\n is the\n\n    i\n-th element of \n    b\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over\nall test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output If it is\nimpossible to transform \n    a\n so that it contains \n    b\n as a subarray,\noutput \n    -1\n. Otherwise, the first line of output should contain an integer\n\n    k\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n), the number of operations to be done. The\nsecond line should contain \n    k\n distinct integers, representing the\noperations done in order. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any.\nNotice that you do not need to minimize the number of operations. Example\nInput 5 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 2 0 6 0 10 5 1 2 3 4 5 3 3 5 3 8 -3 2 -3 -4 4 0 1 -2 4\n10 -6 7 -7 5 1 2 3 4 5 4 1 10 1 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 10 12 Output 1 1 1 4 5 1 3 4 6\n8 -1 -1 Note In the first test case, the sequence \n    a\n = \n    [1,2,3,4,5]\n.\nOne of the possible solutions is doing one operation at \n    i = 1\n (add\n\n    1\n to \n    a_1\n, subtract \n    2\n from \n    a_2\n, add \n    3\n to\n\n    a_3\n, subtract \n    4\n from \n    a_4\n, add \n    5\n to \n    a_5\n). Then\narray \n    a\n is transformed to \n    a\n = \n    [2,0,6,0,10]\n, which contains\n\n    b\n = \n    [2, 0, 6, 0, 10]\n as a subarray. In the second test case, the\nsequence \n    a\n = \n    [1,2,3,4,5]\n. One of the possible solutions is doing\none operation at \n    i = 4\n (add \n    1\n to \n    a_4\n, subtract \n    2\n from\n\n    a_5\n). Then array \n    a\n is transformed to \n    a\n = \n    [1,2,3,5,3]\n,\nwhich contains \n    b\n = \n    [3,5,3]\n as a subarray. In the third test case,\nthe sequence \n    a\n = \n    [-3, 2, -3, -4, 4, 0, 1, -2]\n. One of the possible\nsolutions is the following. Choose an integer \n    i=8\n to do the operation.\nThen array \n    a\n is transformed to \n    a\n = \n    [-3, 2, -3, -4, 4, 0, 1,\n    -1]\n. Choose an integer \n    i=6\n to do the operation. Then array \n    a\n is\ntransformed to \n    a\n = \n    [-3, 2, -3, -4, 4, 1, -1, 2]\n. Choose an integer\n\n    i=4\n to do the operation. Then array \n    a\n is transformed to \n    a\n =\n\n    [-3, 2, -3, -3, 2, 4, -5, 7]\n. Choose an integer \n    i=3\n to do the\noperation. Then array \n    a\n is transformed to \n    a\n = \n    [-3, 2, -2, -5,\n    5, 0, 0, 1]\n. Choose an integer \n    i=1\n to do the operation. Then array\n\n    a\n is transformed to \n    a\n = \n    [-2, 0, 1, -9, 10, -6, 7, -7]\n. The\nresulting \n    a\n is \n    [-2, 0, 1, -9, 10, -6, 7, -7]\n, which contains\n\n    b\n = \n    [10, -6, 7, -7]\n as a subarray. In the fourth test case, it is\nimpossible to transform \n    a\n so that it contains \n    b\n as a subarray. In\nthe fifth test case, it is impossible to transform \n    a\n so that it contains\n\n    b\n as a subarray.\n\n",
