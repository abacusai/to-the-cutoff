        "description": "Arkadiy has lots square photos with size a \u00d7 a. He wants to put some of them\non a rectangular wall with size h \u00d7 w. The photos which Arkadiy will put on\nthe wall must form a rectangular grid and the distances between neighboring\nvertically and horizontally photos and also the distances between outside rows\nand columns of photos to the nearest bound of the wall must be equal to x,\nwhere x is some non-negative real number. Look on the picture below for better\nunderstanding of the statement. Arkadiy haven't chosen yet how many photos he\nwould put on the wall, however, he want to put at least one photo. Your task\nis to determine the minimum value of x which can be obtained after putting\nphotos, or report that there is no way to put positive number of photos and\nsatisfy all the constraints. Suppose that Arkadiy has enough photos to make\nany valid arrangement according to the constraints. Note that Arkadiy wants to\nput at least one photo on the wall. The photos should not overlap, should\ncompletely lie inside the wall bounds and should have sides parallel to the\nwall sides. Input The first line contains three integers a, h and w (1 \u2264 a, h,\nw \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the size of photos and the height and the width of the wall.\nOutput Print one non-negative real number \u2014 the minimum value of x which can\nbe obtained after putting the photos on the wall. The absolute or the relative\nerror of the answer must not exceed 10^-6. Print -1 if there is no way to put\npositive number of photos and satisfy the constraints. Examples Input 2 18 13\nOutput 0.5 Input 4 4 4 Output 0 Input 3 4 3 Output -1 Note In the first\nexample Arkadiy can put 7 rows of photos with 5 photos in each row, so the\nminimum value of x equals to 0.5. In the second example Arkadiy can put only 1\nphoto which will take the whole wall, so the minimum value of x equals to 0.\nIn the third example there is no way to put positive number of photos and\nsatisfy the constraints described in the statement, so the answer is -1.\n\n",
