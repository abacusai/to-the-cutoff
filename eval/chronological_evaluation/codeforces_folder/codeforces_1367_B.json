        "description": "You are given an array \n    a[0 \n    \u2026 n-1]\n of length \n    n\n which\nconsists of non-negative integers. Note that array indices start from zero. An\narray is called good if the parity of each index matches the parity of the\nelement at that index. More formally, an array is good if for all \n    i\n\n(\n    0 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n - 1\n) the equality \n    i \n     2 = a[i] \n     2\n\nholds, where \n    x \n     2\n is the remainder of dividing \n    x\n by 2. For\nexample, the arrays [\n    0, 5, 2, 1\n] and [\n    0, 17, 0, 3\n] are good, and\nthe array [\n    2, 4, 6, 7\n] is bad, because for \n    i=1\n, the parities of\n\n    i\n and \n    a[i]\n are different: \n    i \n     2 = 1 \n     2 = 1\n, but\n\n    a[i] \n     2 = 4 \n     2 = 0\n. In one move, you can take any two\nelements of the array and swap them (these elements are not necessarily\nadjacent). Find the minimum number of moves in which you can make the array\n\n    a\n good, or say that this is not possible. Input The first line contains\na single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases in the test. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. Each test case starts with\na line containing an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 40\n) \u2014 the length\nof the array \n    a\n. The next line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_0, a_1,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n-1\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the initial array.\nOutput For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of\nmoves to make the given array \n    a\n good, or -1 if this is not possible.\nExample Input 4 4 3 2 7 6 3 3 2 6 1 7 7 4 9 2 1 18 3 0 Output 2 1 -1 0 Note In\nthe first test case, in the first move, you can swap the elements with indices\n\n    0\n and \n    1\n, and in the second move, you can swap the elements with\nindices \n    2\n and \n    3\n. In the second test case, in the first move, you\nneed to swap the elements with indices \n    0\n and \n    1\n. In the third test\ncase, you cannot make the array good.\n\n",
