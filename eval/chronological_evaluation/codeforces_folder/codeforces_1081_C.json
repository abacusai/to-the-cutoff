        "description": "On his free time, Chouti likes doing some housework. He has got one new task,\npaint some bricks in the yard. There are \n    n\n bricks lined in a row on the\nground. Chouti has got \n    m\n paint buckets of different colors at hand, so\nhe painted each brick in one of those \n    m\n colors. Having finished painting\nall bricks, Chouti was satisfied. He stood back and decided to find something\nfun with these bricks. After some counting, he found there are \n    k\n bricks\nwith a color different from the color of the brick on its left (the first\nbrick is not counted, for sure). So as usual, he needs your help in counting\nhow many ways could he paint the bricks. Two ways of painting bricks are\ndifferent if there is at least one brick painted in different colors in these\ntwo ways. Because the answer might be quite big, you only need to output the\nnumber of ways modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Input The first and only line\ncontains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n,m \n    \u2264\n    2000, 0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n-1\n) \u2014 the number of bricks, the number of colors,\nand the number of bricks, such that its color differs from the color of brick\nto the left of it. Output Print one integer \u2014 the number of ways to color\nbricks modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Examples Input 3 3 0 Output 3 Input 3 2\n1 Output 4 Note In the first example, since \n    k=0\n, the color of every\nbrick should be the same, so there will be exactly \n    m=3\n ways to color the\nbricks. In the second example, suppose the two colors in the buckets are\nyellow and lime, the following image shows all \n    4\n possible colorings.\n\n",
