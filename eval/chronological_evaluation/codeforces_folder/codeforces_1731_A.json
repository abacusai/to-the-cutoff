        "name": "Joey Takes Money",
        "description": "Joey is low on money. His friend Chandler wants to lend Joey some money, but\ncan't give him directly, as Joey is too proud of himself to accept it. So, in\norder to trick him, Chandler asks Joey to play a game. In this game, Chandler\ngives Joey an array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    n \n    \u2265 2\n) of\npositive integers (\n    a_i \n    \u2265 1\n). Joey can perform the following\noperation on the array any number of times: Take two indices \n    i\n and\n\n    j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i < j \n    \u2264 n)\n. Choose two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n\n(\n    x, y \n    \u2265 1\n) such that \n    x \n    \u00b7 y = a_i \n    \u00b7 a_j\n. Replace\n\n    a_i\n by \n    x\n and \n    a_j\n by \n    y\n. In the end, Joey will get the\nmoney equal to the sum of elements of the final array. Find the maximum amount\nof money \n    ans\n Joey can get but print \n    2022 \n    \u00b7\n    ans\n. Why multiplied by \n    2022\n? Because we are never gonna\nsee it again! It is guaranteed that the product of all the elements of the\narray \n    a\n doesn't exceed \n    10^12\n. Input Each test contains multiple\ntest cases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 4000\n). Description of the test cases follows. The first\nline of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    50\n) \u2014 the length of the array \n    a\n. The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the\narray itself. It's guaranteed that the product of all \n    a_i\n doesn't exceed\n\n    10^12\n (i. e. \n    a_1 \n    \u00b7 a_2 \n    \u00b7\n    \u2026\n    \u00b7 a_n \n    \u2264\n    10^12\n). Output For each test case, print the maximum money Joey can get\nmultiplied by \n    2022\n. Example Input 3 3 2 3 2 2 1 3 3 1000000 1000000 1\nOutput 28308 8088 2022000000004044 Note In the first test case, Joey can do\nthe following: He chooses \n    i = 1\n and \n    j = 2\n (so he has \n    a[i]\n    \n    \u00b7 a[j] = 6\n), chooses \n    x = 6\n and \n    y = 1\n and makes \n    a[i] =\n    6\n and \n    a[j] = 1\n. \n    \n\n    [2, 3, 2] \n     [6, 1, 2]\n\n    \n He chooses \n    i = 1\n and \n    j = 3\n (so he\nhas \n    a[i] \n    \u00b7 a[j] = 12\n), chooses \n    x = 12\n and \n    y = 1\n and\nmakes \n    a[i] = 12\n and \n    a[j] = 1\n. \n    \n\n    [6, 1, 2] \n     [12, 1, 1]\n\n    \n The sum is \n    14\n which is\nthe maximum of all possible sums. The answer is \n    2022 \n    \u00b7 14 = 28308\n.\n\n",
