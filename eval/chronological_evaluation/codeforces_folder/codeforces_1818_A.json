        "description": "In a debate club with \n    n\n members, including yourself (member \n    1\n),\nthere are \n    k\n opinions to be discussed in sequence. During each\ndiscussion, members express their agreement or disagreement with the opinion.\nLet's define \n    Y\n as the number of members who agree and \n    N\n as the\nnumber of members who disagree. After each discussion, members leave the club\nbased on the following criteria: If more members agree than disagree (\n    Y >\n    N\n), all members who disagreed leave the club. If more members disagree than\nagree (\n    Y < N\n), all members who agreed leave the club. If there is a tie\n(\n    Y = N\n), all members leave the club. As the club president, your goal is\nto stay in the club and maximize the number of members remaining after the\nmeeting. You have access to each member's stance on all \n    k\n opinions\nbefore the meeting starts, and you can expel any number of members (excluding\nyourself) before the meeting begins. Determine the maximum number of members,\nincluding yourself, who can remain in the club after the meeting. You don't\nneed to provide the specific expulsion strategy but only the maximum number of\nmembers that can stay. Ensure that you remain in the club after the meeting as\nwell. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains\nthe number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n). Description of\nthe test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two positive\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, k \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of\nmembers and the number of discussions. The \n    i\n-th of the following \n    n\n\nlines contains a string \n    t_i\n of length \n    k\n. The \n    j\n-th character\nin the string \n    t_i\n indicates whether the \n    i\n-th member agrees or\ndisagrees with the \n    j\n-th opinion if they are present during that\ndiscussion. A \"+\" symbol means the member agrees, while a \"-\" symbol means the\nmember disagrees. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n \n    \u00b7 k\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    5 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n. Output For each test case,\noutput the maximum number of members, including yourself, who can remain in\nthe club after the meeting. Example Input 5 2 2 ++ +- 1 3 +-+ 4 1  \u00ad \u00ad \n5 4 ++++ +\u2013+ ++-+ +-++ ++++ 4 2 ++ \u00ad- \u00ad- -+ Output 1 1 2 2 1 Note For\nconvenience, we will analyze the examples based on who actually attended the\nmeeting (i. e. was not expelled) rather than who was expelled. Example 1: Only\nthe first member could have attended the meeting, otherwise both members would\nhave left after the second opinion is discussed. Example 2: There is only a\nsingle member that attends the meeting and stays till the end. Example 3: The\nclub has \n    4\n members and only one opinion will be discussed during the\nmeeting. Let's analyze the possible outcomes based on the participants in the\nmeeting: If only the first member attends, they'll be the only one left after\nthe meeting. If the first member attends with the second or third member, they\nwill be a tie in the discussion, making them both leave. If the first member\nattends with the second and third members, the first member will be in the\nminority and will leave after the discussion, which contradicts the statement.\nIf the first and fourth members attend, they will agree during the discussion\nand both remain till the end. If the first, second, and fourth members attend,\nthe second member will be in the minority during the discussion, and only the\nfirst and fourth members will remain at the end. The same happens if the\nsecond member is replaced by the third member. If all four members attend,\nthere will be a tie during the discussion, making everyone leave. The maximum\nnumber of members remaining after the meeting is \n    2\n. Example 4: The club\nhas \n    5\n members and \n    4\n opinions will be discussed during the meeting.\nOne way to achieve the maximum number of members is if only the first, third,\nand fifth members attend the meeting. In this case, they all agree during the\nfirst two discussions, after which the third member is in the minority during\nthe third discussion. Then, the first and fifth members agree in the last\ndiscussion, and those two members stay till the end of the meeting. Example 5:\nThe club has \n    4\n members and \n    2\n opinions will be discussed. If the\nfirst three members attend the meeting, the first member will be in the\nminority during the first discussion and will leave the club. After that, the\nsecond and third members will both disagree with the second opinion, and they\nboth will stay till the end of the meeting. In this way, there will be 2\nmembers left after the meeting, but it is an invalid outcome, as it forces the\nfirst member to leave. Therefore, the maximum number of 1 member is achieved\nif only the first member attends the meeting.\n\n",
