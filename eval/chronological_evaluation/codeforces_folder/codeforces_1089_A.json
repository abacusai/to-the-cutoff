        "description": "Alice is a big fan of volleyball and especially of the very strong \"Team A\".\nVolleyball match consists of up to five sets. During each set teams score one\npoint for winning a ball. The first four sets are played until one of the\nteams scores at least 25 points and the fifth set is played until one of the\nteams scores at least 15 points. Moreover, if one of the teams scores 25 (or\n15 in the fifth set) points while the other team scores 24 (or 14 in the fifth\nset), the set is played until the absolute difference between teams' points\nbecomes two. The match ends when one of the teams wins three sets. The match\nscore is the number of sets won by each team. Alice found a book containing\nall the results of all matches played by \"Team A\". The book is old, and some\nparts of the book became unreadable. Alice can not read the information on how\nmany sets each of the teams won, she can not read the information on how many\npoints each of the teams scored in each set, she even does not know the number\nof sets played in a match. The only information she has is the total number of\npoints scored by each of the teams in all the sets during a single match.\nAlice wonders what is the best match score \"Team A\" could achieve in each of\nthe matches. The bigger is the difference between the number of sets won by\n\"Team A\" and their opponent, the better is the match score. Find the best\nmatch score or conclude that no match could end like that. If there is a\nsolution, then find any possible score for each set that results in the best\nmatch score. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    m\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 50\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of matches found by Alice in the\nbook. Each of the next \n    m\n lines contains two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n\n(\n    0 \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the number of points scored by \"Team A\" and\nthe number of points scored by their opponents respectively. Output Output the\nsolution for every match in the same order as they are given in the input. If\nthe teams could not score \n    a\n and \n    b\n points respectively, output\n\"Impossible\". Otherwise, output the match score formatted as\n\"\n    x\n:\n    y\n\", where \n    x\n is the number of sets won by \"Team A\" and\n\n    y\n is the number of sets won by their opponent. The next line should\ncontain the set scores in the order they were played. Each set score should be\nprinted in the same format as the match score, with \n    x\n being the number\nof points scored by \"Team A\" in this set, and \n    y\n being the number of\npoints scored by their opponent. Example Input 6 75 0 90 90 20 0 0 75 78 50 80\n100 Output 3:0 25:0 25:0 25:0 3:1 25:22 25:22 15:25 25:21 Impossible 0:3 0:25\n0:25 0:25 3:0 25:11 28:26 25:13 3:2 25:17 0:25 25:22 15:25 15:11\n\n",
