        "name": "Parking Lot",
        "description": "A parking lot in the City consists of n parking spaces, standing in a line.\nThe parking spaces are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. When a car\narrives at the lot, the operator determines an empty parking space for it. For\nthe safety's sake the chosen place should be located as far from the already\noccupied places as possible. That is, the closest occupied parking space must\nbe as far away as possible. If there are several such places, then the\noperator chooses the place with the minimum index from them. If all parking\nlot places are empty, then the car gets place number 1. We consider the\ndistance between the i-th and the j-th parking spaces equal to 4\u00b7|i - j|\nmeters. You are given the parking lot records of arriving and departing cars\nin the chronological order. For each record of an arriving car print the\nnumber of the parking lot that was given to this car. Input The first line\ncontains two space-separated integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number\nof parking places and the number of records correspondingly. Next m lines\ncontain the descriptions of the records, one per line. The i-th line contains\nnumbers ti, idi (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 2; 1 \u2264 idi \u2264 10^6). If ti equals 1, then the\ncorresponding record says that the car number idi arrived at the parking lot.\nIf ti equals 2, then the corresponding record says that the car number idi\ndeparted from the parking lot. Records about arriving to the parking lot and\ndeparting from the parking lot are given chronologically. All events occurred\nconsecutively, no two events occurred simultaneously. It is guaranteed that\nall entries are correct: each car arrived at the parking lot at most once and\ndeparted from the parking lot at most once, there is no record of a departing\ncar if it didn't arrive at the parking lot earlier, there are no more than n\ncars on the parking lot at any moment. You can consider the cars arbitrarily\nnumbered from 1 to 10^6, all numbers are distinct. Initially all places in the\nparking lot are empty. Output For each entry of an arriving car print the\nnumber of its parking space. Print the numbers of the spaces in the order, in\nwhich the cars arrive to the parking lot.
