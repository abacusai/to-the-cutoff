        "name": "One Billion Shades of Grey",
        "description": "You have to paint with shades of grey the tiles of an \n    n\n    \u00d7 n\n wall.\nThe wall has \n    n\n rows of tiles, each with \n    n\n tiles. The tiles on the\nboundary of the wall (i.e., on the first row, last row, first column and last\ncolumn) are already painted and you shall not change their color. All the\nother tiles are not painted. Some of the tiles are broken, you shall not paint\nthose tiles. It is guaranteed that the tiles on the boundary are not broken.\nYou shall paint all the non-broken tiles that are not already painted. When\nyou paint a tile you can choose from \n    10^9\n shades of grey, indexed from\n\n    1\n to \n    10^9\n. You can paint multiple tiles with the same shade.\nFormally, painting the wall is equivalent to assigning a shade (an integer\nbetween \n    1\n and \n    10^9\n) to each non-broken tile that is not already\npainted. The contrast between two tiles is the absolute value of the\ndifference between the shades of the two tiles. The total contrast of the wall\nis the sum of the contrast of all the pairs of adjacent non-broken tiles (two\ntiles are adjacent if they share a side). Compute the minimum possible total\ncontrast of the wall. Input The first line contains \n    n\n (\n    3\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264\n    200\n) \u2013 the number of rows and columns. Then \n    n\n lines, each containing\n\n    n\n integers, follow. The \n    i\n-th of these lines describe the\n\n    i\n-th row of tiles. It contains the \n    n\n integers \n    a_ij\n\n(\n    -1\n    \u2264 a_ij\n    \u2264 10^9)\n. The value of \n    a_ij\n described the\ntile on the \n    i\n-th row and \n    j\n-th column: If \n    a_ij=0\n, then the\ntile is not painted and shall be painted. If \n    a_ij=-1\n, then the tile is\nbroken and shall not be painted. If \n    1\n    \u2264 a_ij\n    \u2264 10^9\n, then the\ntile is already painted with the shade \n    a_ij\n. It is guaranteed that the\ntiles on the boundary are already painted, the tiles not on the boundary are\nnot already painted, and the tiles on the boundary are not broken. Output\nPrint a single integer \u2013 the minimum possible total contrast of the wall.\nExamples Input 3 1 7 6 4 0 6 1 1 1 Output 26 Input 3 10 100 1 1 -1 100 10 10\n10 Output 396 Input 5 6 6 5 4 4 6 0 0 0 4 7 0 0 0 3 8 0 0 0 2 8 8 1 2 2 Output\n34 Input 7 315055237 841510063 581663979 148389224 405375301 243686840\n882512379 683199716 -1 -1 0 0 0 346177625 496442279 0 0 0 0 0 815993623\n223938231 0 0 -1 0 0 16170511 44132173 0 -1 0 0 0 130735659 212201259 0 0 -1 0\n0 166102576 123213235 506794677 467013743 410119347 791447348 80193382\n142887538 Output 10129482893 Note Explanation of the first testcase: The\ninitial configuration of the tiles is (tiles to paint are denoted by ?): 1 7 6\n4 ? 6 1 1 1 A possible way to paint the tile achieving the minimum possible\ncontrast of \n    26\n is: 1 7 6 4 5 6 1 1 1 Explanation of the second testcase:\nSince all tiles are either painted or broken, there is nothing to do.
