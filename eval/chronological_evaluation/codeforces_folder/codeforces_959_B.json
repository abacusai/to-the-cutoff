        "description": "Mahmoud wants to send a message to his friend Ehab. Their language consists of\nn words numbered from 1 to n. Some words have the same meaning so there are k\ngroups of words such that all the words in some group have the same meaning.\nMahmoud knows that the i-th word can be sent with cost ai. For each word in\nhis message, Mahmoud can either replace it with another word of the same\nmeaning or leave it as it is. Can you help Mahmoud determine the minimum cost\nof sending the message? The cost of sending the message is the sum of the\ncosts of sending every word in it. Input The first line of input contains\nintegers n, k and m (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of words in\ntheir language, the number of groups of words, and the number of words in\nMahmoud's message respectively. The second line contains n strings consisting\nof lowercase English letters of length not exceeding 20 which represent the\nwords. It's guaranteed that the words are distinct. The third line contains n\nintegers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9) where ai is the cost of sending the\ni-th word. The next k lines describe the groups of words of same meaning. The\nnext k lines each start with an integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 n) which means that there\nare x words in this group, followed by x integers which represent the indices\nof words in this group. It's guaranteed that each word appears in exactly one\ngroup. The next line contains m space-separated words which represent\nMahmoud's message. Each of these words appears in the list of language's\nwords. Output The only line should contain the minimum cost to send the\nmessage after replacing some words (maybe none) with some words of the same\nmeaning. Examples Input 5 4 4 i loser am the second 100 1 1 5 10 1 1 1 3 2 2 5\n1 4 i am the second Output 107 Input 5 4 4 i loser am the second 100 20 1 5 10\n1 1 1 3 2 2 5 1 4 i am the second Output 116 Note In the first sample, Mahmoud\nshould replace the word \"second\" with the word \"loser\" because it has less\ncost so the cost will be 100+1+5+1=107. In the second sample, Mahmoud\nshouldn't do any replacement so the cost will be 100+1+5+10=116.\n\n",
