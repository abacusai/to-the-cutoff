        "description": "Statistics claims that students sleep no more than three hours a day. But even\nin the world of their dreams, while they are snoring peacefully, the sense of\nimpending doom is still upon them. A poor student is dreaming that he is\nsitting the mathematical analysis exam. And he is examined by the most\nformidable professor of all times, a three times Soviet Union Hero, a Noble\nPrize laureate in student expulsion, venerable Petr Palych. The poor student\ncouldn't answer a single question. Thus, instead of a large spacious office he\nis going to apply for a job to thorium mines. But wait a minute! Petr Palych\ndecided to give the student the last chance! Yes, that is possible only in\ndreams. So the professor began: \"Once a Venusian girl and a Marsian boy met on\nthe Earth and decided to take a walk holding hands. But the problem is the\ngirl has al fingers on her left hand and ar fingers on the right one. The boy\ncorrespondingly has bl and br fingers. They can only feel comfortable when\nholding hands, when no pair of the girl's fingers will touch each other. That\nis, they are comfortable when between any two girl's fingers there is a boy's\nfinger. And in addition, no three fingers of the boy should touch each other.\nDetermine if they can hold hands so that the both were comfortable.\" The boy\nany the girl don't care who goes to the left and who goes to the right. The\ndifference is only that if the boy goes to the left of the girl, he will take\nher left hand with his right one, and if he goes to the right of the girl,\nthen it is vice versa. Input The first line contains two positive integers not\nexceeding 100. They are the number of fingers on the Venusian girl's left and\nright hand correspondingly. The second line contains two integers not\nexceeding 100. They are the number of fingers on the Marsian boy's left and\nright hands correspondingly. Output Print YES or NO, that is, the answer to\nPetr Palych's question. Examples Input 5 1 10 5 Output YES Input 4 5 3 3\nOutput YES Input 1 2 11 6 Output NO Note The boy and the girl don't really\ncare who goes to the left.\n\n",
