        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n and array \n    b\n of length\n\n    m\n both consisting of only integers \n    0\n and \n    1\n. Consider a\nmatrix \n    c\n of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n formed by following rule: \n    c_i,\n    j = a_i \n    \u00b7 b_j\n (i.e. \n    a_i\n multiplied by \n    b_j\n). It's easy to\nsee that \n    c\n consists of only zeroes and ones too. How many subrectangles\nof size (area) \n    k\n consisting only of ones are there in \n    c\n? A\nsubrectangle is an intersection of a consecutive (subsequent) segment of rows\nand a consecutive (subsequent) segment of columns. I.e. consider four integers\n\n    x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_1 \n    \u2264 x_2 \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 y_1\n    \n    \u2264 y_2 \n    \u2264 m\n) a subrectangle \n    c[x_1 \n    \u2026 x_2][y_1 \n    \u2026 y_2]\n\nis an intersection of the rows \n    x_1, x_1+1, x_1+2, \n    \u2026, x_2\n and the\ncolumns \n    y_1, y_1+1, y_1+2, \n    \u2026, y_2\n. The size (area) of a\nsubrectangle is the total number of cells in it. Input The first line contains\nthree integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264\n    40\n     000, 1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u00b7 m\n), length of array \n    a\n, length\nof array \n    b\n and required size of subrectangles. The second line contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 1\n),\nelements of \n    a\n. The third line contains \n    m\n integers \n    b_1, b_2,\n    \n    \u2026, b_m\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 1\n), elements of \n    b\n. Output\nOutput single integer \u2014 the number of subrectangles of \n    c\n with size\n(area) \n    k\n consisting only of ones. Examples Input 3 3 2 1 0 1 1 1 1\nOutput 4 Input 3 5 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 14 Note In first example matrix\n\n    c\n is: There are \n    4\n subrectangles of size \n    2\n consisting of only\nones in it: In second example matrix \n    c\n is:\n\n",
