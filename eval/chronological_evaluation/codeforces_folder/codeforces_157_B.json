        "description": "One day, as Sherlock Holmes was tracking down one very important criminal, he\nfound a wonderful painting on the wall. This wall could be represented as a\nplane. The painting had several concentric circles that divided the wall into\nseveral parts. Some parts were painted red and all the other were painted\nblue. Besides, any two neighboring parts were painted different colors, that\nis, the red and the blue color were alternating, i. e. followed one after the\nother. The outer area of the wall (the area that lied outside all circles) was\npainted blue. Help Sherlock Holmes determine the total area of red parts of\nthe wall. Let us remind you that two circles are called concentric if their\ncenters coincide. Several circles are called concentric if any two of them are\nconcentric. Input The first line contains the single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100).\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers ri (1 \u2264 ri \u2264 1000) \u2014 the\ncircles' radii. It is guaranteed that all circles are different. Output Print\nthe single real number \u2014 total area of the part of the wall that is painted\nred. The answer is accepted if absolute or relative error doesn't exceed\n10^-4. Examples Input 1 1 Output 3.1415926536 Input 3 1 4 2 Output\n40.8407044967 Note In the first sample the picture is just one circle of\nradius 1. Inner part of the circle is painted red. The area of the red part\nequals \u03c0 \u00d7 1^2 = \u03c0. In the second sample there are three circles of radii 1, 4\nand 2. Outside part of the second circle is painted blue. Part between the\nsecond and the third circles is painted red. Part between the first and the\nthird is painted blue. And, finally, the inner part of the first circle is\npainted red. Overall there are two red parts: the ring between the second and\nthe third circles and the inner part of the first circle. Total area of the\nred parts is equal (\u03c0 \u00d7 4^2 - \u03c0 \u00d7 2^2) + \u03c0 \u00d7 1^2 = \u03c0 \u00d7 12 + \u03c0 = 13\u03c0\n\n",
