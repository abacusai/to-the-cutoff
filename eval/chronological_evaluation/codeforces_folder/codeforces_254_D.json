        "name": "Rats",
        "description": "Rats have bred to hundreds and hundreds in the basement of the store, owned by\nVasily Petrovich. Vasily Petrovich may have not noticed their presence, but\nthey got into the habit of sneaking into the warehouse and stealing food from\nthere. Vasily Petrovich cannot put up with it anymore, he has to destroy the\nrats in the basement. Since mousetraps are outdated and do not help, and rat\npoison can poison inattentive people as well as rats, he chose a radical way:\nto blow up two grenades in the basement (he does not have more). In this\nproblem, we will present the shop basement as a rectangular table of n \u00d7 m\ncells. Some of the cells are occupied by walls, and the rest of them are\nempty. Vasily has been watching the rats and he found out that at a certain\ntime they go to sleep, and all the time they sleep in the same places. He\nwants to blow up a grenade when this convenient time comes. On the plan of his\nbasement, he marked cells with sleeping rats in them. Naturally, these cells\nare not occupied by walls. Grenades can only blow up in a cell that is not\noccupied by a wall. The blast wave from a grenade distributes as follows. We\nassume that the grenade blast occurs at time 0. During this initial time only\nthe cell where the grenade blew up gets 'clear'. If at time t some cell is\nclear, then at time t + 1 those side-neighbouring cells which are not occupied\nby the walls get clear too (some of them could have been cleared before). The\nblast wave distributes for exactly d seconds, then it dies immediately. An\nexample of a distributing blast wave: Picture 1 shows the situation before the\nblast, and the following pictures show \"clear\" cells by time 0,1,2,3 and 4.\nThus, the blast wave on the picture distributes for d = 4 seconds. Vasily\nPetrovich wonders, whether he can choose two cells to blast the grenades so as\nto clear all cells with sleeping rats. Write the program that finds it out.\nInput The first line contains three integers n, m and d, separated by single\nspaces (4 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 d \u2264 8). Next n lines contain the table that\nrepresents the basement plan. Each row of the table consists of m characters.\nCharacter \"X\" means that the corresponding cell is occupied by the wall,\ncharacter \".\" represents a empty cell, character \"R\" represents a empty cell\nwith sleeping rats. It is guaranteed that the first and the last row, as well\nas the first and the last column consist of characters \"X\". The plan has at\nleast two empty cells. There is at least one cell with sleeping rats. Output\nIf it is impossible to blow up all cells with sleeping rats, print a single\ninteger -1. Otherwise, print four space-separated integers r1, c1, r2, c2,\nthat mean that one grenade should go off in cell (r1, c1), and the other one \u2014\nin cell (r2, c2). Consider the table rows numbered from top to bottom from 1\nto n and the table columns \u2014 from left to right from 1 to m. As r1 and r2\nrepresent the row numbers, and c1 and c2 represent the column numbers in the\ntable, they should fit the limits: 1 \u2264 r1, r2 \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c1, c2 \u2264 m. It is\nforbidden to blow a grenade twice in the same cell. The blast waves of the\ngrenades can intersect. It is possible that one grenade blast destroys no\nrats, and the other one destroys all of them.
