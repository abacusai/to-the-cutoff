        "description": "Monocarp is playing a MMORPG. There are two commonly used types of currency in\nthis MMORPG \u2014 gold coins and silver coins. Monocarp wants to buy a new weapon\nfor his character, and that weapon costs \n    n\n silver coins. Unfortunately,\nright now, Monocarp has no coins at all. Monocarp can earn gold coins by\ncompleting quests in the game. Each quest yields exactly one gold coin.\nMonocarp can also exchange coins via the in-game trading system. Monocarp has\nspent days analyzing the in-game economy; he came to the following conclusion:\nit is possible to sell one gold coin for \n    a\n silver coins (i. e. Monocarp\ncan lose one gold coin to gain \n    a\n silver coins), or buy one gold coin for\n\n    b\n silver coins (i. e. Monocarp can lose \n    b\n silver coins to gain one\ngold coin). Now Monocarp wants to calculate the minimum number of quests that\nhe has to complete in order to have at least \n    n\n silver coins after some\nabuse of the in-game economy. Note that Monocarp can perform exchanges of both\ntypes (selling and buying gold coins for silver coins) any number of times.\nInput The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing\nthree integers \n    n\n, \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^7\n; \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 50\n). Output For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the\nminimum possible number of quests Monocarp has to complete. Example Input 4\n100 25 30 9999997 25 50 52 50 48 49 50 1 Output 4 400000 1 1 Note In the first\ntest case of the example, Monocarp should complete \n    4\n quests, and then\nsell \n    4\n gold coins for \n    100\n silver coins. In the second test case,\nMonocarp should complete \n    400000\n quests, and then sell \n    400000\n gold\ncoins for \n    10\n million silver coins. In the third test case, Monocarp\nshould complete \n    1\n quest, sell the gold coin for \n    50\n silver coins,\nbuy a gold coin for \n    48\n silver coins, and then sell it again for \n    50\n\ncoins. So, he will have \n    52\n silver coins. In the fourth test case,\nMonocarp should complete \n    1\n quest and then sell the gold coin he has\nobtained for \n    50\n silver coins.\n\n",
