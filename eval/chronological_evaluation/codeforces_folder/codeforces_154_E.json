        "name": "Martian Colony",
        "description": "The first ship with the Earth settlers landed on Mars. The colonists managed\nto build n necessary structures on the surface of the planet (which can be\nregarded as a plane, and the construction can be regarded as points on it).\nBut one day the scanners recorded suspicious activity on the outskirts of the\ncolony. It was decided to use the protective force field generating system to\nprotect the colony against possible trouble. The system works as follows: the\nsurface contains a number of generators of the field (they can also be\nconsidered as points). The active range of each generator is a circle of\nradius r centered at the location of the generator (the boundary of the circle\nis also included in the range). After the system is activated, it stretches\nthe protective force field only over the part of the surface, which is within\nthe area of all generators' activity. That is, the protected part is the\nintersection of the generators' active ranges. The number of generators\navailable to the colonists is not limited, but the system of field generation\nconsumes a lot of energy. More precisely, the energy consumption does not\ndepend on the number of generators, but it is directly proportional to the\narea, which is protected by the field. Also, it is necessary that all the\nexisting buildings are located within the protected area. Determine the\nsmallest possible area of the protected part of the surface containing all the\nbuildings. Input The first line contains two integers n and r (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1\n\u2264 r \u2264 50000) \u2014 the number of buildings and the active ranges of the\ngenerators, correspondingly. Next n lines contains the buildings' coordinates.\nThe i + 1-th (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) line contains two real numbers with at most three\ndigits after the decimal point xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| \u2264 50000) \u2014 coordinates of\nthe i-th building. It is guaranteed that no two buildings are located at the\nsame point, and no two different buildings are located closer than 1. It is\nguaranteed that there exists a circle with radius r that contains all the\nbuildings. Output Print the single real number \u2014 the minimum area of the\nprotected part containing all the buildings. The answer is accepted if\nabsolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^-4. Examples Input 3 5 0.00 0.000\n0.0 8.00 6 8.00 Output 78.5398163397 Input 4 1000 0.0 0.0 0 2.00 2.00 2 2.0\n0.00 Output 4.0026666140 Input 4 5 3.00 0.0 -3 0.00 0.000 1 0.0 -1.00 Output\n8.1750554397 Note In the first sample the given radius equals the radius of\nthe circle circumscribed around the given points. That's why the circle that\ncorresponds to it is the sought area. The answer is 25\u03c0. In the second sample\nthe area nearly coincides with the square which has vertexes in the given\npoints. The area for the third sample is shown on the picture below.\n\n",
