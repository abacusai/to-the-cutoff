        "description": "Petr likes to come up with problems about randomly generated data. This time\nproblem is about random permutation. He decided to generate a random\npermutation this way: he takes identity permutation of numbers from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n and then \n    3n\n times takes a random pair of different elements and\nswaps them. Alex envies Petr and tries to imitate him in all kind of things.\nAlex has also come up with a problem about random permutation. He generates a\nrandom permutation just like Petr but swaps elements \n    7n+1\n times instead\nof \n    3n\n times. Because it is more random, OK?! You somehow get a test from\none of these problems and now you want to know from which one. Input In the\nfirst line of input there is one integer \n    n\n (\n    10^3\n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^6\n). In the second line there are \n    n\n distinct integers between\n\n    1\n and \n    n\n \u2014 the permutation of size \n    n\n from the test. It is\nguaranteed that all tests except for sample are generated this way: First we\nchoose \n    n\n \u2014 the size of the permutation. Then we randomly choose a method\nto generate a permutation \u2014 the one of Petr or the one of Alex. Then we\ngenerate a permutation using chosen method. Output If the test is generated\nvia Petr's method print \"Petr\" (without quotes). If the test is generated via\nAlex's method print \"Um_nik\" (without quotes). Example Input 5 2 4 5 1 3\nOutput Petr Note Please note that the sample is not a valid test (because of\nlimitations for \n    n\n) and is given only to illustrate input/output format.\nYour program still has to print correct answer to this test to get AC. Due to\nrandomness of input hacks in this problem are forbidden.\n\n",
