        "description": "You are playing a computer game. In this game, you have to fight \n    n\n\nmonsters. To defend from monsters, you need a shield. Each shield has two\nparameters: its current durability \n    a\n and its defence rating \n    b\n.\nEach monster has only one parameter: its strength \n    d\n. When you fight a\nmonster with strength \n    d\n while having a shield with current durability\n\n    a\n and defence \n    b\n, there are three possible outcomes: if \n    a =\n    0\n, then you receive \n    d\n damage; if \n    a > 0\n and \n    d \n    \u2265 b\n, you\nreceive no damage, but the current durability of the shield decreases by\n\n    1\n; if \n    a > 0\n and \n    d < b\n, nothing happens. The \n    i\n-th\nmonster has strength \n    d_i\n, and you will fight each of the monsters\nexactly once, in some random order (all \n    n!\n orders are equiprobable). You\nhave to consider \n    m\n different shields, the \n    i\n-th shield has initial\ndurability \n    a_i\n and defence rating \n    b_i\n. For each shield, calculate\nthe expected amount of damage you will receive if you take this shield and\nfight the given \n    n\n monsters in random order. Input The first line\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of monsters and the number of shields, respectively. The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    d_1\n, \n    d_2\n, ..., \n    d_n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 d_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), where \n    d_i\n is the strength of the\n\n    i\n-th monster. Then \n    m\n lines follow, the \n    i\n-th of them contains\ntwo integers \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the description of the \n    i\n-th shield. Output Print\n\n    m\n integers, where the \n    i\n-th integer represents the expected damage\nyou receive with the \n    i\n-th shield as follows: it can be proven that, for\neach shield, the expected damage is an irreducible fraction\n\n    xy\n, where \n    y\n is coprime with \n    998244353\n. You have\nto print the value of \n    x \n    \u00b7 y^-1\n     998244353\n, where\n\n    y^-1\n is the inverse element for \n    y\n (\n    y \n    \u00b7 y^-1\n    \n    998244353 = 1\n).
