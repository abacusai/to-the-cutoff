        "description": "Alice and Bob play a game. Initially they have a string \n    s_1, s_2, \n    \u2026,\n    s_n\n, consisting of only characters . and X. They take alternating turns,\nand Alice is moving first. During each turn, the player has to select a\ncontiguous substring consisting only of characters . and replaces each of them\nwith X. Alice must select a substing of length \n    a\n, and Bob must select a\nsubstring of length \n    b\n. It is guaranteed that \n    a > b\n. For example,\nif \n    s =\n ...X.. and \n    a = 3\n, \n    b = 2\n, then after Alice's move\nstring can turn only into XXXX... And if it's Bob's turn and the string \n    s\n    =\n ...X.., then after Bob's move the string can turn into XX.X.., .XXX.. or\n...XXX. Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. You have to determine who\nwins if they both play optimally. You have to answer \n    q\n independent\nqueries. Input The first line contains one integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264\n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of queries. The first line of each query\ncontains two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b < a \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n). The second line of each query contains the string \n    s\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 |s| \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n), consisting of only characters . and X. It\nis guaranteed that sum of all \n    |s|\n over all queries not exceed \n    3\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case print YES if Alice can win and NO\notherwise. You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example,\nthe strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).\nExample Input 3 3 2 XX......XX...X 4 2 X...X.X..X 5 3 .......X..X Output YES\nNO YES Note In the first query Alice can select substring \n    s_3 \n    \u2026\n    s_5\n. After that \n    s\n turns into XXXXX...XX...X. After that, no matter\nwhat move Bob makes, Alice can make the move (this will be her second move),\nbut Bob can't make his second move. In the second query Alice can not win\nbecause she cannot even make one move. In the third query Alice can choose\nsubstring \n    s_2 \n    \u2026 s_6\n. After that \n    s\n turns into .XXXXX.X..X,\nand Bob can't make a move after that.\n\n",
