        "description": "There are \n    n\n weighted points on the \n    OX\n-axis. The coordinate and the\nweight of the \n    i\n-th point is \n    x_i\n and \n    w_i\n, respectively. All\npoints have distinct coordinates and positive weights. Also, \n    x_i < x_i +\n    1\n holds for any \n    1 \n    \u2264 i < n\n. The weighted distance between\n\n    i\n-th point and \n    j\n-th point is defined as \n    |x_i - x_j| \n    \u00b7\n    (w_i + w_j)\n, where \n    |val|\n denotes the absolute value of \n    val\n. You\nshould answer \n    q\n queries, where the \n    i\n-th query asks the following:\nFind the minimum weighted distance among all pairs of distinct points among\nthe points in subarray \n    [l_i,r_i]\n. Input The first line contains 2\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    q\n \n    (2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5; 1 \n    \u2264 q\n    \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5)\n \u2014 the number of points and the number of queries.\nThen, \n    n\n lines follows, the \n    i\n-th of them contains two integers\n\n    x_i\n and \n    w_i\n \n    (-10^9 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 10^9; 1 \n    \u2264 w_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9)\n \u2014 the coordinate and the weight of the \n    i\n-th point. It is\nguaranteed that the points are given in the increasing order of \n    x\n. Then,\n\n    q\n lines follows, the \n    i\n-th of them contains two integers \n    l_i\n\nand \n    r_i\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 l_i < r_i \n    \u2264 n)\n \u2014 the given subarray of the\n\n    i\n-th query. Output For each query output one integer, the minimum\nweighted distance among all pair of distinct points in the given subarray.\nExample Input 5 5 -2 2 0 10 1 1 9 2 12 7 1 3 2 3 1 5 3 5 2 4 Output 9 11 9 24\n11 Note For the first query, the minimum weighted distance is between points\n\n    1\n and \n    3\n, which is equal to \n    |x_1 - x_3| \n    \u00b7 (w_1 + w_3) =\n    |-2 - 1| \n    \u00b7 (2 + 1) = 9\n. For the second query, the minimum weighted\ndistance is between points \n    2\n and \n    3\n, which is equal to \n    |x_2 -\n    x_3| \n    \u00b7 (w_2 + w_3) = |0 - 1| \n    \u00b7 (10 + 1) = 11\n. For the fourth\nquery, the minimum weighted distance is between points \n    3\n and \n    4\n,\nwhich is equal to \n    |x_3 - x_4| \n    \u00b7 (w_3 + w_4) = |1 - 9| \n    \u00b7 (1 + 2)\n    = 24\n.\n\n",
