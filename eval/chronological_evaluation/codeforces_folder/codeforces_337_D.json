        "description": "Paladin Manao caught the trail of the ancient Book of Evil in a swampy area.\nThis area contains n settlements numbered from 1 to n. Moving through the\nswamp is very difficult, so people tramped exactly n - 1 paths. Each of these\npaths connects some pair of settlements and is bidirectional. Moreover, it is\npossible to reach any settlement from any other one by traversing one or\nseveral paths. The distance between two settlements is the minimum number of\npaths that have to be crossed to get from one settlement to the other one.\nManao knows that the Book of Evil has got a damage range d. This means that if\nthe Book of Evil is located in some settlement, its damage (for example,\nemergence of ghosts and werewolves) affects other settlements at distance d or\nless from the settlement where the Book resides. Manao has heard of m\nsettlements affected by the Book of Evil. Their numbers are p1, p2, ..., pm.\nNote that the Book may be affecting other settlements as well, but this has\nnot been detected yet. Manao wants to determine which settlements may contain\nthe Book. Help him with this difficult task. Input The first line contains\nthree space-separated integers n, m and d (1 \u2264 m \u2264 n \u2264 100000; 0 \u2264 d \u2264 n - 1).\nThe second line contains m distinct space-separated integers p1, p2, ..., pm\n(1 \u2264 pi \u2264 n). Then n - 1 lines follow, each line describes a path made in the\narea. A path is described by a pair of space-separated integers ai and bi\nrepresenting the ends of this path. Output Print a single number \u2014 the number\nof settlements that may contain the Book of Evil. It is possible that Manao\nreceived some controversial information and there is no settlement that may\ncontain the Book. In such case, print 0. Examples Input 6 2 3 1 2 1 5 2 3 3 4\n4 5 5 6 Output 3 Note Sample 1. The damage range of the Book of Evil equals 3\nand its effects have been noticed in settlements 1 and 2. Thus, it can be in\nsettlements 3, 4 or 5.\n\n",
