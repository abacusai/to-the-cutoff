        "description": "Sadly, the problem setter couldn't think of an interesting story, thus he just\nasks you to solve the following problem. Given an array \n    a\n consisting of\n\n    n\n positive integers, count the number of non-empty subsequences for\nwhich the bitwise \n    \ud835\udda0\ud835\uddad\ud835\udda3\n of the elements in the subsequence has\nexactly \n    k\n set bits in its binary representation. The answer may be\nlarge, so output it modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Recall that the subsequence of an\narray \n    a\n is a sequence that can be obtained from \n    a\n by removing some\n(possibly, zero) elements. For example, \n    [1, 2, 3]\n, \n    [3]\n, \n    [1,\n    3]\n are subsequences of \n    [1, 2, 3]\n, but \n    [3, 2]\n and \n    [4, 5,\n    6]\n are not. Note that \n    \ud835\udda0\ud835\uddad\ud835\udda3\n represents the bitwise AND\noperation. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). The\ndescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\nconsists of two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 6\n) \u2014 the length of the array and the number of\nset bits that the bitwise \n    \ud835\udda0\ud835\uddad\ud835\udda3\n the counted subsequences should\nhave in their binary representation. The second line of each test case\nconsists of \n    n\n integers \n    a_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 63\n) \u2014 the\narray \n    a\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, output a\nsingle integer \u2014 the number of subsequences that have exactly \n    k\n set bits\nin their bitwise \n    \ud835\udda0\ud835\uddad\ud835\udda3\n value's binary representation. The\nanswer may be large, so output it modulo \n    10^9+7\n.
