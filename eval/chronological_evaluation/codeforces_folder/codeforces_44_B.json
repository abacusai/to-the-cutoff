        "description": "To celebrate the opening of the Winter Computer School the organizers decided\nto buy in n liters of cola. However, an unexpected difficulty occurred in the\nshop: it turned out that cola is sold in bottles 0.5, 1 and 2 liters in\nvolume. At that, there are exactly a bottles 0.5 in volume, b one-liter\nbottles and c of two-liter ones. The organizers have enough money to buy any\namount of cola. What did cause the heated arguments was how many bottles of\nevery kind to buy, as this question is pivotal for the distribution of cola\namong the participants (and organizers as well). Thus, while the organizers\nare having the argument, discussing different variants of buying cola, the\nWinter School can't start. Your task is to count the number of all the\npossible ways to buy exactly n liters of cola and persuade the organizers that\nthis number is too large, and if they keep on arguing, then the Winter\nComputer School will have to be organized in summer. All the bottles of cola\nare considered indistinguishable, i.e. two variants of buying are different\nfrom each other only if they differ in the number of bottles of at least one\nkind. Input The first line contains four integers \u2014 n, a, b, c (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10000,\n0 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 5000). Output Print the unique number \u2014 the solution to the\nproblem. If it is impossible to buy exactly n liters of cola, print 0.\nExamples Input 10 5 5 5 Output 9 Input 3 0 0 2 Output 0\n\n",
