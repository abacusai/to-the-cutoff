        "description": "You're given a multiset of non-negative integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n. In one step you take two elements \n    x\n and \n    y\n of the\nmultiset, remove them and insert their mean value \n    x + y/2\n back\ninto the multiset. You repeat the step described above until you are left with\nonly two numbers \n    A\n and \n    B\n. What is the maximum possible value of\ntheir absolute difference \n    |A-B|\n? Since the answer is not an integer\nnumber, output it modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Input Each test contains multiple test\ncases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 100\n). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each\ntest case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the\nsize of the multiset. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the elements of the\nmultiset. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does\nnot exceed \n    10^6\n. Output For each test case, output a single integer, the\nanswer to the problem modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Formally, let \n    M = 10^9+7\n. It\ncan be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction\n\n    p/q\n, where \n    p\n and \n    q\n are integers and \n    q \n    \u2261 0 \n    M\n. Output the integer equal to \n    p \n    \u00b7 q^-1\n     M\n. In other words, output an integer \n    x\n such that \n    0 \n    \u2264 x\n    < M\n and \n    x \n    \u00b7 q \n    \u2261 p \n    M\n.

In the\nthird case, the exact answer is \n    3/2\n, and \n    500\n     000\n     005\n    \n    \u00b7 2 \n    \u2261 3 \n    10^9+7\n.\n\n",
