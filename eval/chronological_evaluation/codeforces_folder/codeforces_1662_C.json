        "description": "The map of Europe can be represented by a set of \n    n\n cities, numbered from\n\n    1\n through \n    n\n, which are connected by \n    m\n bidirectional roads,\neach of which connects two distinct cities. A trip of length \n    k\n is a\nsequence of \n    k+1\n cities \n    v_1, v_2, \n    \u2026, v_k+1\n such that there\nis a road connecting each consecutive pair \n    v_i\n, \n    v_i+1\n of cities,\nfor all \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 k\n. A special trip is a trip that does not use\nthe same road twice in a row, i.e., a sequence of \n    k+1\n cities \n    v_1,\n    v_2, \n    \u2026, v_k+1\n such that it forms a trip and \n    v_i \n    \u2260 v_i +\n    2\n, for all \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 k - 1\n. Given an integer \n    k\n, compute\nthe number of distinct special trips of length \n    k\n which begin and end in\nthe same city. Since the answer might be large, give the answer modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Input The first line contains three integers \n    n\n,\n\n    m\n and \n    k\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 n(n - 1) /\n    2\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of cities, the number of roads\nand the length of trips to consider. Each of the following \n    m\n lines\ncontains a pair of distinct integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b\n    \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 each pair represents a road connecting cities \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n. It is guaranteed that the roads are distinct (i.e., each pair of\ncities is connected by at most one road). Output Print the number of special\ntrips of length \n    k\n which begin and end in the same city, modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Examples Input 4 5 2 4 1 2 3 3 1 4 3 2 4 Output 0\nInput 4 5 3 1 3 4 2 4 1 2 1 3 4 Output 12 Input 8 20 12 4 3 6 7 5 7 8 2 8 3 3\n1 4 7 8 5 5 4 3 5 7 1 5 1 7 8 3 2 4 2 5 2 1 4 4 8 3 6 4 6 Output 35551130 Note\nIn the first sample, we are looking for special trips of length \n    2\n, but\nsince we cannot use the same road twice once we step away from a city we\ncannot go back, so the answer is \n    0\n. In the second sample, we have the\nfollowing \n    12\n special trips of length \n    3\n which begin and end in the\nsame city: \n    (1, 2, 4, 1)\n, \n    (1, 3, 4, 1)\n, \n    (1, 4, 2, 1)\n, \n    (1,\n    4, 3, 1)\n, \n    (2, 1, 4, 2)\n, \n    (2, 4, 1, 2)\n, \n    (3, 1, 4, 3)\n,\n\n    (3, 4, 1, 3)\n, \n    (4, 1, 3, 4)\n, \n    (4, 3, 1, 4)\n, \n    (4, 1, 2,\n    4)\n, and \n    (4, 2, 1, 4)\n.\n\n",
