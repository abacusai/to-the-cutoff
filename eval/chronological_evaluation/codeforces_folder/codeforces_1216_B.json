        "description": "Recently Vasya decided to improve his pistol shooting skills. Today his coach\noffered him the following exercise. He placed \n    n\n cans in a row on a\ntable. Cans are numbered from left to right from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Vasya has\nto knock down each can exactly once to finish the exercise. He is allowed to\nchoose the order in which he will knock the cans down. Vasya knows that the\ndurability of the \n    i\n-th can is \n    a_i\n. It means that if Vasya has\nalready knocked \n    x\n cans down and is now about to start shooting the\n\n    i\n-th one, he will need \n    (a_i \n    \u00b7 x + 1)\n shots to knock it down.\nYou can assume that if Vasya starts shooting the \n    i\n-th can, he will be\nshooting it until he knocks it down. Your task is to choose such an order of\nshooting so that the number of shots required to knock each of the \n    n\n\ngiven cans down exactly once is minimum possible. Input The first line of the\ninput contains one integer \n    n\n \n    (2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1\n     000)\n \u2014 the\nnumber of cans. The second line of the input contains the sequence \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 1\n     000)\n, where \n    a_i\n is\nthe durability of the \n    i\n-th can. Output In the first line print the\nminimum number of shots required to knock each of the \n    n\n given cans down\nexactly once. In the second line print the sequence consisting of \n    n\n\ndistinct integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n \u2014 the order of indices of cans that\nminimizes the number of shots required. If there are several answers, you can\nprint any of them. Examples Input 3 20 10 20 Output 43 1 3 2 Input 4 10 10 10\n10 Output 64 2 1 4 3 Input 6 5 4 5 4 4 5 Output 69 6 1 3 5 2 4 Input 2 1 4\nOutput 3 2 1 Note In the first example Vasya can start shooting from the first\ncan. He knocks it down with the first shot because he haven't knocked any\nother cans down before. After that he has to shoot the third can. To knock it\ndown he shoots \n    20 \n    \u00b7 1 + 1 = 21\n times. After that only second can\nremains. To knock it down Vasya shoots \n    10 \n    \u00b7 2 + 1 = 21\n times. So\nthe total number of shots is \n    1 + 21 + 21 = 43\n. In the second example the\norder of shooting does not matter because all cans have the same durability.\n\n",
