        "description": "Let's denote the Manhattan distance between two points \n    p_1\n (with\ncoordinates \n    (x_1, y_1)\n) and \n    p_2\n (with coordinates \n    (x_2,\n    y_2)\n) as \n    d(p_1, p_2) = |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\n. For example, the\ndistance between two points with coordinates \n    (1, 3)\n and \n    (4, 2)\n is\n\n    |1 - 4| + |3 - 2| = 4\n. You are given two points, \n    A\n and \n    B\n.\nThe point \n    A\n has coordinates \n    (0, 0)\n, the point \n    B\n has\ncoordinates \n    (x, y)\n. Your goal is to find a point \n    C\n such that: both\ncoordinates of \n    C\n are non-negative integers; \n    d(A, C) = \n    d(A,\n    B)2\n (without any rounding); \n    d(B, C) = \n    d(A, B)2\n\n(without any rounding). Find any point \n    C\n that meets these constraints,\nor report that no such point exists. Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 3000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test\ncase consists of one line containing two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the coordinates of the point \n    B\n. Output For\neach test case, print the answer on a separate line as follows: if it is\nimpossible to find a point \n    C\n meeting the constraints, print \"-1 -1\"\n(without quotes); otherwise, print two non-negative integers not exceeding\n\n    10^6\n \u2014 the coordinates of point \n    C\n meeting the constraints. If\nthere are multiple answers, print any of them. It can be shown that if any\nsuch point exists, it's possible to find a point with coordinates not\nexceeding \n    10^6\n that meets the constraints.

If the point \n    C\n has coordinates \n    (23, 3)\n, then the distance\nfrom \n    A\n to \n    B\n is \n    |49 - 0| + |3 - 0| = 52\n, the distance from\n\n    A\n to \n    C\n is \n    |23 - 0| + |3 - 0| = 26\n, and the distance from\n\n    B\n to \n    C\n is \n    |23 - 49| + |3 - 3| = 26\n. In the second test case,\nthe point \n    B\n has coordinates \n    (2, 50)\n. If the point \n    C\n has\ncoordinates \n    (1, 25)\n, then the distance from \n    A\n to \n    B\n is \n    |2\n    - 0| + |50 - 0| = 52\n, the distance from \n    A\n to \n    C\n is \n    |1 - 0| +\n    |25 - 0| = 26\n, and the distance from \n    B\n to \n    C\n is \n    |1 - 2| + |25\n    - 50| = 26\n. In the third and the fourth test cases, it can be shown that no\npoint with integer coordinates meets the constraints. In the fifth test case,\nthe point \n    B\n has coordinates \n    (42, 0)\n. If the point \n    C\n has\ncoordinates \n    (21, 0)\n, then the distance from \n    A\n to \n    B\n is \n    |42\n    - 0| + |0 - 0| = 42\n, the distance from \n    A\n to \n    C\n is \n    |21 - 0| +\n    |0 - 0| = 21\n, and the distance from \n    B\n to \n    C\n is \n    |21 - 42| + |0\n    - 0| = 21\n.\n\n",
