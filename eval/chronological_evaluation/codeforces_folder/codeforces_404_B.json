        "description": "Valera takes part in the Berland Marathon. The marathon race starts at the\nstadium that can be represented on the plane as a square whose lower left\ncorner is located at point with coordinates (0, 0) and the length of the side\nequals a meters. The sides of the square are parallel to coordinate axes. As\nthe length of the marathon race is very long, Valera needs to have extra drink\nduring the race. The coach gives Valera a bottle of drink each d meters of the\npath. We know that Valera starts at the point with coordinates (0, 0) and runs\ncounter-clockwise. That is, when Valera covers a meters, he reaches the point\nwith coordinates (a, 0). We also know that the length of the marathon race\nequals nd + 0.5 meters. Help Valera's coach determine where he should be\nlocated to help Valera. Specifically, determine the coordinates of Valera's\npositions when he covers d, 2\u00b7d, ..., n\u00b7d meters. Input The first line\ncontains two space-separated real numbers a and d (1 \u2264 a, d \u2264 10^5), given\nwith precision till 4 decimal digits after the decimal point. Number a denotes\nthe length of the square's side that describes the stadium. Number d shows\nthat after each d meters Valera gets an extra drink. The second line contains\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) showing that Valera needs an extra drink n times.\nOutput Print n lines, each line should contain two real numbers xi and yi,\nseparated by a space. Numbers xi and yi in the i-th line mean that Valera is\nat point with coordinates (xi, yi) after he covers i\u00b7d meters. Your solution\nwill be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed\n10^-4. Note, that this problem have huge amount of output data. Please, do not\nuse cout stream for output in this problem.
