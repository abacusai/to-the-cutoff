        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n integers. You want to\ndistribute these \n    n\n integers into two groups \n    s_1\n and \n    s_2\n\n(groups can be empty) so that the following conditions are satisfied: For each\n\n    i\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n)\n, \n    a_i\n goes into exactly one group.\nThe value \n    |sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|\n is the maximum possible among all such\nways to distribute the integers.Here \n    sum(s_1)\n denotes the sum of the\nnumbers in the group \n    s_1\n, and \n    sum(s_2)\n denotes the sum of the\nnumbers in the group \n    s_2\n. Determine the maximum possible value of\n\n    |sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|\n. Input The input consists of multiple test\ncases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^4)\n \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test\ncases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer\n\n    n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5)\n \u2014 the length of the array \n    a\n. The\nsecond line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,a_2 \n    \u2026\n    a_n\n \n    (-10^9 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 elements of the array \n    a\n.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the\nmaximum possible value of \n    |sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|\n. Example Input 4 2 10\n-10 4 -2 -1 11 0 3 2 3 2 5 -9 2 0 0 -4 Output 0 8 7 11 Note In the first\ntestcase, we can distribute as \n    s_1 = \n    \n    10\n, \n    s_2 =\n    \n    \n    -10\n. Then the value will be \n    |10| - |-10| = 0\n. In the second\ntestcase, we can distribute as \n    s_1 = \n    \n    0, 11, -1\n, \n    s_2 =\n    \n    \n    -2\n. Then the value will be \n    |0 + 11 - 1| - |-2| = 10 - 2 =\n    8\n. In the third testcase, we can distribute as \n    s_1 = \n    \n    2, 3,\n    2\n, \n    s_2 =\n. Then the value will be \n    |2 + 3 + 2| - |0|\n    = 7\n. In the fourth testcase, we can distribute as \n    s_1 = \n    \n    -9, -4,\n    0\n, \n    s_2 = \n    \n    2, 0\n. Then the value will be \n    |-9 - 4 + 0|\n    - |2 + 0| = 13 - 2 = 11\n.\n\n",
