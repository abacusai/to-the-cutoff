        "description": "Twilight Sparkle was playing Ludo with her friends Rainbow Dash, Apple Jack\nand Flutter Shy. But she kept losing. Having returned to the castle, Twilight\nSparkle became interested in the dice that were used in the game. The dice has\nm faces: the first face of the dice contains a dot, the second one contains\ntwo dots, and so on, the m-th face contains m dots. Twilight Sparkle is sure\nthat when the dice is tossed, each face appears with probability . Also she\nknows that each toss is independent from others. Help her to calculate the\nexpected maximum number of dots she could get after tossing the dice n times.\nInput A single line contains two integers m and n (1 \u2264 m, n \u2264 10^5). Output\nOutput a single real number corresponding to the expected maximum. The answer\nwill be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10\n^-4. Examples Input 6 1 Output 3.500000000000 Input 6 3 Output 4.958333333333\nInput 2 2 Output 1.750000000000 Note Consider the third test example. If\nyou've made two tosses: You can get 1 in the first toss, and 2 in the second.\nMaximum equals to 2. You can get 1 in the first toss, and 1 in the second.\nMaximum equals to 1. You can get 2 in the first toss, and 1 in the second.\nMaximum equals to 2. You can get 2 in the first toss, and 2 in the second.\nMaximum equals to 2. The probability of each outcome is 0.25, that is\nexpectation equals to: You can read about expectation using the following\nlink: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\n\n",
