        "name": "Alternating Subsequence",
        "description": "Recall that the sequence \n    b\n is a a subsequence of the sequence \n    a\n if\n\n    b\n can be derived from \n    a\n by removing zero or more elements without\nchanging the order of the remaining elements. For example, if \n    a=[1, 2, 1,\n    3, 1, 2, 1]\n, then possible subsequences are: \n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n, \n    [3]\n\nand \n    [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]\n, but not \n    [3, 2, 3]\n and \n    [1, 1, 1, 1,\n    2]\n. You are given a sequence \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n positive and\nnegative elements (there is no zeros in the sequence). Your task is to choose\nmaximum by size (length) alternating subsequence of the given sequence (i.e.\nthe sign of each next element is the opposite from the sign of the current\nelement, like positive-negative-positive and so on or negative-positive-\nnegative and so on). Among all such subsequences, you have to choose one which\nhas the maximum sum of elements. In other words, if the maximum length of\nalternating subsequence is \n    k\n then your task is to find the maximum sum\nof elements of some alternating subsequence of length \n    k\n. You have to\nanswer \n    t\n independent test cases. Input The first line of the input\ncontains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of the test case\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of elements in \n    a\n. The second line of the test case contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9,\n    a_i \n     0\n), where \n    a_i\n is the \n    i\n-th element of \n    a\n. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n (\n    \u2211 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). Output For each test\ncase, print the answer \u2014 the maximum sum of the maximum by size (length)\nalternating subsequence of \n    a\n.
