        "description": "You are given four integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    x\n and \n    y\n. Initially,\n\n    a \n    \u2265 x\n and \n    b \n    \u2265 y\n. You can do the following operation no\nmore than \n    n\n times: Choose either \n    a\n or \n    b\n and decrease it by\none. However, as a result of this operation, value of \n    a\n cannot become\nless than \n    x\n, and value of \n    b\n cannot become less than \n    y\n. Your\ntask is to find the minimum possible product of \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    a\n    \n    \u00b7 b\n) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than\n\n    n\n times. You have to answer \n    t\n independent test cases. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow.\nThe only line of the test case contains five integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n,\n\n    x\n, \n    y\n and \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b, x, y, n \n    \u2264 10^9\n).\nAdditional constraint on the input: \n    a \n    \u2265 x\n and \n    b \n    \u2265 y\n always\nholds. Output For each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible\nproduct of \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    a \n    \u00b7 b\n) you can achieve by applying\nthe given operation no more than \n    n\n times.
