        "name": "Broken Keyboard",
        "description": "Recently, Mishka started noticing that his keyboard malfunctions \u2014 maybe it's\nbecause he was playing rhythm games too much. Empirically, Mishka has found\nout that every other time he presses a key, it is registered as if the key was\npressed twice. For example, if Mishka types text, the first time he presses a\nkey, exactly one letter is printed; the second time he presses a key, two same\nletters are printed; the third time he presses a key, one letter is printed;\nthe fourth time he presses a key, two same letters are printed, and so on.\nNote that the number of times a key was pressed is counted for the whole\nkeyboard, not for each key separately. For example, if Mishka tries to type\nthe word osu, it will be printed on the screen as ossu. You are given a word\nconsisting of \n    n\n lowercase Latin letters. You have to determine if it can\nbe printed on Mishka's keyboard or not. You may assume that Mishka cannot\ndelete letters from the word, and every time he presses a key, the new letter\n(or letters) is appended to the end of the word. Input The first line of the\ninput contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The first line of the test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the length of the word. The second line of the test\ncase contains a string \n    s\n consisting of \n    n\n lowercase Latin letters \u2014\nthe word that should be checked. Output For each test case, print YES if the\nword \n    s\n can be printed on Mishka's keyboard, and NO otherwise. Example\nInput 4 4 ossu 2 aa 6 addonn 3 qwe Output YES NO YES NO Note In the first test\ncase, Mishka can type the word as follows: press o (one letter o appears at\nthe end of the word), then presses s (two letters s appear at the end of the\nword), and, finally, press u (one letter appears at the end of the word,\nmaking the resulting word ossu). In the second test case, Mishka can try\ntyping the word as follows: press a (one letter a appears at the end of the\nword). But if he tries to press a one more time, two letters a will appear at\nthe end of the word, so it is impossible to print the word using his keyboard.\nIn the fourth test case, Mishka has to start by pressing q. Then, if he\npresses w, two copies of w will appear at the end of the word, but the third\nletter should be e instead of w, so the answer is NO.\n\n",
