        "description": "Last summer, Feluda gifted Lalmohan-Babu a balanced bracket sequence \n    s\n\nof length \n    2 n\n. Topshe was bored during his summer vacations, and hence\nhe decided to draw an undirected graph of \n    2 n\n vertices using the\nbalanced bracket sequence \n    s\n. For any two distinct vertices \n    i\n and\n\n    j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i < j \n    \u2264 2 n\n), Topshe draws an edge (undirected and\nunweighted) between these two nodes if and only if the subsegment \n    s[i\n    \n    \u2026 j]\n forms a balanced bracket sequence. Determine the number of\nconnected components in Topshe's graph. See the Notes section for definitions\nof the underlined terms. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first\nline of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of opening brackets in string \n    s\n. The second line\nof each test case contains a string \n    s\n of length \n    2 n\n \u2014 a balanced\nbracket sequence consisting of \n    n\n opening brackets \"(\", and \n    n\n\nclosing brackets \")\". It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output a single\ninteger \u2014 the number of connected components in Topshe's graph. Example Input\n4 1 () 3 ()(()) 3 ((())) 4 (())(()) Output 1 2 3 3 Note Sample explanation: In\nthe first test case, the graph constructed from the bracket sequence (), is\njust a graph containing nodes \n    1\n and \n    2\n connected by a single edge.\nIn the second test case, the graph constructed from the bracket sequence\n()(()) would be the following (containing two connected components):\nDefinition of Underlined Terms: A sequence of brackets is called balanced if\none can turn it into a valid math expression by adding characters \n    +\n and\n\n    1\n. For example, sequences (())(), (), and (()(())) are balanced, while\n)(, ((), and (()))( are not. The subsegment \n    s[l \n    \u2026 r]\n denotes the\nsequence \n    [s_l, s_l + 1, \n    \u2026, s_r]\n. A connected component is a set\nof vertices \n    X\n such that for every two vertices from this set there\nexists at least one path in the graph connecting these vertices, but adding\nany other vertex to \n    X\n violates this rule.\n\n",
