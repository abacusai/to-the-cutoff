        "description": "You have a sequence \n    a\n with \n    n\n elements \n    1, 2, 3, \n    \u2026, k - 1,\n    k, k - 1, k - 2, \n    \u2026, k - (n - k)\n (\n    k \n    \u2264 n < 2k\n). Let's call as\ninversion in \n    a\n a pair of indices \n    i < j\n such that \n    a[i] >\n    a[j]\n. Suppose, you have some permutation \n    p\n of size \n    k\n and you\nbuild a sequence \n    b\n of size \n    n\n in the following manner: \n    b[i] =\n    p[a[i]]\n. Your goal is to find such permutation \n    p\n that the total\nnumber of inversions in \n    b\n doesn't exceed the total number of inversions\nin \n    a\n, and \n    b\n is lexicographically maximum. Small reminder: the\nsequence of \n    k\n integers is called a permutation if it contains all\nintegers from \n    1\n to \n    k\n exactly once. Another small reminder: a\nsequence \n    s\n is lexicographically smaller than another sequence \n    t\n,\nif either \n    s\n is a prefix of \n    t\n, or for the first \n    i\n such that\n\n    s_i \n     t_i\n, \n    s_i < t_i\n holds (in the first position that these\nsequences are different, \n    s\n has smaller number than \n    t\n). Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. The first and only line of each test case contains\ntwo integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    k \n    \u2264 n < 2k\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the sequence \n    a\n and its maximum. It's guaranteed\nthat the total sum of \n    k\n over test cases doesn't exceed \n    10^5\n.\nOutput For each test case, print \n    k\n integers \u2014 the permutation \n    p\n\nwhich maximizes \n    b\n lexicographically without increasing the total number\nof inversions. It can be proven that \n    p\n exists and is unique. Example\nInput 4 1 1 2 2 3 2 4 3 Output 1 1 2 2 1 1 3 2 Note In the first test case,\nthe sequence \n    a = [1]\n, there is only one permutation \n    p = [1]\n. In\nthe second test case, the sequence \n    a = [1, 2]\n. There is no inversion in\n\n    a\n, so there is only one permutation \n    p = [1, 2]\n which doesn't\nincrease the number of inversions. In the third test case, \n    a = [1, 2, 1]\n\nand has \n    1\n inversion. If we use \n    p = [2, 1]\n, then \n    b = [p[a[1]],\n    p[a[2]], p[a[3]]] = [2, 1, 2]\n and also has \n    1\n inversion. In the fourth\ntest case, \n    a = [1, 2, 3, 2]\n, and since \n    p = [1, 3, 2]\n then \n    b =\n    [1, 3, 2, 3]\n. Both \n    a\n and \n    b\n have \n    1\n inversion and \n    b\n\nis the lexicographically maximum.\n\n",
