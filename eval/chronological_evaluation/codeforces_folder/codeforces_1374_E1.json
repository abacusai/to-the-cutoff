        "name": "Reading Books (easy version)",
        "description": "Easy and hard versions are actually different problems, so read statements of\nboth problems completely and carefully. Summer vacation has started so Alice\nand Bob want to play and joy, but... Their mom doesn't think so. She says that\nthey have to read some amount of books before all entertainments. Alice and\nBob will read each book together to end this exercise faster. There are\n\n    n\n books in the family library. The \n    i\n-th book is described by three\nintegers: \n    t_i\n \u2014 the amount of time Alice and Bob need to spend to read\nit, \n    a_i\n (equals \n    1\n if Alice likes the \n    i\n-th book and \n    0\n\nif not), and \n    b_i\n (equals \n    1\n if Bob likes the \n    i\n-th book and\n\n    0\n if not). So they need to choose some books from the given \n    n\n\nbooks in such a way that: Alice likes at least \n    k\n books from the chosen\nset and Bob likes at least \n    k\n books from the chosen set; the total\nreading time of these books is minimized (they are children and want to play\nand joy as soon a possible). The set they choose is the same for both Alice an\nBob (it's shared between them) and they read all books together, so the total\nreading time is the sum of \n    t_i\n over all books that are in the chosen\nset. Your task is to help them and find any suitable set of books or determine\nthat it is impossible to find such a set. Input The first line of the input\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The next \n    n\n lines contain descriptions of books, one\ndescription per line: the \n    i\n-th line contains three integers \n    t_i\n,\n\n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t_i \n    \u2264 10^4\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i\n    \n    \u2264 1\n), where: \n    t_i\n \u2014 the amount of time required for reading the\n\n    i\n-th book; \n    a_i\n equals \n    1\n if Alice likes the \n    i\n-th book\nand \n    0\n otherwise; \n    b_i\n equals \n    1\n if Bob likes the \n    i\n-th\nbook and \n    0\n otherwise. Output If there is no solution, print only one\ninteger -1. Otherwise print one integer \n    T\n \u2014 the minimum total reading\ntime of the suitable set of books.
