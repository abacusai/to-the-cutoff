        "description": "Alice has a very important message M consisting of some non-negative integers\nthat she wants to keep secret from Eve. Alice knows that the only\ntheoretically secure cipher is one-time pad. Alice generates a random key K of\nthe length equal to the message's length. Alice computes the bitwise xor of\neach element of the message and the key (, where denotes the bitwise XOR\noperation) and stores this encrypted message A. Alice is smart. Be like Alice.\nFor example, Alice may have wanted to store a message M = (0, 15, 9, 18). She\ngenerated a key K = (16, 7, 6, 3). The encrypted message is thus A = (16, 8,\n15, 17). Alice realised that she cannot store the key with the encrypted\nmessage. Alice sent her key K to Bob and deleted her own copy. Alice is smart.\nReally, be like Alice. Bob realised that the encrypted message is only secure\nas long as the key is secret. Bob thus randomly permuted the key before\nstoring it. Bob thinks that this way, even if Eve gets both the encrypted\nmessage and the key, she will not be able to read the message. Bob is not\nsmart. Don't be like Bob. In the above example, Bob may have, for instance,\nselected a permutation (3, 4, 1, 2) and stored the permuted key P = (6, 3, 16,\n7). One year has passed and Alice wants to decrypt her message. Only now Bob\nhas realised that this is impossible. As he has permuted the key randomly, the\nmessage is lost forever. Did we mention that Bob isn't smart? Bob wants to\nsalvage at least some information from the message. Since he is not so smart,\nhe asks for your help. You know the encrypted message A and the permuted key\nP. What is the lexicographically smallest message that could have resulted in\nthe given encrypted text? More precisely, for given A and P, find the\nlexicographically smallest message O, for which there exists a permutation \u03c0\nsuch that for every i. Note that the sequence S is lexicographically smaller\nthan the sequence T, if there is an index i such that Si < Ti and for all j <\ni the condition Sj = Tj holds. Input The first line contains a single integer\nN (1 \u2264 N \u2264 300000), the length of the message. The second line contains N\nintegers A1, A2, ..., AN (0 \u2264 Ai < 2^30) representing the encrypted message.\nThe third line contains N integers P1, P2, ..., PN (0 \u2264 Pi < 2^30)\nrepresenting the permuted encryption key. Output Output a single line with N\nintegers, the lexicographically smallest possible message O. Note that all its\nelements should be non-negative. Examples Input 3 8 4 13 17 2 7 Output 10 3 28\nInput 5 12 7 87 22 11 18 39 9 12 16 Output 0 14 69 6 44 Input 10 331415699\n278745619 998190004 423175621 42983144 166555524 843586353 802130100 337889448\n685310951 226011312 266003835 342809544 504667531 529814910 684873393\n817026985 844010788 993949858 1031395667 Output 128965467 243912600 4281110\n112029883 223689619 76924724 429589 119397893 613490433 362863284 Note In the\nfirst case, the solution is (10, 3, 28), since , and . Other possible\npermutations of key yield messages (25, 6, 10), (25, 3, 15), (10, 21, 10),\n(15, 21, 15) and (15, 6, 28), which are all lexicographically larger than the\nsolution.\n\n",
