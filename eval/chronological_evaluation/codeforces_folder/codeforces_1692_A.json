The value \n    a\n is the\ndistance that Timur has run and \n    b\n, \n    c\n, \n    d\n correspond to the\ndistances the other three participants ran. Output the number of participants\nin front of Timur. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\neach test case consists of four distinct integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    c\n,\n\n    d\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a, b, c, d \n    \u2264 10^4\n). Output For each test case,\noutput a single integer \u2014 the number of participants in front of Timur.\nExample Input 4 2 3 4 1 10000 0 1 2 500 600 400 300 0 9999 10000 9998 Output 2\n0 1 3 Note For the first test case, there are \n    2\n people in front of\nTimur, specifically the participants who ran distances of \n    3\n and \n    4\n.\nThe other participant is not in front of Timur because he ran a shorter\ndistance than Timur. For the second test case, no one is in front of Timur,\nsince he ran a distance of \n    10000\n while all others ran a distance of\n\n    0\n, \n    1\n, and \n    2\n respectively. For the third test case, only the\nsecond person is in front of Timur, who ran a total distance of \n    600\n\nwhile Timur ran a distance of \n    500\n.\n\n",
