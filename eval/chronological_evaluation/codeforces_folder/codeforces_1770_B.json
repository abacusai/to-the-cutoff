        "description": "Reve has two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n. Let \n    p\n be a\npermutation\n    ^\n    \u2020\n of length \n    n\n. Let \n    c\n be an array of\nlength \n    n - k + 1\n such that \n    \n\n    c_i = \n    max(p_i, \n    \u2026, p_i+k-1) +\n    \n    min(p_i, \n    \u2026, p_i+k-1).\n\n    \n Let the cost of the permutation \n    p\n\nbe the maximum element of \n    c\n. Koxia wants you to construct a permutation\nwith the minimum possible cost. \n    ^\n    \u2020\n A permutation of length\n\n    n\n is an array consisting of \n    n\n distinct integers from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n in arbitrary order. For example, \n    [2,3,1,5,4]\n is a permutation,\nbut \n    [1,2,2]\n is not a permutation (\n    2\n appears twice in the array),\nand \n    [1,3,4]\n is also not a permutation (\n    n=3\n but there is \n    4\n in\nthe array). Input Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2000\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each\ntest case contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case,\noutput \n    n\n integers \n    p_1,p_2,\n    \u2026,p_n\n, which is a permutation with\nminimal cost. If there is more than one permutation with minimal cost, you may\noutput any of them. Example Input 3 5 3 5 1 6 6 Output 5 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 3 2\n4 1 6 5 Note In the first test case, \n    c_1 = \n    max(p_1,p_2,p_3) +\n    \n    min(p_1,p_2,p_3) = 5 + 1 = 6\n. \n    c_2 = \n    max(p_2,p_3,p_4) +\n    \n    min(p_2,p_3,p_4) = 3 + 1 = 4\n. \n    c_3 = \n    max(p_3,p_4,p_5) +\n    \n    min(p_3,p_4,p_5) = 4 + 2 = 6\n. Therefore, the cost is\n\n    max(6,4,6)=6\n. It can be proven that this is the minimal cost.\n\n",
