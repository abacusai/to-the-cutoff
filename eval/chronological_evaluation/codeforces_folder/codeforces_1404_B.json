        "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a fun game of tree tag. The game is played on a tree\nof \n    n\n vertices numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Recall that a tree on\n\n    n\n vertices is an undirected, connected graph with \n    n-1\n edges.\nInitially, Alice is located at vertex \n    a\n, and Bob at vertex \n    b\n. They\ntake turns alternately, and Alice makes the first move. In a move, Alice can\njump to a vertex with distance at most \n    da\n from the current vertex. And\nin a move, Bob can jump to a vertex with distance at most \n    db\n from the\ncurrent vertex. The distance between two vertices is defined as the number of\nedges on the unique simple path between them. In particular, either player is\nallowed to stay at the same vertex in a move. Note that when performing a\nmove, a player only occupies the starting and ending vertices of their move,\nnot the vertices between them. If after at most \n    10^100\n moves, Alice\nand Bob occupy the same vertex, then Alice is declared the winner. Otherwise,\nBob wins. Determine the winner if both players play optimally. Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains five integers \n    n,a,b,da,db\n\n(\n    2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 a,b\n    \u2264 n\n, \n    a\n     b\n, \n    1\n    \u2264\n    da,db\n    \u2264 n-1\n) \u2014 the number of vertices, Alice's vertex, Bob's vertex,\nAlice's maximum jumping distance, and Bob's maximum jumping distance,\nrespectively. The following \n    n-1\n lines describe the edges of the tree.\nThe \n    i\n-th of these lines contains two integers \n    u\n, \n    v\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 u, v\n    \u2264 n, u\n     v\n), denoting an edge between vertices\n\n    u\n and \n    v\n. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree structure.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n across all test cases does not exceed\n\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output a single line containing the\nwinner of the game: \"Alice\" or \"Bob\".

Then\nwherever Bob moves next, Alice will be able to move to the same vertex on the\nnext move. In the second test case, Bob has the following strategy to win.\nWherever Alice moves, Bob will always move to whichever of the two vertices\n\n    1\n or \n    6\n is farthest from Alice.\n\n",
