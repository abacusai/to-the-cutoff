        "description": "One day in the IT lesson Anna and Maria learned about the lexicographic order.\nString x is lexicographically less than string y, if either x is a prefix of y\n(and x \u2260 y), or there exists such i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 min(|x|, |y|)), that xi < yi, and\nfor any j (1 \u2264 j < i) xj = yj. Here |a| denotes the length of the string a.\nThe lexicographic comparison of strings is implemented by operator < in modern\nprogramming languages\u200b\u200b. The teacher gave Anna and Maria homework. She gave\nthem a string of length n. They should write out all substrings of the given\nstring, including the whole initial string, and the equal substrings (for\nexample, one should write out the following substrings from the string \"aab\":\n\"a\", \"a\", \"aa\", \"ab\", \"aab\", \"b\"). The resulting strings should be sorted in\nthe lexicographical order. The cunning teacher doesn't want to check all these\nstrings. That's why she said to find only the k-th string from the list. Help\nAnna and Maria do the homework. Input The first line contains a non-empty\nstring that only consists of small Latin letters (\"a\"-\"z\"), whose length does\nnot exceed 10^5. The second line contains the only integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5).\nOutput Print the string Anna and Maria need \u2014 the k-th (in the lexicographical\norder) substring of the given string. If the total number of substrings is\nless than k, print a string saying \"No such line.\" (without the quotes).\nExamples Input aa 2 Output a Input abc 5 Output bc Input abab 7 Output b Note\nIn the second sample before string \"bc\" follow strings \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\", \"b\".\n\n",
