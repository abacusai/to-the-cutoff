        "description": "One day Prof. Slim decided to leave the kingdom of the GUC to join the kingdom\nof the GIU. He was given an easy online assessment to solve before joining the\nGIU. Citizens of the GUC were happy sad to see the prof leaving, so they\ndecided to hack into the system and change the online assessment into a harder\none so that he stays at the GUC. After a long argument, they decided to change\nit into the following problem. Given an array of \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n, where \n    a_i\n    \u2260 0\n, check if you can make\nthis array sorted by using the following operation any number of times\n(possibly zero). An array is sorted if its elements are arranged in a non-\ndecreasing order. select two indices \n    i\n and \n    j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i,j \n    \u2264\n    n\n) such that \n    a_i\n and \n    a_j\n have different signs. In other words,\none must be positive and one must be negative. swap the signs of \n    a_i\n\nand \n    a_j\n. For example if you select \n    a_i=3\n and \n    a_j=-2\n, then\nthey will change to \n    a_i=-3\n and \n    a_j=2\n. Prof. Slim saw that the\nproblem is still too easy and isn't worth his time, so he decided to give it\nto you to solve. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases\nfollow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the array \n    a\n. The next\nline contain \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264\n    a_i\n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    a_i\n    \u2260 0\n) separated by spaces describing\nelements of the array \n    a\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over\nall test cases doesn't exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print\n\"YES\" if the array can be sorted in the non-decreasing order, otherwise print\n\"NO\". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). Example Input 4\n7 7 3 2 -11 -13 -17 -23 6 4 10 25 47 71 96 6 71 -35 7 -4 -11 -25 6 -45 9 -48\n-67 -55 7 Output NO YES YES NO Note In the first test case, there is no way to\nmake the array sorted using the operation any number of times. In the second\ntest case, the array is already sorted. In the third test case, we can swap\nthe sign of the \n    1\n-st element with the sign of the \n    5\n-th element,\nand the sign of the \n    3\n-rd element with the sign of the \n    6\n-th\nelement, this way the array will be sorted. In the fourth test case, there is\nno way to make the array sorted using the operation any number of times.\n\n",
