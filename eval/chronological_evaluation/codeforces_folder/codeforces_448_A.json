Besides, he has b1 first prize medals, b2 second\nprize medals and b3 third prize medals. Naturally, the rewards in the cupboard\nmust look good, that's why Bizon the Champion decided to follow the rules: any\nshelf cannot contain both cups and medals at the same time; no shelf can\ncontain more than five cups; no shelf can have more than ten medals. Help\nBizon the Champion find out if we can put all the rewards so that all the\nconditions are fulfilled. Input The first line contains integers a1, a2 and a3\n(0 \u2264 a1, a2, a3 \u2264 100). The second line contains integers b1, b2 and b3 (0 \u2264\nb1, b2, b3 \u2264 100). The third line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). The\nnumbers in the lines are separated by single spaces. Output Print \"YES\"\n(without the quotes) if all the rewards can be put on the shelves in the\ndescribed manner. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes). Examples Input 1\n1 1 1 1 1 4 Output YES Input 1 1 3 2 3 4 2 Output YES Input 1 0 0 1 0 0 1\nOutput NO\n\n",
