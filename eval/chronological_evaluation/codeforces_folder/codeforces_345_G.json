The\nfollowing two conditions must hold: there exists a string t such, that each\nstring from found subgroup is its suffix; the number of strings in the found\nsubgroup is as large as possible. Your task is to print the number of strings\nin the found subgroup. Input The first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n10^5) \u2014 the number of strings in the group. Each of the next n lines contains\na string. The i-th line contains non-empty string si. Each string consists\nonly from lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all strings si doesn't exceed\n10^5. Output Output a single integer \u2014 the number of strings in the found\nsubgroup. Examples Input 6 bb bb b aaa aa z Output 3 Note Look at the test\nsample. The required subgroup is s1, s2, s3.\n\n",
