        "description": "Alex enjoys performing magic tricks. He has a trick that requires a deck of n\ncards. He has m identical decks of n different cards each, which have been\nmixed together. When Alex wishes to perform the trick, he grabs n cards at\nrandom and performs the trick with those. The resulting deck looks like a\nnormal deck, but may have duplicates of some cards. The trick itself is\nperformed as follows: first Alex allows you to choose a random card from the\ndeck. You memorize the card and put it back in the deck. Then Alex shuffles\nthe deck, and pulls out a card. If the card matches the one you memorized, the\ntrick is successful. You don't think Alex is a very good magician, and that he\njust pulls a card randomly from the deck. Determine the probability of the\ntrick being successful if this is the case. Input First line of the input\nconsists of two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000), separated by space \u2014\nnumber of cards in each deck, and number of decks. Output On the only line of\nthe output print one floating point number \u2013 probability of Alex successfully\nperforming the trick. Relative or absolute error of your answer should not be\nhigher than 10^-6. Examples Input 2 2 Output 0.6666666666666666 Input 4 4\nOutput 0.4000000000000000 Input 1 2 Output 1.0000000000000000 Note In the\nfirst sample, with probability Alex will perform the trick with two cards with\nthe same value from two different decks. In this case the trick is guaranteed\nto succeed. With the remaining probability he took two different cards, and\nthe probability of pulling off the trick is . The resulting probability is\n\n",
