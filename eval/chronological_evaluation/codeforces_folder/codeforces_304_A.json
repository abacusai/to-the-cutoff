        "description": "In mathematics, the Pythagorean theorem \u2014 is a relation in Euclidean geometry\namong the three sides of a right-angled triangle. In terms of areas, it\nstates: \u007fIn any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is\nthe hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the\nareas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at\na right angle). The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths\nof the sides a, b and c, often called the Pythagorean equation: a^2 + b^2 =\nc^2 where c represents the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b represent the\nlengths of the other two sides. Given n, your task is to count how many right-\nangled triangles with side-lengths a, b and c that satisfied an inequality 1 \u2264\na \u2264 b \u2264 c \u2264 n. Input The only line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^4) as we\nmentioned above. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the answer to the problem.\nExamples Input 5 Output 1 Input 74 Output 35\n\n",
