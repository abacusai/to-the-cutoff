        "description": "Yakko, Wakko and Dot, world-famous animaniacs, decided to rest from acting in\ncartoons, and take a leave to travel a bit. Yakko dreamt to go to\nPennsylvania, his Motherland and the Motherland of his ancestors. Wakko\nthought about Tasmania, its beaches, sun and sea. Dot chose Transylvania as\nthe most mysterious and unpredictable place. But to their great regret, the\nleave turned to be very short, so it will be enough to visit one of the three\nabove named places. That's why Yakko, as the cleverest, came up with a truly\ngenius idea: let each of the three roll an ordinary six-sided die, and the one\nwith the highest amount of points will be the winner, and will take the other\ntwo to the place of his/her dreams. Yakko thrown a die and got Y points, Wakko\n\u2014 W points. It was Dot's turn. But she didn't hurry. Dot wanted to know for\nsure what were her chances to visit Transylvania. It is known that Yakko and\nWakko are true gentlemen, that's why if they have the same amount of points\nwith Dot, they will let Dot win. Input The only line of the input file\ncontains two natural numbers Y and W \u2014 the results of Yakko's and Wakko's die\nrolls. Output Output the required probability in the form of irreducible\nfraction in format \u00abA/B\u00bb, where A \u2014 the numerator, and B \u2014 the denominator. If\nthe required probability equals to zero, output \u00ab0/1\u00bb. If the required\nprobability equals to 1, output \u00ab1/1\u00bb. Examples Input 4 2 Output 1/2 Note Dot\nwill go to Transylvania, if she is lucky to roll 4, 5 or 6 points.\n\n",
