        "description": "Little Vlad is fond of popular computer game Bota-2. Recently, the developers\nannounced the new add-on named Bota-3. Of course, Vlad immediately bought only\nto find out his computer is too old for the new game and needs to be updated.\nThere are n video cards in the shop, the power of the i-th video card is equal\nto integer value ai. As Vlad wants to be sure the new game will work he wants\nto buy not one, but several video cards and unite their powers using the\ncutting-edge technology. To use this technology one of the cards is chosen as\nthe leading one and other video cards are attached to it as secondary. For\nthis new technology to work it's required that the power of each of the\nsecondary video cards is divisible by the power of the leading video card. In\norder to achieve that the power of any secondary video card can be reduced to\nany integer value less or equal than the current power. However, the power of\nthe leading video card should remain unchanged, i.e. it can't be reduced. Vlad\nhas an infinite amount of money so he can buy any set of video cards. Help him\ndetermine which video cards he should buy such that after picking the leading\nvideo card and may be reducing some powers of others to make them work\ntogether he will get the maximum total value of video power. Input The first\nline of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number\nof video cards in the shop. The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ...,\nan (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 200 000) \u2014 powers of video cards. Output The only line of the\noutput should contain one integer value \u2014 the maximum possible total power of\nvideo cards working together. Examples Input 4 3 2 15 9 Output 27 Input 4 8 2\n2 7 Output 18 Note In the first sample, it would be optimal to buy video cards\nwith powers 3, 15 and 9. The video card with power 3 should be chosen as the\nleading one and all other video cards will be compatible with it. Thus, the\ntotal power would be 3 + 15 + 9 = 27. If he buys all the video cards and pick\nthe one with the power 2 as the leading, the powers of all other video cards\nshould be reduced by 1, thus the total power would be 2 + 2 + 14 + 8 = 26,\nthat is less than 27. Please note, that it's not allowed to reduce the power\nof the leading video card, i.e. one can't get the total power 3 + 1 + 15 + 9 =\n28. In the second sample, the optimal answer is to buy all video cards and\npick the one with the power 2 as the leading. The video card with the power 7\nneeds it power to be reduced down to 6. The total power would be 8 + 2 + 2 + 6\n= 18.\n\n",
