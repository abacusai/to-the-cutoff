        "description": "You've got a robot, its task is destroying bombs on a square plane.\nSpecifically, the square plane contains n bombs, the i-th bomb is at point\nwith coordinates (xi, yi). We know that no two bombs are at the same point and\nthat no bomb is at point with coordinates (0, 0). Initially, the robot is at\npoint with coordinates (0, 0). Also, let's mark the robot's current position\nas (x, y). In order to destroy all the bombs, the robot can perform three\ntypes of operations: Operation has format \"1 k dir\". To perform the operation\nrobot have to move in direction dir k (k \u2265 1) times. There are only 4\ndirections the robot can move in: \"R\", \"L\", \"U\", \"D\". During one move the\nrobot can move from the current point to one of following points: (x + 1, y),\n(x - 1, y), (x, y + 1), (x, y - 1) (corresponding to directions). It is\nforbidden to move from point (x, y), if at least one point on the path\n(besides the destination point) contains a bomb. Operation has format \"2\". To\nperform the operation robot have to pick a bomb at point (x, y) and put it in\na special container. Thus, the robot can carry the bomb from any point to any\nother point. The operation cannot be performed if point (x, y) has no bomb. It\nis forbidden to pick a bomb if the robot already has a bomb in its container.\nOperation has format \"3\". To perform the operation robot have to take a bomb\nout of the container and destroy it. You are allowed to perform this operation\nonly if the robot is at point (0, 0). It is forbidden to perform the operation\nif the container has no bomb. Help the robot and find the shortest possible\nsequence of operations he can perform to destroy all bombs on the coordinate\nplane. Input The first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the\nnumber of bombs on the coordinate plane. Next n lines contain two integers\neach. The i-th line contains numbers (xi, yi) ( - 10^9 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the\ncoordinates of the i-th bomb. It is guaranteed that no two bombs are located\nat the same point and no bomb is at point (0, 0). Output In a single line\nprint a single integer k \u2014 the minimum number of operations needed to destroy\nall bombs. On the next lines print the descriptions of these k operations. If\nthere are multiple sequences, you can print any of them. It is guaranteed that\nthere is the solution where k \u2264 10^6. Examples Input 2 1 1 -1 -1 Output 12 1 1\nR 1 1 U 2 1 1 L 1 1 D 3 1 1 L 1 1 D 2 1 1 R 1 1 U 3 Input 3 5 0 0 5 1 0 Output\n12 1 1 R 2 1 1 L 3 1 5 R 2 1 5 L 3 1 5 U 2 1 5 D 3\n\n",
