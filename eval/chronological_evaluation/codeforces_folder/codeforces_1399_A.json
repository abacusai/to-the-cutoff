        "description": "You are given the array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n positive (greater than\nzero) integers. In one move, you can choose two indices \n    i\n and \n    j\n\n(\n    i \n     j\n) such that the absolute difference between \n    a_i\n and\n\n    a_j\n is no more than one (\n    |a_i - a_j| \n    \u2264 1\n) and remove the\nsmallest of these two elements. If two elements are equal, you can remove any\nof them (but exactly one). Your task is to find if it is possible to obtain\nthe array consisting of only one element using several (possibly, zero) such\nmoves or not. You have to answer \n    t\n independent test cases. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The first\nline of the test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n)\n\u2014 the length of \n    a\n. The second line of the test case contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 100\n), where\n\n    a_i\n is the \n    i\n-th element of \n    a\n. Output For each test case,\nprint the answer: \"YES\" if it is possible to obtain the array consisting of\nonly one element using several (possibly, zero) moves described in the problem\nstatement, or \"NO\" otherwise. Example Input 5 3 1 2 2 4 5 5 5 5 3 1 2 4 4 1 3\n4 4 1 100 Output YES YES NO NO YES Note In the first test case of the example,\nwe can perform the following sequence of moves: choose \n    i=1\n and \n    j=3\n\nand remove \n    a_i\n (so \n    a\n becomes \n    [2; 2]\n); choose \n    i=1\n and\n\n    j=2\n and remove \n    a_j\n (so \n    a\n becomes \n    [2]\n). In the second\ntest case of the example, we can choose any possible \n    i\n and \n    j\n any\nmove and it doesn't matter which element we remove. In the third test case of\nthe example, there is no way to get rid of \n    2\n and \n    4\n.\n\n",
