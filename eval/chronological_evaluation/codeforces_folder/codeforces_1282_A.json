        "description": "Polycarp lives on the coordinate axis \n    Ox\n and travels from the point\n\n    x=a\n to \n    x=b\n. It moves uniformly rectilinearly at a speed of one\nunit of distance per minute. On the axis \n    Ox\n at the point \n    x=c\n the\nbase station of the mobile operator is placed. It is known that the radius of\nits coverage is \n    r\n. Thus, if Polycarp is at a distance less than or equal\nto \n    r\n from the point \n    x=c\n, then he is in the network coverage area,\notherwise \u2014 no. The base station can be located both on the route of Polycarp\nand outside it. Print the time in minutes during which Polycarp will not be in\nthe coverage area of the network, with a rectilinear uniform movement from\n\n    x=a\n to \n    x=b\n. His speed \u2014 one unit of distance per minute. Input The\nfirst line contains a positive integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. In the following lines are written \n    t\n test\ncases. The description of each test case is one line, which contains four\nintegers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    c\n and \n    r\n (\n    -10^8 \n    \u2264 a,b,c \n    \u2264\n    10^8\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 10^8\n) \u2014 the coordinates of the starting and\nending points of the path, the base station, and its coverage radius,\nrespectively. Any of the numbers \n    a\n, \n    b\n and \n    c\n can be equal\n(either any pair or all three numbers). The base station can be located both\non the route of Polycarp and outside it. Output Print \n    t\n numbers \u2014\nanswers to given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each\nanswer is an integer \u2014 the number of minutes during which Polycarp will be\nunavailable during his movement.

Polycarp goes\nfrom \n    1\n to \n    10\n. The yellow area shows the coverage area of the\nstation with a radius of coverage of \n    1\n, which is located at the point of\n\n    7\n. The green area shows a part of the path when Polycarp is out of\ncoverage area.\n\n",
