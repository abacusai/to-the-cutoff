        "description": "The universe is a coordinate plane. There are \n    n\n space highways, each of\nwhich is a straight line \n    y=kx\n passing through the origin \n    (0, 0)\n.\nAlso, there are \n    m\n asteroid belts on the plane, which we represent as\nopen upwards parabolas, i. e. graphs of functions \n    y=ax^2+bx+c\n, where\n\n    a > 0\n. You want to photograph each parabola. To do this, for each\nparabola you need to choose a line that does not intersect this parabola and\ndoes not touch it. You can select the same line for different parabolas.\nPlease find such a line for each parabola, or determine that there is no such\nline. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains\nthe number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). The description\nof the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains \n    2\n\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014the number of\nlines and parabolas, respectively. Each of the next \n    n\n lines contains one\ninteger \n    k\n (\n    |k| \n    \u2264 10^8\n), denoting a line that is described with\nthe equation \n    y=kx\n. The lines are not necessarily distinct, \n    k\n can\nbe equal to \n    0\n. Each of the next \n    m\n lines contains \n    3\n integers\n\n    a\n, \n    b\n, and \n    c\n (\n    a, |b|, |c| \n    \u2264 10^8\n, \n    a > 0\n) \u2014\ncoefficients of equations of the parabolas \n    ax^2+bx+c\n. The parabolas are\nnot necessarily distinct. It is guaranteed that the sum \n    n\n over all test\ncases does not exceed \n    10^5\n, and the sum \n    m\n over all test cases also\ndoes not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output the answers for\neach parabola in the given order. If there is a line that does not intersect\nthe given parabola and doesn't touch it, print on a separate line the word\n\"YES\", and then on a separate line the number \n    k\n \u2014 the coefficient of\nthis line. If there are several answers, print any of them. If the line does\nnot exist, print one word \"NO\". You can output the answer in any case (upper\nor lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be\nrecognized as positive responses. The empty lines in the output in the example\nare given only for illustration, you do not need to output them (but you can).\nExample Input 5 1 2 1 1 -1 2 1 -1 3 2 2 1 4 1 2 1 2 5 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1\n100000000 100000000 100000000 100000000 2 3 0 2 2 2 1 1 -2 1 1 -2 -1 Output\nYES 1 YES 1 YES 1 YES 4 NO YES 100000000 YES 0 NO NO Note In the first test\ncase, both parabolas do not intersect the only given line \n    y=1\n    \u00b7 x\n,\nso the answer is two numbers \n    1\n. In the second test case, the line\n\n    y=x\n and the parabola \n    2x^2+5x+1\n intersect, and also the line\n\n    y=4x\n and the parabola \n    x^2+2x+1\n touch, so these pairs do not\nsatisfy the condition. So for the first parabola, the answer is \n    1\n\n(\n    y=1x\n), and for the second parabola \u2014 \n    4\n. In the third test set,\nthe line and the parabola intersect, so the answer is \"NO\".\n\n",
