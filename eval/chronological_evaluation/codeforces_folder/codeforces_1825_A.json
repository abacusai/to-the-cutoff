        "description": "LuoTianyi gives you a palindrome\n    ^\n    \u2020\n string \n    s\n, and she\nwants you to find out the length of the longest non-empty\nsubsequence\n    ^\n of \n    s\n which is not a palindrome string. If\nthere is no such subsequence, output \n    -1\n instead. \n    ^\n    \u2020\n A\npalindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example,\nstrings \"z\", \"aaa\", \"aba\", \"abccba\" are palindromes, but strings \"codeforces\",\n\"reality\", \"ab\" are not. \n    ^\n A string \n    a\n is a subsequence\nof a string \n    b\n if \n    a\n can be obtained from \n    b\n by deletion of\nseveral (possibly, zero or all) characters from \n    b\n. For example, strings\n\"a\", \"aaa\", \"bab\" are subsequences of string \"abaab\", but strings\n\"codeforces\", \"bbb\", \"h\" are not. Input Each test consists of multiple test\ncases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first and the only line of each test case contains a single string \n    s\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 |s| \n    \u2264 50\n) consisting of lowercase English letters \u2014 the\nstring that LuoTianyi gives you. It's guaranteed that \n    s\n is a palindrome\nstring. Output For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the length of the\nlongest non-empty subsequence which is not a palindrome string. If there is no\nsuch subsequence, output \n    -1\n. Example Input 4 abacaba aaa\ncodeforcesecrofedoc lol Output 6 -1 18 2 Note In the first test case, \"abcaba\"\nis a subsequence of \"abacaba\" as we can delete the third letter of \"abacaba\"\nto get \"abcaba\", and \"abcaba\" is not a palindrome string. We can prove that\n\"abcaba\" is an example of the longest subsequences of \"abacaba\" that isn't\npalindrome, so that the answer is \n    6\n. In the second test case, we can\nonly get \"a\" and \"aa\", but they are all palindrome strings, so the answer is\n\n    -1\n.\n\n",
