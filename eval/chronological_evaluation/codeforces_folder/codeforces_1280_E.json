        "name": "Kirchhoff's Current Loss",
        "description": "Your friend Kirchhoff is shocked with the current state of electronics design.\n\"Ohmygosh! Watt is wrong with the field? All these circuits are inefficient!\nThere's so much capacity for improvement. The electrical engineers must not\nconduct their classes very well. It's absolutely revolting\" he said. The\nnegativity just keeps flowing out of him, but even after complaining so many\ntimes he still hasn't lepton the chance to directly change anything. \"These\ncircuits have too much total resistance. Wire they designed this way? It's\njust causing a massive loss of resistors! Their entire field could conserve so\nmuch money if they just maximized the potential of their designs. Why can't\nthey just try alternative ideas?\" The frequency of his protests about the\nelectrical engineering department hertz your soul, so you have decided to take\ncharge and help them yourself. You plan to create a program that will optimize\nthe circuits while keeping the same circuit layout and maintaining the same\neffective resistance. A circuit has two endpoints, and is associated with a\ncertain constant, \n    R\n, called its effective resistance. The circuits we'll\nconsider will be formed from individual resistors joined together in series or\nin parallel, forming more complex circuits. The following image illustrates\ncombining circuits in series or parallel. According to your friend Kirchhoff,\nthe effective resistance can be calculated quite easily when joining circuits\nthis way: When joining \n    k\n circuits in series with effective resistances\n\n    R_1, R_2, \n    \u2026, R_k\n, the effective resistance \n    R\n of the\nresulting circuit is the sum \n    \n\n    R = R_1 + R_2 + \n    \u2026 + R_k.\n\n    \n When\njoining \n    k\n circuits in parallel with effective resistances \n    R_1, R_2,\n    \n    \u2026, R_k\n, the effective resistance \n    R\n of the resulting circuit is\nfound by solving for \n    R\n in \n    \n\n    1/R = \n    1/R_1 +\n    \n    1/R_2 + \n    \u2026 + \n    1/R_k,\n\n    \n assuming all \n    R_i >\n    0\n; if at least one \n    R_i = 0\n, then the effective resistance of the\nwhole circuit is simply \n    R = 0\n. Circuits will be represented by strings.\nIndividual resistors are represented by an asterisk, \"*\". For more complex\ncircuits, suppose \n    s_1, s_2, \n    \u2026, s_k\n represent \n    k \n    \u2265 2\n\ncircuits. Then: \"(\n    s_1\n S \n    s_2\n S \n    \u2026\n S \n    s_k\n)\"\nrepresents their series circuit; \"(\n    s_1\n P \n    s_2\n P \n    \u2026\n P\n\n    s_k\n)\" represents their parallel circuit. For example, \"(* P (* S *) P\n*)\" represents the following circuit: Given a circuit, your task is to assign\nthe resistances of the individual resistors such that they satisfy the\nfollowing requirements: Each individual resistor has a nonnegative integer\nresistance value; The effective resistance of the whole circuit is \n    r\n;\nThe sum of the resistances of the individual resistors is minimized. If there\nare \n    n\n individual resistors, then you need to output the list \n    r_1,\n    r_2, \n    \u2026, r_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 r_i\n, and \n    r_i\n is an integer), where\n\n    r_i\n is the resistance assigned to the \n    i\n-th individual resistor\nthat appears in the input (from left to right). If it is impossible to\naccomplish the task, you must say so as well. If it is possible, then it is\nguaranteed that the minimum sum of resistances is at most \n    10^18\n. Input\nThe first line of input contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    32000\n), denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain\ndescriptions of the test cases. Each test case consists of a single line\ncontaining the integer \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 10^6\n), space, and then\nthe string representing the circuit. It is guaranteed that the string is valid\nand follows the description above. The number of individual resistors (symbols\n\"*\") is at least \n    1\n and at most \n    80000\n. It is guaranteed that the\ntotal number of individual resistors across all test cases is at most\n\n    320000\n. Output For each test case, print a single line: If it's possible\nto achieve an effective resistance of \n    r\n, print \"REVOLTING\" (without\nquotes) and then \n    n\n integers \n    r_1, r_2, \n    \u2026, r_n\n \u2014 the\nresistances assigned to the individual resistors. Here, \n    n\n denotes the\nnumber of the individual resistors in the circuit. There may be multiple\npossible such assignments with a minimal sum of resistances of the individual\nresistors, you can output any of them; If it's impossible, print the string:\n\"LOSS\" (without quotes). Example Input 3 5 * 1 (* S *) 1 (* P (* S *)) Output\nREVOLTING 5 REVOLTING 1 0 REVOLTING 2 1 1 Note The following illustrates the\nthird sample case: Here, the sum of the resistances of the individual\nresistors is \n    2 + 1 + 1 = 4\n, which can be shown to be the minimum. Note\nthat there may be other assignments that achieve this minimum.\n\n",
