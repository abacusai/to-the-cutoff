        "description": "Many schoolchildren look for a job for the summer, and one day, when Gerald\nwas still a schoolboy, he also decided to work in the summer. But as Gerald\nwas quite an unusual schoolboy, he found quite unusual work. A certain Company\nagreed to pay him a certain sum of money if he draws them three identical\ncircles on a plane. The circles must not interfere with each other (but they\nmay touch each other). He can choose the centers of the circles only from the\nn options granted by the Company. He is free to choose the radius of the\ncircles himself (all three radiuses must be equal), but please note that the\nlarger the radius is, the more he gets paid. Help Gerald earn as much as\npossible. Input The first line contains a single integer n \u2014 the number of\ncenters (3 \u2264 n \u2264 3000). The following n lines each contain two integers xi, yi\n( - 10^4 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the coordinates of potential circle centers,\nprovided by the Company. All given points are distinct. Output Print a single\nreal number \u2014 maximum possible radius of circles. The answer will be accepted\nif its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10^-6. Examples Input 3 0 1 1\n0 1 1 Output 0.50000000000000000000 Input 7 2 -3 -2 -3 3 0 -3 -1 1 -2 2 -2 -1\n0 Output 1.58113883008418980000\n\n",
