        "description": "Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team\ncreates software and hardware for identification of people by their face. One\nof the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on\nshooting. People see an eye-catching gadget \u2014 a rotating camera \u2014 come up to\nit to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that\ntime. What could be better for high quality identification? But not everything\nis so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera\nrotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the\nidentification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly\ndeviated from vertical. Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation \u2014 to\nrotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from\nvertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated\nonly on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about\nthe image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big\nthat adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And\nthis solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can\napply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number\nof turns should be minimized. Help Vasya implement the program that by the\ngiven rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90\ndegrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction\ndeviation from vertical is minimum. The next figure contains frames taken from\nan unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated\n90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to \"true up\". The next\nfigure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. Input The only line\nof the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 \u2264 x \u2264 10^18) \u2014 camera angle in\ndegrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative \u2014 counter-\nclockwise. Output Output one integer \u2014 the minimum required number of 90\ndegrees clockwise turns. Examples Input 60 Output 1 Input -60 Output 3 Note\nWhen the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example),\nan image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. One 90 degrees clockwise\nturn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation\nfrom \"true up\" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of\nthe image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from\n\"true up\" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to\n120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image\nresult in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\"\nfor three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30\ndegrees counter-clockwise. From 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the\nsmallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.\n\n",
