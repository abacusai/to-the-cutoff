        "description": "There was a big bank robbery in Tablecity. In order to catch the thief, the\nPresident called none other than Albert \u2013 Tablecity\u2019s Chief of Police. Albert\ndoes not know where the thief is located, but he does know how he moves.\nTablecity can be represented as 1000 \u00d7 2 grid, where every cell represents one\ndistrict. Each district has its own unique name \u201c(X, Y)\u201d, where X and Y are\nthe coordinates of the district in the grid. The thief\u2019s movement is as Every\nhour the thief will leave the district (X, Y) he is currently hiding in, and\nmove to one of the districts: (X - 1, Y), (X + 1, Y), (X - 1, Y - 1), (X - 1,\nY + 1), (X + 1, Y - 1), (X + 1, Y + 1) as long as it exists in Tablecity.\nBelow is an example of thief\u2019s possible movements if he is located in district\n(7,1): Albert has enough people so that every hour he can pick any two\ndistricts in Tablecity and fully investigate them, making sure that if the\nthief is located in one of them, he will get caught. Albert promised the\nPresident that the thief will be caught in no more than 2015 hours and needs\nyour help in order to achieve that. Input There is no input for this problem.\nOutput The first line of output contains integer N \u2013 duration of police search\nin hours. Each of the following N lines contains exactly 4 integers Xi1, Yi1,\nXi2, Yi2 separated by spaces, that represent 2 districts (Xi1, Yi1), (Xi2,\nYi2) which got investigated during i-th hour. Output is given in chronological\norder (i-th line contains districts investigated during i-th hour) and should\nguarantee that the thief is caught in no more than 2015 hours, regardless of\nthief\u2019s initial position and movement. N \u2264 2015 1 \u2264 X \u2264 1000 1 \u2264 Y \u2264 2\nExamples Input \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0432\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430-\u0432\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430. This problem doesn't\nhave sample input and output. Output \u0421\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0438\u0436\u0435. See the note\nbelow. Note Let's consider the following output: 2 5 1 50 2 8 1 80 2 This\noutput is not guaranteed to catch the thief and is not correct. It is given to\nyou only to show the expected output format. There exists a combination of an\ninitial position and a movement strategy such that the police will not catch\nthe thief. Consider the following initial position and thief\u2019s movement: In\nthe first hour, the thief is located in district (1,1). Police officers will\nsearch districts (5,1) and (50,2) and will not find him. At the start of the\nsecond hour, the thief moves to district (2,2). Police officers will search\ndistricts (8,1) and (80,2) and will not find him. Since there is no further\ninvestigation by the police, the thief escaped!\n\n",
