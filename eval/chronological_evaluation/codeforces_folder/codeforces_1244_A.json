        "description": "Tomorrow is a difficult day for Polycarp: he has to attend \n    a\n lectures\nand \n    b\n practical classes at the university! Since Polycarp is a diligent\nstudent, he is going to attend all of them. While preparing for the\nuniversity, Polycarp wonders whether he can take enough writing implements to\nwrite all of the lectures and draw everything he has to during all of the\npractical classes. Polycarp writes lectures using a pen (he can't use a pencil\nto write lectures!); he can write down \n    c\n lectures using one pen, and\nafter that it runs out of ink. During practical classes Polycarp draws\nblueprints with a pencil (he can't use a pen to draw blueprints!); one pencil\nis enough to draw all blueprints during \n    d\n practical classes, after which\nit is unusable. Polycarp's pencilcase can hold no more than \n    k\n writing\nimplements, so if Polycarp wants to take \n    x\n pens and \n    y\n pencils,\nthey will fit in the pencilcase if and only if \n    x + y \n    \u2264 k\n. Now\nPolycarp wants to know how many pens and pencils should he take. Help him to\ndetermine it, or tell that his pencilcase doesn't have enough room for all the\nimplements he needs tomorrow! Note that you don't have to minimize the number\nof writing implements (though their total number must not exceed \n    k\n).\nInput The first line of the input contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then the test cases\nfollow. Each test case is described by one line containing five integers\n\n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    c\n, \n    d\n and \n    k\n, separated by spaces (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a, b, c, d, k \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of lectures Polycarp has to\nattend, the number of practical classes Polycarp has to attend, the number of\nlectures which can be written down using one pen, the number of practical\nclasses for which one pencil is enough, and the number of writing implements\nthat can fit into Polycarp's pencilcase, respectively. In hacks it is allowed\nto use only one test case in the input, so \n    t = 1\n should be satisfied.\nOutput For each test case, print the answer as follows: If the pencilcase\ncan't hold enough writing implements to use them during all lectures and\npractical classes, print one integer \n    -1\n. Otherwise, print two non-\nnegative integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n \u2014 the number of pens and pencils\nPolycarp should put in his pencilcase. If there are multiple answers, print\nany of them. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of writing\nimplements (though their total number must not exceed \n    k\n). Example Input\n3 7 5 4 5 8 7 5 4 5 2 20 53 45 26 4 Output 7 1 -1 1 3 Note There are many\ndifferent answers for the first test case; \n    x = 7\n, \n    y = 1\n is only\none of them. For example, \n    x = 3\n, \n    y = 1\n is also correct. \n    x =\n    1\n, \n    y = 3\n is the only correct answer for the third test case.\n\n",
