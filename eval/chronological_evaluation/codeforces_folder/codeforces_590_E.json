        "description": "Today is birthday of a Little Dasha \u2014 she is now 8 years old! On this\noccasion, each of her n friends and relatives gave her a ribbon with a\ngreeting written on it, and, as it turned out, all the greetings are\ndifferent. Dasha gathered all the ribbons and decided to throw away some of\nthem in order to make the remaining set stylish. The birthday girl considers a\nset of ribbons stylish if no greeting written on some ribbon is a substring of\nanother greeting written on some other ribbon. Let us recall that the\nsubstring of the string s is a continuous segment of s. Help Dasha to keep as\nmany ribbons as possible, so that she could brag about them to all of her\nfriends. Dasha cannot rotate or flip ribbons, that is, each greeting can be\nread in a single way given in the input. Input The first line of the input\ncontains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 750) \u2014 the number of Dasha's relatives and\nfriends. Each of the next n lines contains exactly one greeting. Each greeting\nconsists of characters 'a' and 'b' only. The total length of all greetings\nwon't exceed 10 000 000 characters. Output In the first line print the maximum\nsize of the stylish set. In the second line print the numbers of ribbons\ninvolved in it, assuming that they are numbered from 1 to n in the order they\nappear in the input. If there are several stylish sets of the maximum size,\nprint any of them. Examples Input 5 abab aba aabab ababb bab Output 2 2 5 Note\nIn the sample, the answer that keeps ribbons 3 and 4 is also considered\ncorrect.\n\n",
