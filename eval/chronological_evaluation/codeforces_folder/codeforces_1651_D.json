        "description": "You are given \n    n\n distinct points on a plane. The coordinates of the\n\n    i\n-th point are \n    (x_i, y_i)\n. For each point \n    i\n, find the\nnearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) point with integer coordinates that\nis not among the given \n    n\n points. If there are multiple such points \u2014 you\ncan choose any of them. The Manhattan distance between two points \n    (x_1,\n    y_1)\n and \n    (x_2, y_2)\n is \n    |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\n. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of points in the set. The next \n    n\n lines\ndescribe points. The \n    i\n-th of them contains two integers \n    x_i\n and\n\n    y_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i, y_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 coordinates of the\n\n    i\n-th point. It is guaranteed that all points in the input are distinct.\nOutput Print \n    n\n lines. In the \n    i\n-th line, print the point with\ninteger coordinates that is not among the given \n    n\n points and is the\nnearest (in terms of Manhattan distance) to the \n    i\n-th point from the\ninput. Output coordinates should be in range \n    [-10^6; 10^6]\n. It can be\nshown that any optimal answer meets these constraints. If there are several\nanswers, you can print any of them.
