        "description": "Another programming contest is over. You got hold of the contest's final\nresults table. The table has the following data. For each team we are shown\ntwo numbers: the number of problems and the total penalty time. However, for\nno team we are shown its final place. You know the rules of comparing the\nresults of two given teams very well. Let's say that team a solved pa problems\nwith total penalty time ta and team b solved pb problems with total penalty\ntime tb. Team a gets a higher place than team b in the end, if it either\nsolved more problems on the contest, or solved the same number of problems but\nin less total time. In other words, team a gets a higher place than team b in\nthe final results' table if either pa > pb, or pa = pb and ta < tb. It is\nconsidered that the teams that solve the same number of problems with the same\npenalty time share all corresponding places. More formally, let's say there is\na group of x teams that solved the same number of problems with the same\npenalty time. Let's also say that y teams performed better than the teams from\nthis group. In this case all teams from the group share places y + 1, y + 2,\n..., y + x. The teams that performed worse than the teams from this group, get\ntheir places in the results table starting from the y + x + 1-th place. Your\ntask is to count what number of teams from the given list shared the k-th\nplace. Input The first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 50).\nThen n lines contain the description of the teams: the i-th line contains two\nintegers pi and ti (1 \u2264 pi, ti \u2264 50) \u2014 the number of solved problems and the\ntotal penalty time of the i-th team, correspondingly. All numbers in the lines\nare separated by spaces. Output In the only line print the sought number of\nteams that got the k-th place in the final results' table. Examples Input 7 2\n4 10 4 10 4 10 3 20 2 1 2 1 1 10 Output 3 Input 5 4 3 1 3 1 5 3 3 1 3 1 Output\n4 Note The final results' table for the first sample is: 1-3 places \u2014 4 solved\nproblems, the penalty time equals 10 4 place \u2014 3 solved problems, the penalty\ntime equals 20 5-6 places \u2014 2 solved problems, the penalty time equals 1 7\nplace \u2014 1 solved problem, the penalty time equals 10 The table shows that the\nsecond place is shared by the teams that solved 4 problems with penalty time\n10. There are 3 such teams. The final table for the second sample is: 1 place\n\u2014 5 solved problems, the penalty time equals 3 2-5 places \u2014 3 solved problems,\nthe penalty time equals 1 The table shows that the fourth place is shared by\nthe teams that solved 3 problems with penalty time 1. There are 4 such teams.\n\n",
