        "description": "Long ago, Vasily built a good fence at his country house. Vasily calls a fence\ngood, if it is a series of n consecutively fastened vertical boards of\ncentimeter width, the height of each in centimeters is a positive integer. The\nhouse owner remembers that the height of the i-th board to the left is hi.\nToday Vasily decided to change the design of the fence he had built, by\ncutting his top connected part so that the fence remained good. The cut part\nshould consist of only the upper parts of the boards, while the adjacent parts\nmust be interconnected (share a non-zero length before cutting out of the\nfence). You, as Vasily's curious neighbor, will count the number of possible\nways to cut exactly one part as is described above. Two ways to cut a part are\ncalled distinct, if for the remaining fences there is such i, that the height\nof the i-th boards vary. As Vasily's fence can be very high and long, get the\nremainder after dividing the required number of ways by 1 000 000 007 (10^9 +\n7). Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1 000 000) \u2014 the number\nof boards in Vasily's fence. The second line contains n space-separated\nnumbers h1, h2, ..., hn (1 \u2264 hi \u2264 10^9), where hi equals the height of the\ni-th board to the left. Output Print the remainder after dividing r by 1 000\n000 007, where r is the number of ways to cut exactly one connected part so\nthat the part consisted of the upper parts of the boards and the remaining\nfence was good. Examples Input 2 1 1 Output 0 Input 3 3 4 2 Output 13 Note\nFrom the fence from the first example it is impossible to cut exactly one\npiece so as the remaining fence was good. All the possible variants of the\nresulting fence from the second sample look as follows (the grey shows the cut\nout part):\n\n",
