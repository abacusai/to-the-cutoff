        "description": "Duff is addicted to meat! Malek wants to keep her happy for n days. In order\nto be happy in i-th day, she needs to eat exactly ai kilograms of meat. There\nis a big shop uptown and Malek wants to buy meat for her from there. In i-th\nday, they sell meat for pi dollars per kilogram. Malek knows all numbers a1,\n..., an and p1, ..., pn. In each day, he can buy arbitrary amount of meat,\nalso he can keep some meat he has for the future. Malek is a little tired from\ncooking meat, so he asked for your help. Help him to minimize the total money\nhe spends to keep Duff happy for n days. Input The first line of input\ncontains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), the number of days. In the next n lines,\ni-th line contains two integers ai and pi (1 \u2264 ai, pi \u2264 100), the amount of\nmeat Duff needs and the cost of meat in that day. Output Print the minimum\nmoney needed to keep Duff happy for n days, in one line. Examples Input 3 1 3\n2 2 3 1 Output 10 Input 3 1 3 2 1 3 2 Output 8 Note In the first sample case:\nAn optimal way would be to buy 1 kg on the first day, 2 kg on the second day\nand 3 kg on the third day. In the second sample case: An optimal way would be\nto buy 1 kg on the first day and 5 kg (needed meat for the second and third\nday) on the second day.\n\n",
