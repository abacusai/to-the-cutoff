        "name": "A Game with Traps",
        "description": "You are playing a computer game, where you lead a party of \n    m\n soldiers.\nEach soldier is characterised by his agility \n    a_i\n. The level you are\ntrying to get through can be represented as a straight line segment from point\n\n    0\n (where you and your squad is initially located) to point \n    n + 1\n\n(where the boss is located). The level is filled with \n    k\n traps. Each trap\nis represented by three numbers \n    l_i\n, \n    r_i\n and \n    d_i\n. \n    l_i\n\nis the location of the trap, and \n    d_i\n is the danger level of the trap:\nwhenever a soldier with agility lower than \n    d_i\n steps on a trap (that is,\nmoves to the point \n    l_i\n), he gets instantly killed. Fortunately, you can\ndisarm traps: if you move to the point \n    r_i\n, you disarm this trap, and it\nno longer poses any danger to your soldiers. Traps don't affect you, only your\nsoldiers. You have \n    t\n seconds to complete the level \u2014 that is, to bring\nsome soldiers from your squad to the boss. Before the level starts, you choose\nwhich soldiers will be coming with you, and which soldiers won't be. After\nthat, you have to bring all of the chosen soldiers to the boss. To do so, you\nmay perform the following actions: if your location is \n    x\n, you may move\nto \n    x + 1\n or \n    x - 1\n. This action consumes one second; if your\nlocation is \n    x\n and the location of your squad is \n    x\n, you may move to\n\n    x + 1\n or to \n    x - 1\n with your squad in one second. You may not\nperform this action if it puts some soldier in danger (i. e. the point your\nsquad is moving into contains a non-disarmed trap with \n    d_i\n greater than\nagility of some soldier from the squad). This action consumes one second; if\nyour location is \n    x\n and there is a trap \n    i\n with \n    r_i = x\n, you\nmay disarm this trap. This action is done instantly (it consumes no time).\nNote that after each action both your coordinate and the coordinate of your\nsquad should be integers. You have to choose the maximum number of soldiers\nsuch that they all can be brought from the point \n    0\n to the point \n    n +\n    1\n (where the boss waits) in no more than \n    t\n seconds. Input The first\nline contains four integers \n    m\n, \n    n\n, \n    k\n and \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    m, n, k, t \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    n < t\n) \u2014 the number of soldiers, the\nnumber of integer points between the squad and the boss, the number of traps\nand the maximum number of seconds you may spend to bring the squad to the\nboss, respectively. The second line contains \n    m\n integers \n    a_1\n,\n\n    a_2\n, ..., \n    a_m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n), where\n\n    a_i\n is the agility of the \n    i\n-th soldier. Then \n    k\n lines follow,\ncontaining the descriptions of traps. Each line contains three numbers\n\n    l_i\n, \n    r_i\n and \n    d_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 d_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the location of the trap, the location\nwhere the trap can be disarmed, and its danger level, respectively. Output\nPrint one integer \u2014 the maximum number of soldiers you may choose so that you\nmay bring them all to the boss in no more than \n    t\n seconds. Example Input\n5 6 4 14 1 2 3 4 5 1 5 2 1 2 5 2 3 5 3 5 3 Output 3 Note In the first example\nyou may take soldiers with agility \n    3\n, \n    4\n and \n    5\n with you. The\ncourse of action is as follows: go to \n    2\n without your squad; disarm the\ntrap \n    2\n; go to \n    3\n without your squad; disartm the trap \n    3\n; go\nto \n    0\n without your squad; go to \n    7\n with your squad. The whole plan\ncan be executed in \n    13\n seconds.\n\n",
