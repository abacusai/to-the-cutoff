        "description": "Each evening after the dinner the SIS's students gather together to play the\ngame of Sport Mafia. For the tournament, Alya puts candies into the box, which\nwill serve as a prize for a winner. To do that, she performs \n    n\n actions.\nThe first action performed is to put a single candy into the box. For each of\nthe remaining moves she can choose from two options: the first option, in case\nthe box contains at least one candy, is to take exactly one candy out and eat\nit. This way the number of candies in the box decreased by \n    1\n; the second\noption is to put candies in the box. In this case, Alya will put \n    1\n more\ncandy, than she put in the previous time. Thus, if the box is empty, then it\ncan only use the second option. For example, one possible sequence of Alya's\nactions look as follows: put one candy into the box; put two candies into the\nbox; eat one candy from the box; eat one candy from the box; put three candies\ninto the box; eat one candy from the box; put four candies into the box; eat\none candy from the box; put five candies into the box; This way she will\nperform \n    9\n actions, the number of candies at the end will be \n    11\n,\nwhile Alya will eat \n    4\n candies in total. You know the total number of\nactions \n    n\n and the number of candies at the end \n    k\n. You need to find\nthe total number of sweets Alya ate. That is the number of moves of the first\noption. It's guaranteed, that for the given \n    n\n and \n    k\n the answer\nalways exists. Please note, that during an action of the first option, Alya\ntakes out and eats exactly one candy. Input The first line contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) \u2014 the total number of moves and the number of candies in the box at\nthe end. It's guaranteed, that for the given \n    n\n and \n    k\n the answer\nexists. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of candies, which Alya ate.\nPlease note, that in this problem there aren't multiple possible answers \u2014 the\nanswer is unique for any input data. Examples Input 1 1 Output 0 Input 9 11\nOutput 4 Input 5 0 Output 3 Input 3 2 Output 1 Note In the first example, Alya\nhas made one move only. According to the statement, the first move is always\nputting one candy in the box. Hence Alya ate \n    0\n candies. In the second\nexample the possible sequence of Alya's actions looks as follows: put \n    1\n\ncandy, put \n    2\n candies, eat a candy, eat a candy, put \n    3\n candies, eat\na candy, put \n    4\n candies, eat a candy, put \n    5\n candies. This way, she\nwill make exactly \n    n=9\n actions and in the end the box will contain\n\n    1+2-1-1+3-1+4-1+5=11\n candies. The answer is \n    4\n, since she ate\n\n    4\n candies in total.\n\n",
