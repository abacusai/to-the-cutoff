        "description": "Tanya likes cartoons. She knows that \n    n\n new cartoons will be released in\nhis favorite cinema: the \n    i\n-th of them will be airing from the day\n\n    a_i\n to the day \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). The\ncinema has a special offer: there is a huge discount every day when only one\ncartoon is airing. Tanya doesn't care which cartoon she will watch but she'd\nlike to save some money. That's why she asks you to find any day \n    x\n when\nonly one cartoon will be airing. Formally: find \n    x\n such that there is\nexactly one \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) with \n    a_i \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264\n    b_i\n. If there are several possible answers, print any of them. If there is\nno such day, print -1. Input The first line contains single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The following are\ndescriptions of the \n    t\n test cases. The first line of each test case\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2000\n) \u2014 the number of\ncartoons. In the next \n    n\n lines, the cartoons themselves are described,\none per line, by a pair of integers \n    a_i\n, \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the first and last airing days for the \n    i\n-th\ncartoon. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values \n    n\n for all test\ncases in the input does not exceed \n    2000\n. Output Print \n    t\n answers to\ngiven test cases in the order in which they appear in the input: the\n\n    i\n-th answer is such \n    x\n, that only one cartoon will be airing on day\n\n    x\n or -1 if there are no such days. Example Input 5 1 1 1 3 2 1000000000\n2 500000000 500000002 1000000000 3 1 2 3 4 1 4 2 4 11 4 9 3 1 5 10 10 1 5\nOutput 1 500000001 -1 10 10 Note In the third test case: at day \n    1\n and\n\n    2\n, first and third cartoons will be airing, and days \n    3\n and\n\n    4\n, second and third cartoons will be airing. So, there is no day when\nonly one cartoon will be airing. In the fourth test case, \n    11\n is also a\npossible answer.\n\n",
