        "description": "Consider the array \n    a\n composed of all the integers in the range \n    [l,\n    r]\n. For example, if \n    l = 3\n and \n    r = 7\n, then \n    a = [3, 4, 5, 6,\n    7]\n. Given \n    l\n, \n    r\n, and \n    k\n, is it possible for \n    (a)\n\nto be greater than \n    1\n after doing the following operation at most \n    k\n\ntimes? Choose \n    2\n numbers from \n    a\n. Permanently remove one occurrence\nof each of them from the array. Insert their product back into \n    a\n.\n\n    (b)\n denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers in\n\n    b\n. Input The first line of the input contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of\ntest cases follows. The input for each test case consists of a single line\ncontaining \n    3\n non-negative integers \n    l\n, \n    r\n, and \n    k\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 10^9, \n     0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 r - l\n). Output\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to have the GCD of the\ncorresponding array greater than \n    1\n by performing at most \n    k\n\noperations, and \"NO\" otherwise (case insensitive). Example Input 9 1 1 0 3 5 1\n13 13 0 4 4 0 3 7 4 4 10 3 2 4 0 1 7 3 1 5 3 Output NO NO YES YES YES YES NO\nNO YES Note For the first test case, \n    a = [1]\n, so the answer is \"NO\",\nsince the only element in the array is \n    1\n. For the second test case the\narray is \n    a = [3, 4, 5]\n and we have \n    1\n operation. After the first\noperation the array can change to: \n    [3, 20]\n, \n    [4, 15]\n or \n    [5,\n    12]\n all of which having their greatest common divisor equal to \n    1\n so\nthe answer is \"NO\". For the third test case, \n    a = [13]\n, so the answer is\n\"YES\", since the only element in the array is \n    13\n. For the fourth test\ncase, \n    a = [4]\n, so the answer is \"YES\", since the only element in the\narray is \n    4\n.\n\n",
