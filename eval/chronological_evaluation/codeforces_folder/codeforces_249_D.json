        "name": "Donkey and Stars",
        "description": "In the evenings Donkey would join Shrek to look at the stars. They would sit\non a log, sipping tea and they would watch the starry sky. The sky hung above\nthe roof, right behind the chimney. Shrek's stars were to the right of the\nchimney and the Donkey's stars were to the left. Most days the Donkey would\njust count the stars, so he knew that they are exactly n. This time he wanted\na challenge. He imagined a coordinate system: he put the origin of the\ncoordinates at the intersection of the roof and the chimney, directed the OX\naxis to the left along the roof and the OY axis \u2014 up along the chimney (see\nfigure). The Donkey imagined two rays emanating from he origin of axes at\nangles \u03b11 and \u03b12 to the OX axis. Now he chooses any star that lies strictly\nbetween these rays. After that he imagines more rays that emanate from this\nstar at the same angles \u03b11 and \u03b12 to the OX axis and chooses another star that\nlies strictly between the new rays. He repeats the operation as long as there\nstill are stars he can choose between the rays that emanate from a star. As a\nresult, the Donkey gets a chain of stars. He can consecutively get to each\nstar if he acts by the given rules. Your task is to find the maximum number of\nstars m that the Donkey's chain can contain. Note that the chain must\nnecessarily start in the point of the origin of the axes, that isn't taken\ninto consideration while counting the number m of stars in the chain. Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of stars. The\nsecond line contains simple fractions representing relationships \"a/b c/d\",\nsuch that and (0 \u2264 a, b, c, d \u2264 10^5; ; ; ). The given numbers a, b, c, d are\nintegers. Next n lines contain pairs of integers xi, yi (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 10^5)\u2014\nthe stars' coordinates. It is guaranteed that all stars have distinct\ncoordinates. Output In a single line print number m \u2014 the answer to the\nproblem. Examples Input 15 1/3 2/1 3 1 6 2 4 2 2 5 4 5 6 6 3 4 1 6 2 1 7 4 9 3\n5 3 1 3 15 5 12 4 Output 4 Note In the sample the longest chain the Donkey can\nbuild consists of four stars. Note that the Donkey can't choose the stars that\nlie on the rays he imagines.\n\n",
