        "description": "Polycarp has found a table having an infinite number of rows and columns. The\nrows are numbered from \n    1\n, starting from the topmost one. The columns are\nnumbered from \n    1\n, starting from the leftmost one. Initially, the table\nhasn't been filled and Polycarp wants to fix it. He writes integers from\n\n    1\n and so on to the table as follows. The figure shows the placement of\nthe numbers from \n    1\n to \n    10\n. The following actions are denoted by the\narrows. The leftmost topmost cell of the table is filled with the number\n\n    1\n. Then he writes in the table all positive integers beginning from\n\n    2\n sequentially using the following algorithm. First, Polycarp selects\nthe leftmost non-filled cell in the first row and fills it. Then, while the\nleft neighbor of the last filled cell is filled, he goes down and fills the\nnext cell. So he goes down until the last filled cell has a non-filled\nneighbor to the left (look at the vertical arrow going down in the figure\nabove). After that, he fills the cells from the right to the left until he\nstops at the first column (look at the horizontal row in the figure above).\nThen Polycarp selects the leftmost non-filled cell in the first row, goes\ndown, and so on. A friend of Polycarp has a favorite number \n    k\n. He wants\nto know which cell will contain the number. Help him to find the indices of\nthe row and the column, such that the intersection of the row and the column\nis the cell containing the number \n    k\n. Input The first line contains one\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then\n\n    t\n test cases follow. Each test case consists of one line containing one\ninteger \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^9\n) which location must be found.\nOutput For each test case, output in a separate line two integers \n    r\n and\n\n    c\n (\n    r, c \n    \u2265 1\n) separated by spaces \u2014 the indices of the row and\nthe column containing the cell filled by the number \n    k\n, respectively.\nExample Input 7 11 14 5 4 1 2 1000000000 Output 2 4 4 3 1 3 2 1 1 1 1 2 31623\n14130\n\n",
