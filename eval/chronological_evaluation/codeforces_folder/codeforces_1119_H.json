        "description": "You have received your birthday gifts \u2014 \n    n\n triples of integers! The\n\n    i\n-th of them is \n    { a_i, b_i, c_i\n    }\n. All\nnumbers are greater than or equal to \n    0\n, and strictly smaller than\n\n    2^k\n, where \n    k\n is a fixed integer. One day, you felt tired playing\nwith triples. So you came up with three new integers \n    x\n, \n    y\n,\n\n    z\n, and then formed \n    n\n arrays. The \n    i\n-th array consists of\n\n    a_i\n repeated \n    x\n times, \n    b_i\n repeated \n    y\n times and\n\n    c_i\n repeated \n    z\n times. Thus, each array has length \n    (x + y +\n    z)\n. You want to choose exactly one integer from each array such that the\nXOR (bitwise exclusive or) of them is equal to \n    t\n. Output the number of\nways to choose the numbers for each \n    t\n between \n    0\n and \n    2^k -\n    1\n, inclusive, modulo \n    998244353\n. Input The first line contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k\n    \n    \u2264 17\n) \u2014 the number of arrays and the binary length of all numbers. The\nsecond line contains three integers \n    x\n, \n    y\n, \n    z\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264\n    x,y,z \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the integers you chose. Then \n    n\n lines follow.\nThe \n    i\n-th of them contains three integers \n    a_i\n, \n    b_i\n and\n\n    c_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i , b_i , c_i\n    \u2264 2^k - 1\n) \u2014 the\nintegers forming the \n    i\n-th array. Output Print a single line containing\n\n    2^k\n integers. The \n    i\n-th of them should be the number of ways to\nchoose exactly one integer from each array so that their XOR is equal to \n    t\n    = i-1\n modulo \n    998244353\n. Examples Input 1 1 1 2 3 1 0 1 Output 2 4\nInput 2 2 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 2 3 Output 4 2 4 6 Input 4 3 1 2 3 1 3 7 0 2 5 1 0 6 3\n3 2 Output 198 198 126 126 126 126 198 198 Note In the first example, the\narray we formed is \n    (1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)\n, we have two choices to get\n\n    0\n as the XOR and four choices to get \n    1\n. In the second example, two\narrays are \n    (0, 1, 1, 2)\n and \n    (1, 2, 2, 3)\n. There are sixteen \n    (4\n    \n    \u00b7 4)\n choices in total, \n    4\n of them (\n    1 \n    \u2295 1\n and \n    2\n    \n    \u2295 2\n, two options for each) give \n    0\n, \n    2\n of them (\n    0\n    \n    \u2295 1\n and \n    2 \n    \u2295 3\n) give \n    1\n, \n    4\n of them (\n    0\n    \n    \u2295 2\n and \n    1 \n    \u2295 3\n, two options for each) give \n    2\n, and\nfinally \n    6\n of them (\n    0 \n    \u2295 3\n, \n    2 \n    \u2295 1\n and four\noptions for \n    1 \n    \u2295 2\n) give \n    3\n.\n\n",
