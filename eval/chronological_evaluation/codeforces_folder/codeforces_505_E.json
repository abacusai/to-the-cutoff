        "name": "Mr. Kitayuta vs. Bamboos",
        "description": "Mr. Kitayuta's garden is planted with n bamboos. (Bamboos are tall, fast-\ngrowing tropical plants with hollow stems.) At the moment, the height of the\ni-th bamboo is hi meters, and it grows ai meters at the end of each day.\nActually, Mr. Kitayuta hates these bamboos. He once attempted to cut them\ndown, but failed because their stems are too hard. Mr. Kitayuta have not given\nup, however. He has crafted Magical Hammer with his intelligence to drive them\ninto the ground. He can use Magical Hammer at most k times during each day,\ndue to his limited Magic Power. Each time he beat a bamboo with Magical\nHammer, its height decreases by p meters. If the height would become negative\nby this change, it will become 0 meters instead (it does not disappear). In\nother words, if a bamboo whose height is h meters is beaten with Magical\nHammer, its new height will be max(0, h - p) meters. It is possible to beat\nthe same bamboo more than once in a day. Mr. Kitayuta will fight the bamboos\nfor m days, starting today. His purpose is to minimize the height of the\ntallest bamboo after m days (that is, m iterations of \"Mr. Kitayuta beats the\nbamboos and then they grow\"). Find the lowest possible height of the tallest\nbamboo after m days. Input The first line of the input contains four space-\nseparated integers n, m, k and p (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 5000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10, 1 \u2264\np \u2264 10^9). They represent the number of the bamboos in Mr. Kitayuta's garden,\nthe duration of Mr. Kitayuta's fight in days, the maximum number of times that\nMr. Kitayuta beat the bamboos during each day, and the power of Magic Hammer,\nrespectively. The following n lines describe the properties of the bamboos.\nThe i-th of them (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) contains two space-separated integers hi and ai\n(0 \u2264 hi \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9), denoting the initial height and the growth\nrate of the i-th bamboo, respectively. Output Print the lowest possible height\nof the tallest bamboo after m days.
