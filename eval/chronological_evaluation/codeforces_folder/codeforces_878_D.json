        "description": "Nikita and Sasha play a computer game where you have to breed some magical\ncreatures. Initially, they have k creatures numbered from 1 to k. Creatures\nhave n different characteristics. Sasha has a spell that allows to create a\nnew creature from two given creatures. Each of its characteristics will be\nequal to the maximum of the corresponding characteristics of used creatures.\nNikita has a similar spell, but in his spell, each characteristic of the new\ncreature is equal to the minimum of the corresponding characteristics of used\ncreatures. A new creature gets the smallest unused number. They use their\nspells and are interested in some characteristics of their new creatures. Help\nthem find out these characteristics. Input The first line contains integers n,\nk and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 12, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 number of characteristics,\ncreatures and queries. Next k lines describe original creatures. The line i\ncontains n numbers ai1, ai2, ..., ain (1 \u2264 aij \u2264 10^9) \u2014 characteristics of\nthe i-th creature. Each of the next q lines contains a query. The i-th of\nthese lines contains numbers ti, xi and yi (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 3). They denote a query:\nti = 1 means that Sasha used his spell to the creatures xi and yi. ti = 2\nmeans that Nikita used his spell to the creatures xi and yi. ti = 3 means that\nthey want to know the yi-th characteristic of the xi-th creature. In this case\n1 \u2264 yi \u2264 n. It's guaranteed that all creatures' numbers are valid, that means\nthat they are created before any of the queries involving them. Output For\neach query with ti = 3 output the corresponding characteristic. Examples Input\n2 2 4 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 3 3 1 3 4 2 Output 2 1 Input 5 3 8 1 2 3 4 5 5 1 2 3\n4 4 5 1 2 3 1 1 2 1 2 3 2 4 5 3 6 1 3 6 2 3 6 3 3 6 4 3 6 5 Output 5 2 2 3 4\nNote In the first sample, Sasha makes a creature with number 3 and\ncharacteristics (2, 2). Nikita makes a creature with number 4 and\ncharacteristics (1, 1). After that they find out the first characteristic for\nthe creature 3 and the second characteristic for the creature 4.\n\n",
