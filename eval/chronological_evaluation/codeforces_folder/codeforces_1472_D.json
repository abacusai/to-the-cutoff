        "description": "During their New Year holidays, Alice and Bob play the following game using an\narray \n    a\n of \n    n\n integers: Players take turns, Alice moves first. Each\nturn a player chooses any element and removes it from the array. If Alice\nchooses even value, then she adds it to her score. If the chosen value is odd,\nAlice's score does not change. Similarly, if Bob chooses odd value, then he\nadds it to his score. If the chosen value is even, then Bob's score does not\nchange. If there are no numbers left in the array, then the game ends. The\nplayer with the highest score wins. If the scores of the players are equal,\nthen a draw is declared. For example, if \n    n = 4\n and \n    a = [5, 2, 7,\n    3]\n, then the game could go as follows (there are other options): On the\nfirst move, Alice chooses \n    2\n and get two points. Her score is now\n\n    2\n. The array \n    a\n is now \n    [5, 7, 3]\n. On the second move, Bob\nchooses \n    5\n and get five points. His score is now \n    5\n. The array\n\n    a\n is now \n    [7, 3]\n. On the third move, Alice chooses \n    7\n and get\nno points. Her score is now \n    2\n. The array \n    a\n is now \n    [3]\n. On\nthe last move, Bob chooses \n    3\n and get three points. His score is now\n\n    8\n. The array \n    a\n is empty now. Since Bob has more points at the end\nof the game, he is the winner. You want to find out who will win if both\nplayers play optimally. Note that there may be duplicate numbers in the array.\nInput The first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of\neach test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of elements in the array \n    a\n. The next line contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n)\n\u2014 the array \n    a\n used to play the game. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case, output on a separate line: \"Alice\" if Alice wins with the\noptimal play; \"Bob\" if Bob wins with the optimal play; \"Tie\", if a tie is\ndeclared during the optimal play. Example Input 4 4 5 2 7 3 3 3 2 1 4 2 2 2 2\n2 7 8 Output Bob Tie Alice Alice\n\n",
