        "description": "Everyone knows that 2010 FIFA World Cup is being held in South Africa now. By\nthe decision of BFA (Berland's Football Association) next World Cup will be\nheld in Berland. BFA took the decision to change some World Cup regulations:\nthe final tournament features n teams (n is always even) the first n / 2 teams\n(according to the standings) come through to the knockout stage the standings\nare made on the following principle: for a victory a team gets 3 points, for a\ndraw \u2014 1 point, for a defeat \u2014 0 points. In the first place, teams are ordered\nin the standings in decreasing order of their points; in the second place \u2014 in\ndecreasing order of the difference between scored and missed goals; in the\nthird place \u2014 in the decreasing order of scored goals it's written in\nBerland's Constitution that the previous regulation helps to order the teams\nwithout ambiguity. You are asked to write a program that, by the given list of\nthe competing teams and the results of all the matches, will find the list of\nteams that managed to get through to the knockout stage. Input The first input\nline contains the only integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 amount of the teams, taking\npart in the final tournament of World Cup. The following n lines contain the\nnames of these teams, a name is a string of lower-case and upper-case Latin\nletters, its length doesn't exceed 30 characters. The following n\u00b7(n - 1) / 2\nlines describe the held matches in the format name1-name2 num1:num2, where\nname1, name2 \u2014 names of the teams; num1, num2 (0 \u2264 num1, num2 \u2264 100) \u2014 amount\nof the goals, scored by the corresponding teams. Accuracy of the descriptions\nis guaranteed: there are no two team names coinciding accurate to the letters'\ncase; there is no match, where a team plays with itself; each match is met in\nthe descriptions only once. Output Output n / 2 lines \u2014 names of the teams,\nwhich managed to get through to the knockout stage in lexicographical order.\nOutput each name in a separate line. No odd characters (including spaces) are\nallowed. It's guaranteed that the described regulations help to order the\nteams without ambiguity. Examples Input 4 A B C D A-B 1:1 A-C 2:2 A-D 1:0 B-C\n1:0 B-D 0:3 C-D 0:3 Output A D Input 2 a A a-A 2:1 Output a\n\n",
