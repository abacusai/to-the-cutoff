        "description": "There are literally dozens of snooker competitions held each year, and team\nJinotega tries to attend them all (for some reason they prefer name\n\"snookah\")! When a competition takes place somewhere far from their hometown,\nIvan, Artsem and Konstantin take a flight to the contest and back. Jinotega's\nbest friends, team Base have found a list of their itinerary receipts with\ninformation about departure and arrival airports. Now they wonder, where is\nJinotega now: at home or at some competition far away? They know that: this\nlist contains all Jinotega's flights in this year (in arbitrary order),\nJinotega has only flown from his hometown to a snooker contest and back, after\neach competition Jinotega flies back home (though they may attend a\ncompetition in one place several times), and finally, at the beginning of the\nyear Jinotega was at home. Please help them to determine Jinotega's location!\nInput In the first line of input there is a single integer n: the number of\nJinotega's flights (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100). In the second line there is a string of 3\ncapital Latin letters: the name of Jinotega's home airport. In the next n\nlines there is flight information, one flight per line, in form \"XXX->YYY\",\nwhere \"XXX\" is the name of departure airport \"YYY\" is the name of arrival\nairport. Exactly one of these airports is Jinotega's home airport. It is\nguaranteed that flights information is consistent with the knowledge of\nJinotega's friends, which is described in the main part of the statement.\nOutput If Jinotega is now at home, print \"home\" (without quotes), otherwise\nprint \"contest\". Examples Input 4 SVO SVO->CDG LHR->SVO SVO->LHR CDG->SVO\nOutput home Input 3 SVO SVO->HKT HKT->SVO SVO->RAP Output contest Note In the\nfirst sample Jinotega might first fly from SVO to CDG and back, and then from\nSVO to LHR and back, so now they should be at home. In the second sample\nJinotega must now be at RAP because a flight from RAP back to SVO is not on\nthe list.\n\n",
