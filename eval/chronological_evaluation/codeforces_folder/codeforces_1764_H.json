        "description": "Doremy has \n    n\n buckets of paint which is represented by an array \n    a\n\nof length \n    n\n. Bucket \n    i\n contains paint with color \n    a_i\n.\nInitially, \n    a_i=i\n. Doremy has \n    m\n segments \n    [l_i,r_i]\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 n\n). Each segment describes an operation.\nOperation \n    i\n is performed as follows: For each \n    j\n such that \n    l_i <\n    j \n    \u2264 r_i\n, set \n    a_j := a_l_i\n. Doremy also selects an integer\n\n    k\n. She wants to know for each integer \n    x\n from \n    0\n to \n    m-1\n,\nthe number of distinct colors in the array after performing operations \n    x\n    \n     m +1, (x+1) \n     m + 1, \n    \u2026, (x+k-1) \n     m +1\n. Can you\nhelp her calculate these values? Note that for each \n    x\n individually we\nstart from the initial array and perform only the given \n    k\n operations in\nthe given order. Input The first line of input contains three integers\n\n    n\n, \n    m\n, and \n    k\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n,m\n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    k \n    \u2264 m\n) \u2014 the length of the array \n    a\n, the total number of\noperations, and the integer that Doremy selects. The \n    i\n-th line of the\nfollowing \n    m\n lines contains two integers \n    l_i\n, \n    r_i\n (\n    1\n    \u2264\n    l_i\n    \u2264 r_i\n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the bounds of the \n    i\n-th segment. Output Output\n\n    m\n integers. The \n    (x+1)\n-th integer should be the number of distinct\ncolors in the array if we start from the initial array and perform operations\n\n    x \n     m +1, (x+1) \n     m + 1, \n    \u2026, (x+k-1) \n     m +1\n.\nExamples Input 7 5 5 3 5 2 3 4 6 5 7 1 2 Output 3 3 3 3 2 Input 10 9 4 1 1 2 3\n3 4 7 9 6 8 5 7 2 4 9 10 1 3 Output 6 6 7 6 5 5 7 7 7 Note In the first test\ncase, the picture below shows the resulting array for the values of\n\n    x=0,1,2\n respectively.\n\n",
