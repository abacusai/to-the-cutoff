        "description": "Oleg Petrov loves crossword puzzles and every Thursday he buys his favorite\nmagazine with crosswords and other word puzzles. In the last magazine Oleg\nfound a curious puzzle, and the magazine promised a valuable prize for it's\nsolution. We give a formal description of the problem below. The puzzle field\nconsists of two rows, each row contains n cells. Each cell contains exactly\none small English letter. You also are given a word w, which consists of k\nsmall English letters. A solution of the puzzle is a sequence of field cells\nc1, ..., ck, such that: For all i from 1 to k the letter written in the cell\nci matches the letter wi; All the cells in the sequence are pairwise distinct;\nFor all i from 1 to k - 1 cells ci and ci + 1 have a common side.Oleg Petrov\nquickly found a solution for the puzzle. Now he wonders, how many distinct\nsolutions are there for this puzzle. Oleg Petrov doesn't like too large\nnumbers, so calculate the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. Two solutions ci and c'i are\nconsidered distinct if the sequences of cells do not match in at least one\nposition, that is there is such j in range from 1 to k, such that cj \u2260 c'j.\nInput The first two lines contain the state of the field for the puzzle. Each\nof these non-empty lines contains exactly n small English letters. The next\nline is left empty. The next line is non-empty and contains word w, consisting\nof small English letters. The length of each line doesn't exceed 2 000. Output\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of distinct solutions for the puzzle\nmodulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input code edoc code Output 4 Input aaa aaa aa\nOutput 14\n\n",
