        "description": "You have k pieces of laundry, each of which you want to wash, dry and fold.\nYou are at a laundromat that has n1 washing machines, n2 drying machines and\nn3 folding machines. Each machine can process only one piece of laundry at a\ntime. You can't dry a piece of laundry before it is washed, and you can't fold\nit before it is dried. Moreover, after a piece of laundry is washed, it needs\nto be immediately moved into a drying machine, and after it is dried, it needs\nto be immediately moved into a folding machine. It takes t1 minutes to wash\none piece of laundry in a washing machine, t2 minutes to dry it in a drying\nmachine, and t3 minutes to fold it in a folding machine. Find the smallest\nnumber of minutes that is enough to wash, dry and fold all the laundry you\nhave. Input The only line of the input contains seven integers: k, n1, n2, n3,\nt1, t2, t3 (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^4; 1 \u2264 n1, n2, n3, t1, t2, t3 \u2264 1000). Output Print one\ninteger \u2014 smallest number of minutes to do all your laundry. Examples Input 1\n1 1 1 5 5 5 Output 15 Input 8 4 3 2 10 5 2 Output 32 Note In the first example\nthere's one instance of each machine, each taking 5 minutes to complete. You\nhave only one piece of laundry, so it takes 15 minutes to process it. In the\nsecond example you start washing first two pieces at moment 0. If you start\nthe third piece of laundry immediately, then by the time it is dried, there\nwill be no folding machine available, so you have to wait, and start washing\nthird piece at moment 2. Similarly, you can't start washing next piece until\nmoment 5, since otherwise there will be no dryer available, when it is washed.\nStart time for each of the eight pieces of laundry is 0, 0, 2, 5, 10, 10, 12\nand 15 minutes respectively. The last piece of laundry will be ready after 15\n+ 10 + 5 + 2 = 32 minutes.\n\n",
