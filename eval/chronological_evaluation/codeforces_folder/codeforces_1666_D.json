        "description": "Daisy loves playing games with words. Recently, she has been playing the\nfollowing Deletive Editing word game with Daniel. Daisy picks a word, for\nexample, \"DETERMINED\". On each game turn, Daniel calls out a letter, for\nexample, 'E', and Daisy removes the first occurrence of this letter from the\nword, getting \"DTERMINED\". On the next turn, Daniel calls out a letter again,\nfor example, 'D', and Daisy removes its first occurrence, getting \"TERMINED\".\nThey continue with 'I', getting \"TERMNED\", with 'N', getting \"TERMED\", and\nwith 'D', getting \"TERME\". Now, if Daniel calls out the letter 'E', Daisy gets\n\"TRME\", but there is no way she can get the word \"TERM\" if they start playing\nwith the word \"DETERMINED\". Daisy is curious if she can get the final word of\nher choice, starting from the given initial word, by playing this game for\nzero or more turns. Your task it help her to figure this out. Input The first\nline of the input contains an integer \n    n\n \u2014 the number of test cases (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n). The following \n    n\n lines contain test cases.\nEach test case consists of two words \n    s\n and \n    t\n separated by a space.\nEach word consists of at least one and at most 30 uppercase English letters;\n\n    s\n is the Daisy's initial word for the game; \n    t\n is the final word\nthat Daisy would like to get at the end of the game. Output Output \n    n\n\nlines to the output \u2014 a single line for each test case. Output \"YES\" if it is\npossible for Daisy to get from the initial word \n    s\n to the final word\n\n    t\n by playing the Deletive Editing game. Output \"NO\" otherwise.
