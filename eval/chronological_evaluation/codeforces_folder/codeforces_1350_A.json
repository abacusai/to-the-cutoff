        "description": "Orac is studying number theory, and he is interested in the properties of\ndivisors. For two positive integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n, \n    a\n is a divisor\nof \n    b\n if and only if there exists an integer \n    c\n, such that\n\n    a\n    \u00b7 c=b\n. For \n    n \n    \u2265 2\n, we will denote as \n    f(n)\n the\nsmallest positive divisor of \n    n\n, except \n    1\n. For example,\n\n    f(7)=7,f(10)=2,f(35)=5\n. For the fixed integer \n    n\n, Orac decided to\nadd \n    f(n)\n to \n    n\n. For example, if he had an integer \n    n=5\n, the\nnew value of \n    n\n will be equal to \n    10\n. And if he had an integer\n\n    n=6\n, \n    n\n will be changed to \n    8\n. Orac loved it so much, so he\ndecided to repeat this operation several times. Now, for two positive integers\n\n    n\n and \n    k\n, Orac asked you to add \n    f(n)\n to \n    n\n exactly\n\n    k\n times (note that \n    n\n will change after each operation, so\n\n    f(n)\n may change too) and tell him the final value of \n    n\n. For\nexample, if Orac gives you \n    n=5\n and \n    k=2\n, at first you should add\n\n    f(5)=5\n to \n    n=5\n, so your new value of \n    n\n will be equal to\n\n    n=10\n, after that, you should add \n    f(10)=2\n to \n    10\n, so your new\n(and the final!) value of \n    n\n will be equal to \n    12\n. Orac may ask you\nthese queries many times. Input The first line of the input is a single\ninteger \n    t\n     (1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 100)\n: the number of times that Orac will ask\nyou. Each of the next \n    t\n lines contains two positive integers \n    n,k\n    (2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 10^6, 1\n    \u2264 k\n    \u2264 10^9)\n, corresponding to a query by Orac.\nIt is guaranteed that the total sum of \n    n\n is at most \n    10^6\n. Output\nPrint \n    t\n lines, the \n    i\n-th of them should contain the final value of\n\n    n\n in the \n    i\n-th query by Orac. Example Input 3 5 1 8 2 3 4 Output 10\n12 12 Note In the first query, \n    n=5\n and \n    k=1\n. The divisors of\n\n    5\n are \n    1\n and \n    5\n, the smallest one except \n    1\n is \n    5\n.\nTherefore, the only operation adds \n    f(5)=5\n to \n    5\n, and the result is\n\n    10\n. In the second query, \n    n=8\n and \n    k=2\n. The divisors of\n\n    8\n are \n    1,2,4,8\n, where the smallest one except \n    1\n is \n    2\n,\nthen after one operation \n    8\n turns into \n    8+(f(8)=2)=10\n. The divisors\nof \n    10\n are \n    1,2,5,10\n, where the smallest one except \n    1\n is\n\n    2\n, therefore the answer is \n    10+(f(10)=2)=12\n. In the third query,\n\n    n\n is changed as follows: \n    3 \n    \u2192 6 \n    \u2192 8 \n    \u2192 10 \n    \u2192 12\n.\n\n",
