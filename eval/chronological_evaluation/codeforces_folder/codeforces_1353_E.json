        "description": "You are given a garland consisting of \n    n\n lamps. States of the lamps are\nrepresented by the string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n. The \n    i\n-th character\nof the string \n    s_i\n equals '0' if the \n    i\n-th lamp is turned off or '1'\nif the \n    i\n-th lamp is turned on. You are also given a positive integer\n\n    k\n. In one move, you can choose one lamp and change its state (i.e. turn\nit on if it is turned off and vice versa). The garland is called\n\n    k\n-periodic if the distance between each pair of adjacent turned on lamps\nis exactly \n    k\n. Consider the case \n    k=3\n. Then garlands \"00010010\",\n\"1001001\", \"00010\" and \"0\" are good but garlands \"00101001\", \"1000001\" and\n\"01001100\" are not. Note that the garland is not cyclic, i.e. the first turned\non lamp is not going after the last turned on lamp and vice versa. Your task\nis to find the minimum number of moves you need to make to obtain\n\n    k\n-periodic garland from the given one. You have to answer \n    t\n\nindependent test cases. Input The first line of the input contains one integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 25\u00a0 000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then\n\n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of the test case contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6; 1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\nthe length of \n    s\n and the required period. The second line of the test\ncase contains the string \n    s\n consisting of \n    n\n characters '0' and '1'.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    10^6\n (\n    \u2211 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n). Output For each test case, print the\nanswer \u2014 the minimum number of moves you need to make to obtain\n\n    k\n-periodic garland from the given one.
