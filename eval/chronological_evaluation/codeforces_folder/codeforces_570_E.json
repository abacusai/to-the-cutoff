        "description": "Peppa the Pig was walking and walked into the forest. What a strange\ncoincidence! The forest has the shape of a rectangle, consisting of n rows and\nm columns. We enumerate the rows of the rectangle from top to bottom with\nnumbers from 1 to n, and the columns \u2014 from left to right with numbers from 1\nto m. Let's denote the cell at the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th\ncolumn as (r, c). Initially the pig stands in cell (1, 1), and in the end she\nwants to be in cell (n, m). Since the pig is in a hurry to get home, she can\ngo from cell (r, c), only to either cell (r + 1, c) or (r, c + 1). She cannot\nleave the forest. The forest, where the pig is, is very unusual. Some cells of\nthe forest similar to each other, and some look very different. Peppa enjoys\ntaking pictures and at every step she takes a picture of the cell where she is\nnow. The path through the forest is considered to be beautiful if photographs\ntaken on her way, can be viewed in both forward and in reverse order, showing\nthe same sequence of photos. More formally, the line formed by the cells in\norder of visiting should be a palindrome (you can read a formal definition of\na palindrome in the previous problem). Count the number of beautiful paths\nfrom cell (1, 1) to cell (n, m). Since this number can be very large,\ndetermine the remainder after dividing it by 10^9 + 7. Input The first line\ncontains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 500) \u2014 the height and width of the\nfield. Each of the following n lines contains m lowercase English letters\nidentifying the types of cells of the forest. Identical cells are represented\nby identical letters, different cells are represented by different letters.\nOutput Print a single integer \u2014 the number of beautiful paths modulo 10^9 + 7.\nExamples Input 3 4 aaab baaa abba Output 3 Note Picture illustrating\npossibilities for the sample test.\n\n",
