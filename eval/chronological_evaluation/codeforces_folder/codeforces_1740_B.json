        "description": "Pak Chanek has \n    n\n two-dimensional slices of cheese. The \n    i\n-th slice\nof cheese can be represented as a rectangle of dimensions \n    a_i \n    \u00d7\n    b_i\n. We want to arrange them on the two-dimensional plane such that: Each\nedge of each cheese is parallel to either the x-axis or the y-axis. The bottom\nedge of each cheese is a segment of the x-axis. No two slices of cheese\noverlap, but their sides can touch. They form one connected shape. Note that\nwe can arrange them in any order (the leftmost slice of cheese is not\nnecessarily the first slice of cheese). Also note that we can rotate each\nslice of cheese in any way as long as all conditions still hold. Find the\nminimum possible perimeter of the constructed shape. Input Each test contains\nmultiple test cases. The first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The following lines\ncontain the description of each test case. The first line of each test case\ncontains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of slices of cheese Pak Chanek has. The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    n\n\nlines of each test case contains two integers \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i,b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the dimensions of the \n    i\n-th slice of\ncheese. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not\nexceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, output a line\ncontaining an integer representing the minimum possible perimeter of the\nconstructed shape. Example Input 3 4 4 1 4 5 1 1 2 3 3 2 4 2 6 2 3 1 2 65\nOutput 26 24 134 Note In the first test case, a way of getting the minimum\npossible perimeter is to arrange the slices of cheese as follows. We can\ncalculate that the perimeter of the constructed shape is\n\n    2+5+1+1+1+1+3+1+5+1+2+3=26\n. It can be shown that we cannot get a smaller\nperimeter. Consider the following invalid arrangement. Even though the\nperimeter of the shape above is \n    24\n, it does not satisfy all conditions\nof the problem. The bottom edge of the \n    1 \n    \u00d7 1\n slice of cheese is\nnot a segment of the x-axis. In the second test case, a way of getting the\nminimum possible perimeter is to arrange the slices of cheese as follows. We\ncan calculate that the perimeter of the constructed shape is\n\n    2+2+2+3+2+3+2+2+2+4=24\n. It can be shown that we cannot get a smaller\nperimeter.\n\n",
