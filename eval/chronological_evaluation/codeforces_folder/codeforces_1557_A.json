        "description": "Ezzat has an array of \n    n\n integers (maybe negative). He wants to split it\ninto two non-empty subsequences \n    a\n and \n    b\n, such that every element\nfrom the array belongs to exactly one subsequence, and the value of \n    f(a) +\n    f(b)\n is the maximum possible value, where \n    f(x)\n is the average of the\nsubsequence \n    x\n. A sequence \n    x\n is a subsequence of a sequence \n    y\n\nif \n    x\n can be obtained from \n    y\n by deletion of several (possibly, zero\nor all) elements. The average of a subsequence is the sum of the numbers of\nthis subsequence divided by the size of the subsequence. For example, the\naverage of \n    [1,5,6]\n is \n    (1+5+6)/3 = 12/3 = 4\n, so \n    f([1,5,6]) =\n    4\n. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^3\n)\u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two\nlines. The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n). The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    3\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For\neach test case, print a single value \u2014 the maximum value that Ezzat can\nachieve. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error\ndoes not exceed \n    10^-6\n. Formally, let your answer be \n    a\n, and the\njury's answer be \n    b\n. Your answer is accepted if and only if \n    |a\n    - b|/\n    max(1, |b|)\n    \u2264 10^-6\n. Example Input 4 3 3 1 2 3 -7 -6 -6 3\n2 2 2 4 17 3 5 -3 Output 4.500000000 -12.500000000 4.000000000 18.666666667\nNote In the first test case, the array is \n    [3, 1, 2]\n. These are all the\npossible ways to split this array: \n    a = [3]\n, \n    b = [1,2]\n, so the\nvalue of \n    f(a) + f(b) = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5\n. \n    a = [3,1]\n, \n    b = [2]\n, so\nthe value of \n    f(a) + f(b) = 2 + 2 = 4\n. \n    a = [3,2]\n, \n    b = [1]\n, so\nthe value of \n    f(a) + f(b) = 2.5 + 1 = 3.5\n. Therefore, the maximum\npossible value \n    4.5\n.In the second test case, the array is \n    [-7, -6,\n    -6]\n. These are all the possible ways to split this array: \n    a = [-7]\n,\n\n    b = [-6,-6]\n, so the value of \n    f(a) + f(b) = (-7) + (-6) = -13\n. \n    a\n    = [-7,-6]\n, \n    b = [-6]\n, so the value of \n    f(a) + f(b) = (-6.5) + (-6) =\n    -12.5\n. Therefore, the maximum possible value \n    -12.5\n.\n\n",
