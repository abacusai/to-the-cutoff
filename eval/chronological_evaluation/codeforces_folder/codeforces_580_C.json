        "name": "Kefa and Park",
        "description": "Kefa decided to celebrate his first big salary by going to the restaurant. He\nlives by an unusual park. The park is a rooted tree consisting of n vertices\nwith the root at vertex 1. Vertex 1 also contains Kefa's house. Unfortunaely\nfor our hero, the park also contains cats. Kefa has already found out what are\nthe vertices with cats in them. The leaf vertices of the park contain\nrestaurants. Kefa wants to choose a restaurant where he will go, but\nunfortunately he is very afraid of cats, so there is no way he will go to the\nrestaurant if the path from the restaurant to his house contains more than m\nconsecutive vertices with cats. Your task is to help Kefa count the number of\nrestaurants where he can go. Input The first line contains two integers, n and\nm (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of vertices of the tree and the\nmaximum number of consecutive vertices with cats that is still ok for Kefa.\nThe second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each ai either\nequals to 0 (then vertex i has no cat), or equals to 1 (then vertex i has a\ncat). Next n - 1 lines contains the edges of the tree in the format \"xi yi\"\n(without the quotes) (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 n, xi \u2260 yi), where xi and yi are the\nvertices of the tree, connected by an edge. It is guaranteed that the given\nset of edges specifies a tree. Output A single integer \u2014 the number of\ndistinct leaves of a tree the path to which from Kefa's home contains at most\nm consecutive vertices with cats. Examples Input 4 1 1 1 0 0 1 2 1 3 1 4\nOutput 2 Input 7 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 1 3 2 4 2 5 3 6 3 7 Output 2 Note Let us\nremind you that a tree is a connected graph on n vertices and n - 1 edge. A\nrooted tree is a tree with a special vertex called root. In a rooted tree\namong any two vertices connected by an edge, one vertex is a parent (the one\ncloser to the root), and the other one is a child. A vertex is called a leaf,\nif it has no children. Note to the first sample test: The vertices containing\ncats are marked red. The restaurants are at vertices 2, 3, 4. Kefa can't go\nonly to the restaurant located at vertex 2. Note to the second sample test:\nThe restaurants are located at vertices 4, 5, 6, 7. Kefa can't go to\nrestaurants 6, 7.\n\n",
