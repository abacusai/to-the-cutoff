        "description": "One day Qwerty the Ranger witnessed two transport ships collide with each\nother. As a result, all contents of their cargo holds scattered around the\nspace. And now Qwerty wants to pick as many lost items as possible to sell\nthem later. The thing is, both ships had lots of new gravitational grippers,\ntransported to sale. A gripper is a device that can be installed on a\nspaceship and than draw items in space to itself (\"grip\") and transport them\nto the ship's cargo hold. Overall the crashed ships lost n gravitational\ngrippers: the i-th gripper is located at a point with coordinates (xi, yi).\nEach gripper has two features \u2014 pi (the power) and ri (the action radius) and\ncan grip any items with mass of no more than pi at distance no more than ri. A\ngripper itself is an item, too and it has its mass of mi. Qwerty's ship is\nlocated at point (x, y) and has an old magnetic gripper installed, its\ncharacteristics are p and r. There are no other grippers in the ship's cargo\nholds. Find the largest number of grippers Qwerty can get hold of. As he picks\nthe items, he can arbitrarily install any gripper in the cargo hold of the\nship, including the gripper he has just picked. At any moment of time the ship\ncan have only one active gripper installed. We consider all items and the\nQwerty's ship immobile when the ranger picks the items, except for when the\ngripper moves an item \u2014 then the item moves to the cargo holds and the ship\nstill remains immobile. We can assume that the ship's cargo holds have enough\nroom for all grippers. Qwerty can use any gripper he finds or the initial\ngripper an arbitrary number of times. Input The first line contains five\nintegers x, y, p, r and n ( - 10^9 \u2264 x, y \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 p, r \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 n \u2264\n250000) \u2014 the ship's initial position, the initial gripper's features and the\nnumber of grippers that got into the space during the collision. Next n lines\ncontain the grippers' descriptions: the i-th line contains five integers xi,\nyi, mi, pi, ri ( - 10^9 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 mi, pi, ri \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the i-th\ngripper's coordinates and features. It is guaranteed that all grippers are\nlocated at different points. No gripper is located at the same point with\nQwerty's ship. Output Print a single number \u2014 the maximum number of grippers\nQwerty can draw to his ship. You do not need to count the initial old magnet\ngripper. Examples Input 0 0 5 10 5 5 4 7 11 5 -7 1 4 7 8 0 2 13 5 6 2 -3 9 3 4\n13 5 1 9 9 Output 3 Note In the first sample you should get the second\ngripper, then use the second gripper to get the first one, then use the first\ngripper to get the fourth one. You cannot get neither the third gripper as it\nis too heavy, nor the fifth one as it is too far away.\n\n",
