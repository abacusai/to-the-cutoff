        "description": "Petya has a rectangular Board of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n. Initially, \n    k\n\nchips are placed on the board, \n    i\n-th chip is located in the cell at the\nintersection of \n    sx_i\n-th row and \n    sy_i\n-th column. In one action,\nPetya can move all the chips to the left, right, down or up by \n    1\n cell.\nIf the chip was in the \n    (x, y)\n cell, then after the operation: left, its\ncoordinates will be \n    (x, y - 1)\n; right, its coordinates will be \n    (x, y\n    + 1)\n; down, its coordinates will be \n    (x + 1, y)\n; up, its coordinates\nwill be \n    (x - 1, y)\n. If the chip is located by the wall of the board, and\nthe action chosen by Petya moves it towards the wall, then the chip remains in\nits current position. Note that several chips can be located in the same cell.\nFor each chip, Petya chose the position which it should visit. Note that it's\nnot necessary for a chip to end up in this position. Since Petya does not have\na lot of free time, he is ready to do no more than \n    2nm\n actions. You have\nto find out what actions Petya should do so that each chip visits the position\nthat Petya selected for it at least once. Or determine that it is not possible\nto do this in \n    2nm\n actions. Input The first line contains three integers\n\n    n, m, k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m, k \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the number of rows and\ncolumns of the board and the number of chips, respectively. The next \n    k\n\nlines contains two integers each \n    sx_i, sy_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 sx_i \n    \u2264 n, 1\n    \n    \u2264 sy_i \n    \u2264 m\n) \u2014 the starting position of the \n    i\n-th chip. The\nnext \n    k\n lines contains two integers each \n    fx_i, fy_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    fx_i \n    \u2264 n, 1 \n    \u2264 fy_i \n    \u2264 m\n) \u2014 the position that the \n    i\n-chip\nshould visit at least once. Output In the first line print the number of\noperations so that each chip visits the position that Petya selected for it at\nleast once. In the second line output the sequence of operations. To indicate\noperations left, right, down, and up, use the characters \n    L, R, D, U\n\nrespectively. If the required sequence does not exist, print -1 in the single\nline.
