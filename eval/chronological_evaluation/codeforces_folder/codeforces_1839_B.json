        "description": "You have \n    n\n lamps, numbered by integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Each\nlamp \n    i\n has two integer parameters \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n. At each\nmoment each lamp is in one of three states: it may be turned on, turned off,\nor broken. Initially all lamps are turned off. In one operation you can select\none lamp that is turned off and turn it on (you can't turn on broken lamps).\nYou receive \n    b_i\n points for turning lamp \n    i\n on. The following\nhappens after each performed operation: Let's denote the number of lamps that\nare turned on as \n    x\n (broken lamps do not count). All lamps \n    i\n such\nthat \n    a_i \n    \u2264 x\n simultaneously break, whether they were turned on or\noff. Please note that broken lamps never count as turned on and that after a\nturned on lamp breaks, you still keep points received for turning it on. You\ncan perform an arbitrary number of operations. Find the maximum number of\npoints you can get. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of lamps. Each of the next \n    n\n lines contains two integers\n\n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n, 1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014\nparameters of the \n    i\n-th lamp. It is guaranteed that sum of \n    n\n over\nall test cases doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case,\noutput one integer \u2014 the maximum number of points you can get. Example Input 4\n4 2 2 1 6 1 10 1 13 5 3 4 3 1 2 5 3 2 3 3 6 1 2 3 4 1 4 3 4 3 5 2 3 1 1 1\nOutput 15 14 20 1 Note In first test case \n    n = 4\n. One of ways to get the\nmaximum number of points is as follows: You turn lamp \n    4\n on and receive\n\n    b_4 = 13\n points. The number of lamps that are turned on is \n    1\n, so\nall lamps with \n    a_i \n    \u2264 1\n (namely lamps \n    2\n, \n    3\n and \n    4\n)\nbreak. Lamp \n    4\n is no longer turned on, so the number of lamps that are\nturned becomes \n    0\n. The only lamp you can turn on is lamp \n    1\n, as all\nother lamps are broken. You receive \n    b_1 = 2\n points for turning it on.\nThe number of lamps that are turned on is \n    1\n. As \n    a_1 = 2\n, lamp\n\n    1\n doesn't break. Your receive \n    13 + 2 = 15\n points in total. It can\nbe shown that this is the maximum number of points you can get, so the answer\nfor the first test case is \n    15\n. In the second test case, one of the ways\nto get the maximum number of points is as follows: On the first operation you\nturn on lamp \n    4\n and receive \n    2\n points. No lamps break after the\nfirst operation. On the second operation you turn on lamp \n    3\n and receive\n\n    5\n points. After the second operation, there are \n    2\n lamps turned on.\nAs \n    a_3 \n    \u2264 2\n, lamp \n    3\n breaks. On the third operation, you turn on\nlamp \n    1\n and receive \n    4\n points. On the fourth operation, you turn on\nlamp \n    5\n and receive \n    3\n points. After that there are \n    3\n lamps\nturned on: lamps \n    1\n, \n    4\n and \n    5\n. Lamps \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    4\n\nand \n    5\n simultaneously break, because for all of them \n    a_i \n    \u2264 3\n.\nYou receive \n    2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14\n points in total. It can be shown that\nthis is the maximum number of points you can get. In the third test case, one\nof the ways to get the maximum number of points is as follows: Turn the lamp\n\n    3\n on and receive \n    4\n points. Lamps \n    1\n and \n    3\n break. Turn\nthe lamp \n    2\n on and receive \n    4\n points. Turn the lamp \n    6\n on and\nreceive \n    3\n points. Lamp \n    6\n breaks. Turn the lamp \n    4\n on and\nreceive \n    4\n points. Turn the lamp \n    5\n on and receive \n    5\n points.\nLamps \n    2\n, \n    4\n and \n    5\n break. You receive \n    4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 5 =\n    20\n points in total. It can be shown that this is the maximum number of\npoints you can get.\n\n",
