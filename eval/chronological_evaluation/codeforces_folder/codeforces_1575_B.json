        "description": "Mr. Chanek lives in a city represented as a plane. He wants to build an\namusement park in the shape of a circle of radius \n    r\n. The circle must\ntouch the origin (point \n    (0, 0)\n). There are \n    n\n bird habitats that\ncan be a photo spot for the tourists in the park. The \n    i\n-th bird habitat\nis at point \n    p_i = (x_i, y_i)\n. Find the minimum radius \n    r\n of a park\nwith at least \n    k\n bird habitats inside. A point is considered to be inside\nthe park if and only if the distance between \n    p_i\n and the center of the\npark is less than or equal to the radius of the park. Note that the center and\nthe radius of the park do not need to be integers. In this problem, it is\nguaranteed that the given input always has a solution with \n    r \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the number\nof bird habitats in the city and the number of bird habitats required to be\ninside the park. The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    n\n lines contains two\nintegers \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 |x_i|, |y_i| \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe position of the \n    i\n-th bird habitat. Output Output a single real\nnumber \n    r\n denoting the minimum radius of a park with at least \n    k\n\nbird habitats inside. It is guaranteed that the given input always has a\nsolution with \n    r \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Your answer is considered correct\nif its absolute or relative error does not exceed \n    10^-4\n. Formally, let\nyour answer be \n    a\n, and the jury's answer be \n    b\n. Your answer is\naccepted if and only if \n    |a - b|/\n    max(1, |b|)\n    \u2264\n    10^-4\n. Examples Input 8 4 -3 1 -4 4 1 5 2 2 2 -2 -2 -4 -1 -1 -6 0 Output\n3.1622776589 Input 1 1 0 0 Output 0.0000000000 Note In the first example, Mr.\nChanek can put the center of the park at \n    (-3, -1)\n with radius\n\n    \u221a(10)\n    \u2248 3.162\n. It can be proven this is the minimum\n\n    r\n. The following illustrates the first example. The blue points\nrepresent bird habitats and the red circle represents the amusement park.\n\n",
