        "description": "There is an infinite chessboard, divided into cells. The cell \n    (x, y)\n is\nthe cell on the intersection of the \n    x_i\n-th row and \n    y_i\n-th column.\n\n    n\n black pawns are placed on the board, the \n    i\n-th black pawn\noccupies the cell \n    (x_i, y_i)\n. You want to capture all black pawns. In\norder to do so, you may perform the following actions: place a white pawn into\nany empty cell (any cell having integer coordinates can be chosen, as long as\nit doesn't contain any pawns); make a move with one of the white pawns\naccording to the chess rules. Recall that when you make a move with a white\npawn in the cell \n    (x, y)\n, the chess rules allow you to choose exactly one\nof these actions: if there is a black pawn in the cell \n    (x + 1, y - 1)\n,\nyou can capture it \u2014 the black pawn is removed from the board, and the white\npawn moves to \n    (x + 1, y - 1)\n; if there is a black pawn in the cell \n    (x\n    + 1, y + 1)\n, you can capture it \u2014 the black pawn is removed from the board,\nand the white pawn moves to \n    (x + 1, y + 1)\n; if the cell \n    (x + 1, y)\n\nis empty, you can move the white pawn to that cell. You may perform any finite\nsequence of actions (placing white pawns and moving them). You want to capture\nall of the black pawns, and it can be shown that it is always possible; and\nyou want to do it placing as few white pawns as possible. What is the minimum\nnumber of white pawns you have to place to capture all \n    n\n black pawns?\nInput The first line contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of black pawns. Then \n    n\n lines follow. The\n\n    i\n-th line contains two integers \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i,\n    y_i \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) denoting a black pawn in the cell \n    (x_i,\n    y_i)\n. No cell is occupied by two or more black pawns. Output Print one\ninteger \u2014 the minimum number of white pawns you have to place to capture all\n\n    n\n black pawns.
