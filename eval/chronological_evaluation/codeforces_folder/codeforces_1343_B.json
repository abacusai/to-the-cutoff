        "description": "You are given a positive integer \n    n\n, it is guaranteed that \n    n\n is\neven (i.e. divisible by \n    2\n). You want to construct the array \n    a\n of\nlength \n    n\n such that: The first \n    n/2\n elements of \n    a\n\nare even (divisible by \n    2\n); the second \n    n/2\n elements of\n\n    a\n are odd (not divisible by \n    2\n); all elements of \n    a\n are\ndistinct and positive; the sum of the first half equals to the sum of the\nsecond half (\n    \u2211\n    _i=1^\n    n/2 a_i =\n    \n    \u2211\n    _i=\n    n/2 + 1^n a_i\n). If there are multiple\nanswers, you can print any. It is not guaranteed that the answer exists. You\nhave to answer \n    t\n independent test cases. Input The first line of the\ninput contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The only line of the test case\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of the array. It is guaranteed that that \n    n\n is even (i.e.\ndivisible by \n    2\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n (\n    \u2211 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n). Output For each test case, print the answer \u2014 \"NO\" (without quotes),\nif there is no suitable answer for the given test case or \"YES\" in the first\nline and any suitable array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) satisfying conditions from the problem statement on the second line.\nExample Input 5 2 4 6 8 10 Output NO YES 2 4 1 5 NO YES 2 4 6 8 1 3 5 11 NO\n\n",
