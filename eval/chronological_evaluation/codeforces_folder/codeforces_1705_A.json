        "description": "Mark is asked to take a group photo of \n    2n\n people. The \n    i\n-th person\nhas height \n    h_i\n units. To do so, he ordered these people into two rows,\nthe front row and the back row, each consisting of \n    n\n people. However, to\nensure that everyone is seen properly, the \n    j\n-th person of the back row\nmust be at least \n    x\n units taller than the \n    j\n-th person of the front\nrow for each \n    j\n between \n    1\n and \n    n\n, inclusive. Help Mark\ndetermine if this is possible. Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case\nconsists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains two positive\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    x\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 100\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 x\n    \u2264\n    10^3\n) \u2014 the number of people in each row and the minimum difference Mark\nwants. The second line of each test case contains \n    2n\n positive integers\n\n    h_1,h_2,\n    \u2026,h_2n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 h_i\n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2014 the height of\neach person in units. Note that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases is not\nbounded. Output For each test case, print a single line containing \"YES\" if\nMark could arrange people satisfying his condition and \"NO\" otherwise. You may\nprint each letter in any case (for example, YES, Yes, yes, yEs will all be\nrecognized as positive answers). Example Input 3 3 6 1 3 9 10 12 16 3 1 2 5 2\n2 2 5 1 2 8 6 Output YES NO YES Note In the first test case, one possible\norder is to have the third, fifth, and sixth person on the back row and the\nsecond, first, and fourth on the front row. The heights of the people will\nlook like this. Back\n    9\n\n    12\n\n    16\nFront\n    3\n\n    1\n\n    10\n It\nworks because \n    h_3-h_2 = 9-3 \n    \u2265 6\n, \n    h_5-h_1 = 12-1\n    \u2265 6\n, and\n\n    h_6-h_4 = 16-10\n    \u2265 6\n. In the second test case, it can be shown there\nis no way to order people in a way that satisfies the condition. In the third\ntest case, the only way to arrange people to satisfy the condition is to have\nthe first person on the back row and the second person on the front row.\n\n",
