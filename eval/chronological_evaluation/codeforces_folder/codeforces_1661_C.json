        "description": "There are \n    n\n trees in a park, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. The\ninitial height of the \n    i\n-th tree is \n    h_i\n. You want to water these\ntrees, so they all grow to the same height. The watering process goes as\nfollows. You start watering trees at day \n    1\n. During the \n    j\n-th day\nyou can: Choose a tree and water it. If the day is odd (e.g. \n    1, 3, 5, 7,\n    \n    \u2026\n), then the height of the tree increases by \n    1\n. If the day is\neven (e.g. \n    2, 4, 6, 8, \n    \u2026\n), then the height of the tree increases\nby \n    2\n. Or skip a day without watering any tree. Note that you can't water\nmore than one tree in a day. Your task is to determine the minimum number of\ndays required to water the trees so they grow to the same height. You have to\nanswer \n    t\n independent test cases. Input The first line of the input\ncontains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. The first line of the test case contains one integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of trees. The\nsecond line of the test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    h_1, h_2, \n    \u2026,\n    h_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 h_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), where \n    h_i\n is the height of the\n\n    i\n-th tree. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n (\n    \u2211 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n).\nOutput For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of days\nrequired to water the trees, so they grow to the same height. Example Input 3\n3 1 2 4 5 4 4 3 5 5 7 2 5 4 8 3 7 4 Output 4 3 16 Note Consider the first test\ncase of the example. The initial state of the trees is \n    [1, 2, 4]\n. During\nthe first day, let's water the first tree, so the sequence of heights becomes\n\n    [2, 2, 4]\n; during the second day, let's water the second tree, so the\nsequence of heights becomes \n    [2, 4, 4]\n; let's skip the third day; during\nthe fourth day, let's water the first tree, so the sequence of heights becomes\n\n    [4, 4, 4]\n. Thus, the answer is \n    4\n.\n\n",
