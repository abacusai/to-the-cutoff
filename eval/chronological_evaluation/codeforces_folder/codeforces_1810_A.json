        "description": "A sequence of \n    m\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_m\n is good, if\nand only if there exists at least one \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 m\n) such\nthat \n    a_i = i\n. For example, \n    [3,2,3]\n is a good sequence, since\n\n    a_2 = 2\n, \n    a_3 = 3\n, while \n    [3,1,1]\n is not a good sequence,\nsince there is no \n    i\n such that \n    a_i = i\n. A sequence \n    a\n is\nbeautiful, if and only if there exists at least one subsequence of \n    a\n\nsatisfying that this subsequence is good. For example, \n    [4,3,2]\n is a\nbeautiful sequence, since its subsequence \n    [4,2]\n is good, while\n\n    [5,3,4]\n is not a beautiful sequence. A sequence \n    b\n is a subsequence\nof a sequence \n    a\n if \n    b\n can be obtained from \n    a\n by the deletion\nof several (possibly, zero or all) elements. Now you are given a sequence,\ncheck whether it is beautiful or not. Input Each test contains multiple test\ncases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    500\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Their description follows. The first line\nof each test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014\nthe length of the given sequence. The second line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264\n    10^9\n), representing the sequence. Output For each test case, output \"YES\"\nor \"NO\"(without quotes) in one line, representing whether the given sequence\nis beautiful. You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For\nexample, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as\npositive responses.

In the fourth test case, the good subsequence is \n    b=[1]\n,\nwhere \n    b_1 = 1\n. In the fifth test case, the good subsequence is\n\n    b=[2,2]\n, where \n    b_2 = 2\n.\n\n",
