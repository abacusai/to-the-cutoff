        "description": "Today we will be playing a red and white colouring game (no, this is not the\nRussian Civil War; these are just the colours of the Canadian flag). You are\ngiven an \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n grid of \"R\", \"W\", and \".\" characters. \"R\" is red,\n\"W\" is white and \".\" is blank. The neighbours of a cell are those that share\nan edge with it (those that only share a corner do not count). Your job is to\ncolour the blank cells red or white so that every red cell only has white\nneighbours (and no red ones) and every white cell only has red neighbours (and\nno white ones). You are not allowed to recolour already coloured cells. Input\nThe first line contains \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n), the number of\ntest cases. In each test case, the first line will contain \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    n \n    \u2264 50\n) and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 50\n), the height and width of\nthe grid respectively. The next \n    n\n lines will contain the grid. Each\ncharacter of the grid is either 'R', 'W', or '.'. Output For each test case,\noutput \"YES\" if there is a valid grid or \"NO\" if there is not. If there is,\noutput the grid on the next \n    n\n lines. If there are multiple answers,\nprint any. In the output, the \"YES\"s and \"NO\"s are case-insensitive, meaning\nthat outputs such as \"yEs\" and \"nO\" are valid. However, the grid is case-\nsensitive. Example Input 3 4 6 .R.... ...... ...... .W.... 4 4 .R.W .... ....\n.... 5 1 R W R W R Output YES WRWRWR RWRWRW WRWRWR RWRWRW NO YES R W R W R\nNote The answer for the first example case is given in the example output, and\nit can be proven that no grid exists that satisfies the requirements of the\nsecond example case. In the third example all cells are initially coloured,\nand the colouring is valid.\n\n",
