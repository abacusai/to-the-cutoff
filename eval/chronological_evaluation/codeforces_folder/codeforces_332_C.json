        "name": "Students' Revenge",
        "description": "A student's life is fraught with complications. Some Berland University\nstudents know this only too well. Having studied for two years, they\ncontracted strong antipathy towards the chairperson of some department.\nIndeed, the person in question wasn't the kindest of ladies to begin with:\nprone to reforming groups, banning automatic passes and other mean deeds. At\nlast the students decided that she just can't get away with all this\nanymore... The students pulled some strings on the higher levels and learned\nthat the next University directors' meeting is going to discuss n orders about\nthe chairperson and accept exactly p of them. There are two values assigned to\neach order: ai is the number of the chairperson's hairs that turn grey if she\nobeys the order and bi \u2014 the displeasement of the directors if the order isn't\nobeyed. The students may make the directors pass any p orders chosen by them.\nThe students know that the chairperson will obey exactly k out of these p\norders. She will pick the orders to obey in the way that minimizes first, the\ndirectors' displeasement and second, the number of hairs on her head that turn\ngrey. The students want to choose p orders in the way that maximizes the\nnumber of hairs on the chairperson's head that turn grey. If there are\nmultiple ways to accept the orders, then the students are keen on maximizing\nthe directors' displeasement with the chairperson's actions. Help them. Input\nThe first line contains three integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), p (1 \u2264 p \u2264 n), k (1 \u2264\nk \u2264 p) \u2014 the number of orders the directors are going to discuss, the number\nof orders to pass and the number of orders to be obeyed by the chairperson,\ncorrespondingly. Each of the following n lines contains two integers ai and bi\n(1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 10^9), describing the corresponding order. Output Print in an\narbitrary order p distinct integers \u2014 the numbers of the orders to accept so\nthat the students could carry out the revenge. The orders are indexed from 1\nto n in the order they occur in the input. If there are multiple solutions,\nyou can print any of them. Examples Input 5 3 2 5 6 5 8 1 3 4 3 4 11 Output 3\n1 2 Input 5 3 3 10 18 18 17 10 20 20 18 20 18 Output 2 4 5 Note In the first\nsample one of optimal solutions is to pass orders 1, 2, 3. In this case the\nchairperson obeys orders number 1 and 2. She gets 10 new grey hairs in the\nhead and the directors' displeasement will equal 3. Note that the same result\ncan be achieved with order 4 instead of order 3. In the second sample, the\nchairperson can obey all the orders, so the best strategy for the students is\nto pick the orders with the maximum sum of ai values. The chairperson gets 58\nnew gray hairs and the directors' displeasement will equal 0.\n\n",
