        "description": "Student Valera is an undergraduate student at the University. His end of term\nexams are approaching and he is to pass exactly n exams. Valera is a smart\nguy, so he will be able to pass any exam he takes on his first try. Besides,\nhe can take several exams on one day, and in any order. According to the\nschedule, a student can take the exam for the i-th subject on the day number\nai. However, Valera has made an arrangement with each teacher and the teacher\nof the i-th subject allowed him to take an exam before the schedule time on\nday bi (bi < ai). Thus, Valera can take an exam for the i-th subject either on\nday ai, or on day bi. All the teachers put the record of the exam in the\nstudent's record book on the day of the actual exam and write down the date of\nthe mark as number ai. Valera believes that it would be rather strange if the\nentries in the record book did not go in the order of non-decreasing date.\nTherefore Valera asks you to help him. Find the minimum possible value of the\nday when Valera can take the final exam if he takes exams so that all the\nrecords in his record book go in the order of non-decreasing date. Input The\nfirst line contains a single positive integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5000) \u2014 the number of\nexams Valera will take. Each of the next n lines contains two positive space-\nseparated integers ai and bi (1 \u2264 bi < ai \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the date of the exam in\nthe schedule and the early date of passing the i-th exam, correspondingly.\nOutput Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible number of the day when\nValera can take the last exam if he takes all the exams so that all the\nrecords in his record book go in the order of non-decreasing date. Examples\nInput 3 5 2 3 1 4 2 Output 2 Input 3 6 1 5 2 4 3 Output 6 Note In the first\nsample Valera first takes an exam in the second subject on the first day (the\nteacher writes down the schedule date that is 3). On the next day he takes an\nexam in the third subject (the teacher writes down the schedule date, 4), then\nhe takes an exam in the first subject (the teacher writes down the mark with\ndate 5). Thus, Valera takes the last exam on the second day and the dates will\ngo in the non-decreasing order: 3, 4, 5. In the second sample Valera first\ntakes an exam in the third subject on the fourth day. Then he takes an exam in\nthe second subject on the fifth day. After that on the sixth day Valera takes\nan exam in the first subject.\n\n",
