        "description": "Gildong is playing a video game called Block Adventure. In Block Adventure,\nthere are \n    n\n columns of blocks in a row, and the columns are numbered\nfrom \n    1\n to \n    n\n. All blocks have equal heights. The height of the\n\n    i\n-th column is represented as \n    h_i\n, which is the number of blocks\nstacked in the \n    i\n-th column. Gildong plays the game as a character that\ncan stand only on the top of the columns. At the beginning, the character is\nstanding on the top of the \n    1\n-st column. The goal of the game is to move\nthe character to the top of the \n    n\n-th column. The character also has a\nbag that can hold infinitely many blocks. When the character is on the top of\nthe \n    i\n-th column, Gildong can take one of the following three actions as\nmany times as he wants: if there is at least one block on the column, remove\none block from the top of the \n    i\n-th column and put it in the bag; if\nthere is at least one block in the bag, take one block out of the bag and\nplace it on the top of the \n    i\n-th column; if \n    i < n\n and \n    |h_i -\n    h_i+1| \n    \u2264 k\n, move the character to the top of the \n    i+1\n-st column.\n\n    k\n is a non-negative integer given at the beginning of the game. Note\nthat it is only possible to move to the next column. In actions of the first\ntwo types the character remains in the \n    i\n-th column, and the value\n\n    h_i\n changes. The character initially has \n    m\n blocks in the bag.\nGildong wants to know if it is possible to win the game. Help Gildong find the\nanswer to his question. Input Each test contains one or more test cases. The\nfirst line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    1000\n). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test\ncase contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    100\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^6\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number\nof columns in the game, the number of blocks in the character's bag at the\nbeginning, and the non-negative integer \n    k\n described in the statement.\nThe second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers. The \n    i\n-th\ninteger is \n    h_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 h_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n), the initial height of the\n\n    i\n-th column. Output For each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to\nwin the game. Otherwise, print \"NO\". You can print each letter in any case\n(upper or lower). Example Input 5 3 0 1 4 3 5 3 1 2 1 4 7 4 10 0 10 20 10 20 2\n5 5 0 11 1 9 9 99 Output YES NO YES NO YES Note In the first case, Gildong can\ntake one block from the \n    1\n-st column, move to the \n    2\n-nd column, put\nthe block on the \n    2\n-nd column, then move to the \n    3\n-rd column. In the\nsecond case, Gildong has to put the block in his bag on the \n    1\n-st column\nto get to the \n    2\n-nd column. But it is impossible to get to the \n    3\n-rd\ncolumn because \n    |h_2 - h_3| = 3 > k\n and there is no way to decrease the\ngap. In the fifth case, the character is already on the \n    n\n-th column from\nthe start so the game is won instantly.\n\n",
