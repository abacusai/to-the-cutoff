        "description": "Cold winter evenings in Tomsk are very boring \u2014 nobody wants be on the streets\nat such a time. Residents of Tomsk while away the time sitting in warm\napartments, inventing a lot of different games. One of such games is 'Colored\nJenga'. This game requires wooden blocks of three colors: red, green and blue.\nA tower of n levels is made from them. Each level consists of three wooden\nblocks. The blocks in each level can be of arbitrary colors, but they are\nalways located close and parallel to each other. An example of such a tower is\nshown in the figure. The game is played by exactly one person. Every minute a\nplayer throws a special dice which has six sides. Two sides of the dice are\ngreen, two are blue, one is red and one is black. The dice shows each side\nequiprobably. If the dice shows red, green or blue, the player must take any\nblock of this color out of the tower at this minute so that the tower doesn't\nfall. If this is not possible, the player waits until the end of the minute,\nwithout touching the tower. He also has to wait until the end of the minute\nwithout touching the tower if the dice shows the black side. It is not allowed\nto take blocks from the top level of the tower (whether it is completed or\nnot). Once a player got a block out, he must put it on the top of the tower so\nas to form a new level or finish the upper level consisting of previously\nplaced blocks. The newly constructed levels should have all the same\nproperties as the initial levels. If the upper level is not completed,\nstarting the new level is prohibited. For the tower not to fall, in each of\nthe levels except for the top, there should be at least one block. Moreover,\nif at some of these levels there is exactly one block left and this block is\nnot the middle block, the tower falls. The game ends at the moment when there\nis no block in the tower that you can take out so that the tower doesn't fall.\nHere is a wonderful game invented by the residents of the city of Tomsk. I\nwonder for how many minutes can the game last if the player acts optimally\nwell? If a player acts optimally well, then at any moment he tries to choose\nthe block he takes out so as to minimize the expected number of the game\nduration. Your task is to write a program that determines the expected number\nof the desired amount of minutes. Input The first line of the input contains\nthe only integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 6) \u2014 the number of levels in the tower. Then n\nlines follow, describing the levels of the tower from the bottom to the top\n(the first line is the top of the tower). Each level is described by three\ncharacters, the first and the third of them set the border blocks of the level\nand the second one is the middle block. The character that describes the block\nhas one of the following values 'R' (a red block), 'G' (a green block) and 'B'\n(a blue block). Output In the only line of the output print the sought\nmathematical expectation value. The answer will be considered correct if its\nrelative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10^-6. Examples Input 6 RGB GRG BBB\nGGR BRG BRB Output 17.119213696601992\n\n",
