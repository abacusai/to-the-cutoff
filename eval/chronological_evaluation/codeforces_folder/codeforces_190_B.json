        "description": "So, the Berland is at war with its eternal enemy Flatland again, and Vasya, an\naccountant, was assigned to fulfil his duty to the nation. Right now the\nsituation in Berland is dismal \u2014 their both cities are surrounded! The armies\nof flatlanders stand on the borders of circles, the circles' centers are in\nthe surrounded cities. At any moment all points of the flatland ring can begin\nto move quickly in the direction of the city \u2014 that's the strategy the\nflatlanders usually follow when they besiege cities. The berlanders are sure\nthat they can repel the enemy's attack if they learn the exact time the attack\nstarts. For that they need to construct a radar that would register any\nmovement at the distance of at most r from it. Thus, we can install a radar at\nsuch point, that at least one point of the enemy ring will be in its detecting\nrange (that is, at a distance of at most r). Then the radar can immediately\ninform about the enemy's attack. Due to the newest technologies, we can place\na radar at any point without any problems. But the problem is that the\nberlanders have the time to make only one radar. Besides, the larger the\ndetection radius (r) is, the more the radar costs. That's why Vasya's task\n(that is, your task) is to find the minimum possible detection radius for the\nradar. In other words, your task is to find the minimum radius r (r \u2265 0) such,\nthat a radar with radius r can be installed at some point and it can register\nthe start of the movements of both flatland rings from that point. In this\nproblem you can consider the cities as material points, the attacking enemy\nrings - as circles with centers in the cities, the radar's detection range \u2014\nas a disk (including the border) with the center at the point where the radar\nis placed. Input The input files consist of two lines. Each line represents\nthe city and the flatland ring that surrounds it as three space-separated\nintegers xi, yi, ri (|xi|, |yi| \u2264 10^4; 1 \u2264 ri \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the city's\ncoordinates and the distance from the city to the flatlanders,\ncorrespondingly. It is guaranteed that the cities are located at different\npoints. Output Print a single real number \u2014 the minimum detection radius of\nthe described radar. The answer is considered correct if the absolute or\nrelative error does not exceed 10^-6. Examples Input 0 0 1 6 0 3 Output\n1.000000000000000 Input -10 10 3 10 -10 3 Output 11.142135623730951 Note The\nfigure below shows the answer to the first sample. In this sample the best\ndecision is to put the radar at point with coordinates (2, 0). The figure\nbelow shows the answer for the second sample. In this sample the best decision\nis to put the radar at point with coordinates (0, 0).\n\n",
