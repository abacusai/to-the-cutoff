        "name": "Gregor and the Two Painters",
        "description": "Two painters, Amin and Benj, are repainting Gregor's living room ceiling! The\nceiling can be modeled as an \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n grid. For each \n    i\n between\n\n    1\n and \n    n\n, inclusive, painter Amin applies \n    a_i\n layers of paint\nto the entire \n    i\n-th row. For each \n    j\n between \n    1\n and \n    m\n,\ninclusive, painter Benj applies \n    b_j\n layers of paint to the entire\n\n    j\n-th column. Therefore, the cell \n    (i,j)\n ends up with \n    a_i+b_j\n\nlayers of paint. Gregor considers the cell \n    (i,j)\n to be badly painted if\n\n    a_i+b_j \n    \u2264 x\n. Define a badly painted region to be a maximal connected\ncomponent of badly painted cells, i. e. a connected component of badly painted\ncells such that all adjacent to the component cells are not badly painted. Two\ncells are considered adjacent if they share a side. Gregor is appalled by the\nstate of the finished ceiling, and wants to know the number of badly painted\nregions. Input The first line contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n and\n\n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n,m \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the dimensions of Gregor's ceiling, and the maximum number of paint\nlayers in a badly painted cell. The second line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n), the\nnumber of paint layers Amin applies to each row. The third line contains\n\n    m\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_j \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n), the number of paint layers Benj applies to each column. Output Print\na single integer, the number of badly painted regions. Examples Input 3 4 11 9\n8 5 10 6 7 2 Output 2 Input 3 4 12 9 8 5 10 6 7 2 Output 1 Input 3 3 2 1 2 1 1\n2 1 Output 4 Input 5 23 6 1 4 3 5 2 2 3 1 6 1 5 5 6 1 3 2 6 2 3 1 6 1 4 1 6 1\n5 5 Output 6 Note The diagram below represents the first example. The numbers\nto the left of each row represent the list \n    a\n, and the numbers above each\ncolumn represent the list \n    b\n. The numbers inside each cell represent the\nnumber of paint layers in that cell. The colored cells correspond to badly\npainted cells. The red and blue cells respectively form \n    2\n badly painted\nregions.\n\n",
