        "description": "You are given three integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, and \n    d\n. Your task is to\nfind any integer \n    x\n which satisfies all of the following conditions, or\ndetermine that no such integers exist: \n    0 \n    \u2264 x \n     2^60\n; \n    a|x\n\nis divisible by \n    d\n; \n    b|x\n is divisible by \n    d\n. Here, \n    |\n\ndenotes the bitwise OR operation. Input Each test contains multiple test\ncases. The first line of input contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one\nline, containing three integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, and \n    d\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    a,b,d \n     2^30\n). Output For each test case print one integer. If there\nexists an integer \n    x\n which satisfies all of the conditions from the\nstatement, print \n    x\n. Otherwise, print \n    -1\n. If there are multiple\nsolutions, you may print any of them.

In the second test case, \n    x=14\n is\none of the possible solutions, since \n    8|14=6|14=14\n, which is a multiple\nof \n    d=14\n. In the third and fourth test cases, we can show that there are\nno solutions.\n\n",
