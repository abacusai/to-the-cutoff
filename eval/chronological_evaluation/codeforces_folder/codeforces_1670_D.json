        "description": "Sehr Sus is an infinite hexagonal grid as pictured below, controlled by\nMennaFadali, ZerooCool and Hosssam. They love equilateral triangles and want\nto create \n    n\n equilateral triangles on the grid by adding some straight\nlines. The triangles must all be empty from the inside (in other words, no\nstraight line or hexagon edge should pass through any of the triangles). You\nare allowed to add straight lines parallel to the edges of the hexagons. Given\n\n    n\n, what is the minimum number of lines you need to add to create at\nleast \n    n\n equilateral triangles as described? Adding two red lines results\nin two new yellow equilateral triangles. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. Each test case contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the required number of\nequilateral triangles. Output For each test case, print the minimum number of\nlines needed to have \n    n\n or more equilateral triangles. Example Input 4 1\n2 3 4567 Output 2 2 3 83 Note In the first and second test cases only 2 lines\nare needed. After adding the first line, no equilateral triangles will be\ncreated no matter where it is added. But after adding the second line, two\nmore triangles will be created at once. In the third test case, the minimum\nneeded is 3 lines as shown below.\n\n",
