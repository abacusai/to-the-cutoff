        "description": "Way to go! Heidi now knows how many brains there must be for her to get one.\nBut throwing herself in the midst of a clutch of hungry zombies is quite a\nrisky endeavor. Hence Heidi wonders: what is the smallest number of brains\nthat must be in the chest for her to get out at all (possibly empty-handed,\nbut alive)? The brain dinner night will evolve just as in the previous\nsubtask: the same crowd is present, the N - 1 zombies have the exact same\nmindset as before and Heidi is to make the first proposal, which must be\naccepted by at least half of the attendees for her to survive. Input The only\nline of input contains one integer: N, the number of attendees (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^9).\nOutput Output one integer: the smallest number of brains in the chest which\nallows Heidi to merely survive. Examples Input 1 Output 0 Input 3 Output 1\nInput 99 Output 49\n\n",
