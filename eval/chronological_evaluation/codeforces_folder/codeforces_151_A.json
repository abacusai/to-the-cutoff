        "description": "This winter is so cold in Nvodsk! A group of n friends decided to buy k\nbottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle\nhas l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them\ninto d slices. After that they found p grams of salt. To make a toast, each\nfriend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of\nsalt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all\ndrink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make? Input The first\nand only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not\nexceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one\nspace. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of toasts each friend can\nmake. Examples Input 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 Output 2 Input 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\nOutput 3 Input 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 Output 0 Note A comment to the first\nsample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is\nenough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\nand the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends\nin the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\n",
