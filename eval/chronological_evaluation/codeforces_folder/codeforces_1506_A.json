        "description": "Polycarp found a rectangular table consisting of \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n\ncolumns. He noticed that each cell of the table has its number, obtained by\nthe following algorithm \"by columns\": cells are numbered starting from one;\ncells are numbered from left to right by columns, and inside each column from\ntop to bottom; number of each cell is an integer one greater than in the\nprevious cell. For example, if \n    n = 3\n and \n    m = 5\n, the table will be\nnumbered as follows: \n    \n\n    1     4     7     10     13 \n    \n    \n     2     5\n        8     11     14 \n    \n    \n     3     6     9     12     15\n\n    \n\nHowever, Polycarp considers such numbering inconvenient. He likes the\nnumbering \"by rows\": cells are numbered starting from one; cells are numbered\nfrom top to bottom by rows, and inside each row from left to right; number of\neach cell is an integer one greater than the number of the previous cell. For\nexample, if \n    n = 3\n and \n    m = 5\n, then Polycarp likes the following\ntable numbering: \n    \n\n    1     2     3     4     5 \n    \n    \n     6     7     8    \n    9     10 \n    \n    \n     11     12     13     14     15\n\n    \n Polycarp\ndoesn't have much time, so he asks you to find out what would be the cell\nnumber in the numbering \"by rows\", if in the numbering \"by columns\" the cell\nhas the number \n    x\n? Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). Then \n    t\n test cases follow. Each test case\nconsists of a single line containing three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, \n    x\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 10^6\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 n \n    \u00b7 m\n), where\n\n    n\n and \n    m\n are the number of rows and columns in the table, and\n\n    x\n is the cell number. Note that the numbers in some test cases do not\nfit into the \n    32\n-bit integer type, so you must use at least the\n\n    64\n-bit integer type of your programming language. Output For each test\ncase, output the cell number in the numbering \"by rows\". Example Input 5 1 1 1\n2 2 3 3 5 11 100 100 7312 1000000 1000000 1000000000000 Output 1 2 9 1174\n1000000000000\n\n",
