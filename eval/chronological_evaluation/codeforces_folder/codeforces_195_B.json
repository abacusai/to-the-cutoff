        "description": "After a team finished their training session on Euro football championship,\nValeric was commissioned to gather the balls and sort them into baskets.\nOverall the stadium has n balls and m baskets. The baskets are positioned in a\nrow from left to right and they are numbered with numbers from 1 to m,\ncorrespondingly. The balls are numbered with numbers from 1 to n. Valeric\ndecided to sort the balls in the order of increasing of their numbers by the\nfollowing scheme. He will put each new ball in the basket with the least\nnumber of balls. And if he's got several variants, he chooses the basket which\nstands closer to the middle. That means that he chooses the basket for which\nis minimum, where i is the number of the basket. If in this case Valeric still\nhas multiple variants, he chooses the basket with the minimum number. For\nevery ball print the number of the basket where it will go according to\nValeric's scheme. Note that the balls are sorted into baskets in the order of\nincreasing numbers, that is, the first ball goes first, then goes the second\nball and so on. Input The first line contains two space-separated integers n,\nm (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of balls and baskets, correspondingly. Output\nPrint n numbers, one per line. The i-th line must contain the number of the\nbasket for the i-th ball. Examples Input 4 3 Output 2 1 3 2 Input 3 1 Output 1\n1 1\n\n",
