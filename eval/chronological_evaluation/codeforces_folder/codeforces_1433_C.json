        "name": "Dominant Piranha",
        "description": "There are \n    n\n piranhas with sizes \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n in the\naquarium. Piranhas are numbered from left to right in order they live in the\naquarium. Scientists of the Berland State University want to find if there is\ndominant piranha in the aquarium. The piranha is called dominant if it can eat\nall the other piranhas in the aquarium (except itself, of course). Other\npiranhas will do nothing while the dominant piranha will eat them. Because the\naquarium is pretty narrow and long, the piranha can eat only one of the\nadjacent piranhas during one move. Piranha can do as many moves as it needs\n(or as it can). More precisely: The piranha \n    i\n can eat the piranha\n\n    i-1\n if the piranha \n    i-1\n exists and \n    a_i - 1 < a_i\n. The\npiranha \n    i\n can eat the piranha \n    i+1\n if the piranha \n    i+1\n exists\nand \n    a_i + 1 < a_i\n. When the piranha \n    i\n eats some piranha, its\nsize increases by one (\n    a_i\n becomes \n    a_i + 1\n). Your task is to find\nany dominant piranha in the aquarium or determine if there are no such\npiranhas. Note that you have to find any (exactly one) dominant piranha, you\ndon't have to find all of them. For example, if \n    a = [5, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n,\nthen the third piranha can be dominant. Consider the sequence of its moves:\nThe piranha eats the second piranha and \n    a\n becomes \n    [5,\n    \n    5, 4, 5]\n (the underlined piranha is our candidate). The\npiranha eats the third piranha and \n    a\n becomes \n    [5, \n    6,\n    5]\n. The piranha eats the first piranha and \n    a\n becomes\n\n    [\n    7, 5]\n. The piranha eats the second piranha and \n    a\n\nbecomes \n    [\n    8]\n. You have to answer \n    t\n independent test\ncases. Input The first line of the input contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test\ncases follow. The first line of the test case contains one integer \n    n\n\n(\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of piranhas in the\naquarium. The second line of the test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), where \n    a_i\n is the\nsize of the \n    i\n-th piranha. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n does\nnot exceed \n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n (\n    \u2211 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). Output\nFor each test case, print the answer: -1 if there are no dominant piranhas in\nthe aquarium or index of any dominant piranha otherwise. If there are several\nanswers, you can print any. Example Input 6 5 5 3 4 4 5 3 1 1 1 5 4 4 3 4 4 5\n5 5 4 3 2 3 1 1 2 5 5 4 3 5 5 Output 3 -1 4 3 3 1 Note The first test case of\nthe example is described in the problem statement. In the second test case of\nthe example, there are no dominant piranhas in the aquarium. In the third test\ncase of the example, the fourth piranha can firstly eat the piranha to the\nleft and the aquarium becomes \n    [4, 4, 5, 4]\n, then it can eat any other\npiranha in the aquarium.\n\n",
