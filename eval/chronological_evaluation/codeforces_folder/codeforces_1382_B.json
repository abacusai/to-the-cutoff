        "description": "There are \n    n\n piles of stones, where the \n    i\n-th pile has \n    a_i\n\nstones. Two people play a game, where they take alternating turns removing\nstones. In a move, a player may remove a positive number of stones from the\nfirst non-empty pile (the pile with the minimal index, that has at least one\nstone). The first player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty)\nloses the game. If both players play optimally, determine the winner of the\ngame. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264\n    1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Next \n    2t\n lines contain descriptions\nof test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of piles. The second line of\neach test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264\n    a_i\n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 \n    a_i\n is equal to the number of stones in the\n\n    i\n-th pile. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n for all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, if the player who makes\nthe first move will win, output \"First\". Otherwise, output \"Second\". Example\nInput 7 3 2 5 4 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 1000000000 5 1\n2 2 1 1 3 1 1 1 Output First Second Second First First Second First Note In\nthe first test case, the first player will win the game. His winning strategy\nis: The first player should take the stones from the first pile. He will take\n\n    1\n stone. The numbers of stones in piles will be \n    [1, 5, 4]\n. The\nsecond player should take the stones from the first pile. He will take \n    1\n\nstone because he can't take any other number of stones. The numbers of stones\nin piles will be \n    [0, 5, 4]\n. The first player should take the stones from\nthe second pile because the first pile is empty. He will take \n    4\n stones.\nThe numbers of stones in piles will be \n    [0, 1, 4]\n. The second player\nshould take the stones from the second pile because the first pile is empty.\nHe will take \n    1\n stone because he can't take any other number of stones.\nThe numbers of stones in piles will be \n    [0, 0, 4]\n. The first player\nshould take the stones from the third pile because the first and second piles\nare empty. He will take \n    4\n stones. The numbers of stones in piles will be\n\n    [0, 0, 0]\n. The second player will lose the game because all piles will\nbe empty.\n\n",
