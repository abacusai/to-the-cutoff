        "description": "Important: All possible tests are in the pretest, so you shouldn't hack on\nthis problem. So, if you passed pretests, you will also pass the system test.\nYou are an adventurer currently journeying inside an evil temple. After\ndefeating a couple of weak monsters, you arrived at a square room consisting\nof tiles forming an n \u00d7 n grid, surrounded entirely by walls. At the end of\nthe room lies a door locked with evil magical forces. The following\ninscriptions are written on the door: The sound of clashing rocks will awaken\nthe door! Being a very senior adventurer, you immediately realize what this\nmeans. In the room next door lies an infinite number of magical rocks. There\nare four types of rocks: '^': this rock moves upwards; '<': this rock moves\nleftwards; '>': this rock moves rightwards; 'v': this rock moves downwards. To\nopen the door, you first need to place the rocks on some of the tiles (one\ntile can be occupied by at most one rock). Then, you select a single rock that\nyou have placed and activate it. The activated rock will then move in its\ndirection until it hits another rock or hits the walls of the room (the rock\nwill not move if something already blocks it in its chosen direction). The\nrock then deactivates. If it hits the walls, or if there have been already\n10^7 events of rock becoming activated, the movements end. Otherwise, the rock\nthat was hit becomes activated and this procedure is repeated. If a rock moves\nat least one cell before hitting either the wall or another rock, the hit\nproduces a sound. The door will open once the number of produced sounds is at\nleast x. It is okay for the rocks to continue moving after producing x sounds.\nThe following picture illustrates the four possible scenarios of moving rocks.\nMoves at least one cell, then hits another rock. A sound is produced, the hit\nrock becomes activated. Moves at least one cell, then hits the wall (i.e., the\nside of the room). A sound is produced, the movements end. Does not move\nbecause a rock is already standing in the path. The blocking rock becomes\nactivated, but no sounds are produced. Does not move because the wall is in\nthe way. No sounds are produced and the movements end. Assume there's an\ninfinite number of rocks of each type in the neighboring room. You know what\nto do: place the rocks and open the door! Input The first line will consists\nof two integers n and x, denoting the size of the room and the number of\nsounds required to open the door. There will be exactly three test cases for\nthis problem: n = 5, x = 5; n = 3, x = 2; n = 100, x = 10^5. All of these\ntestcases are in pretest. Output Output n lines. Each line consists of n\ncharacters \u2014 the j-th character of the i-th line represents the content of the\ntile at the i-th row and the j-th column, and should be one of these: '^',\n'<', '>', or 'v': a rock as described in the problem statement. '.': an empty\ntile. Then, output two integers r and c (1 \u2264 r, c \u2264 n) on the next line \u2014 this\nmeans that the rock you activate first is located at the r-th row from above\nand c-th column from the left. There must be a rock in this cell. If there are\nmultiple solutions, you may output any of them. Examples Input 5 5 Output\n>...v v.<.. ..^.. >.... ..^.< 1 1 Input 3 2 Output >vv ^<. ^.< 1 3 Note Here's\na simulation of the first example, accompanied with the number of sounds\nproduced so far. 0 sound 1 sound 2 sounds 3 sounds 4 sounds still 4 sounds In\nthe picture above, the activated rock switches between the '^' rock and the\n'<' rock. However, no sound is produced since the '^' rock didn't move even a\nsingle tile. So, still 4 sound. 5 sounds At this point, 5 sound are already\nproduced, so this solution is already correct. However, for the sake of\nexample, we will continue simulating what happens. 6 sounds 7 sounds still 7\nsounds 8 sounds And the movement stops. In total, it produces 8 sounds. Notice\nthat the last move produced sound. Here's a simulation of the second example:\n0 sound 1 sound 2 sounds Now, the activated stone will switch continuously\nfrom one to another without producing a sound until it reaches the 10^7 limit,\nafter which the movement will cease. In total, it produced exactly 2 sounds,\nso the solution is correct.\n\n",
