        "description": "ALT is a planet in a galaxy called \"Encore\". Humans rule this planet but for\nsome reason there's no dog in their planet, so the people there are sad and\ndepressed. Rick and Morty are universal philanthropists and they want to make\npeople in ALT happy. ALT has n cities numbered from 1 to n and n - 1\nbidirectional roads numbered from 1 to n - 1. One can go from any city to any\nother city using these roads. There are two types of people in ALT: Guardians.\nA guardian lives in a house alongside a road and guards the road. Citizens. A\ncitizen lives in a house inside a city and works in an office in another city.\nEvery person on ALT is either a guardian or a citizen and there's exactly one\nguardian alongside each road. Rick and Morty talked to all the people in ALT,\nand here's what they got: There are m citizens living in ALT. Citizen number i\nlives in city number xi and works in city number yi. Every day each citizen\nwill go through all roads along the shortest path from his home to his work. A\ncitizen will be happy if and only if either he himself has a puppy himself or\nall of guardians along his path to his work has a puppy (he sees the\nguardian's puppy in each road and will be happy). A guardian is always happy.\nYou need to tell Rick and Morty the minimum number of puppies they need in\norder to make all people in ALT happy, and also provide an optimal way to\ndistribute these puppies. Input The first line of input contains two integers\nn and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^4, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 number of cities and number of\ncitizens respectively. The next n - 1 lines contain the roads, i-th line\ncontains endpoint of i-th edge, v and u (1 \u2264 v, u \u2264 n, v \u2260 u). The next m\nlines contain the information about citizens. i-th line contains two integers\nxi and yi (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 n, xi \u2260 yi). Output In the first line of input print a\nsingle integer k, the total number of puppies they need (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n). In the\nsecond line print an integer q, the number of puppies to give to citizens,\nfollowed by q distinct integers a1, a2, ..., aq, index of citizens to give\npuppy to (0 \u2264 q \u2264 min(m, k), 1 \u2264 ai \u2264 m). In the third line print an integer\ne, the number of puppies to give to guardians, followed by e distinct integers\nb1, b2, ..., be, index of road of guardians to give puppy to (0 \u2264 e \u2264 min(n -\n1, k), 1 \u2264 bi \u2264 n - 1). Sum of q and e should be equal to k.
