        "description": "There are \n    n\n segments drawn on a plane; the \n    i\n-th segment connects\ntwo points (\n    x_i, 1\n, \n    y_i, 1\n) and (\n    x_i, 2\n, \n    y_i,\n    2\n). Each segment is non-degenerate, and is either horizontal or vertical \u2014\nformally, for every \n    i \n    \u2208 [1, n]\n either \n    x_i, 1 = x_i, 2\n or\n\n    y_i, 1 = y_i, 2\n (but only one of these conditions holds). Only\nsegments of different types may intersect: no pair of horizontal segments\nshares any common points, and no pair of vertical segments shares any common\npoints. We say that four segments having indices \n    h_1\n, \n    h_2\n,\n\n    v_1\n and \n    v_2\n such that \n    h_1 < h_2\n and \n    v_1 < v_2\n form a\nrectangle if the following conditions hold: segments \n    h_1\n and \n    h_2\n\nare horizontal; segments \n    v_1\n and \n    v_2\n are vertical; segment\n\n    h_1\n intersects with segment \n    v_1\n; segment \n    h_2\n intersects with\nsegment \n    v_1\n; segment \n    h_1\n intersects with segment \n    v_2\n;\nsegment \n    h_2\n intersects with segment \n    v_2\n. Please calculate the\nnumber of ways to choose four segments so they form a rectangle. Note that the\nconditions \n    h_1 < h_2\n and \n    v_1 < v_2\n should hold. Input The first\nline contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the number of\nsegments. Then \n    n\n lines follow. The \n    i\n-th line contains four\nintegers \n    x_i, 1\n, \n    y_i, 1\n, \n    x_i, 2\n and \n    y_i, 2\n\ndenoting the endpoints of the \n    i\n-th segment. All coordinates of the\nendpoints are in the range \n    [-5000, 5000]\n. It is guaranteed that each\nsegment is non-degenerate and is either horizontal or vertical. Furthermore,\nif two segments share a common point, one of these segments is horizontal, and\nanother one is vertical. Output Print one integer \u2014 the number of ways to\nchoose four segments so they form a rectangle.
