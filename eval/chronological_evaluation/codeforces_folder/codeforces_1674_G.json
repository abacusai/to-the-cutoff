        "description": "You are given a directed acyclic graph, consisting of \n    n\n vertices and\n\n    m\n edges. The vertices are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. There are no\nmultiple edges and self-loops. Let \n    \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b_v\n be the number of\nincoming edges (indegree) and \n    \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61_v\n be the number of outgoing\nedges (outdegree) of vertex \n    v\n. You are asked to remove some edges from\nthe graph. Let the new degrees be \n    \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b'_v\n and\n\n    \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61'_v\n. You are only allowed to remove the edges if the\nfollowing conditions hold for every vertex \n    v\n: \n    \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b'_v <\n    \n    \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b_v\n or \n    \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b'_v = \n    \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b_v = 0\n;\n\n    \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61'_v < \n    \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61_v\n or \n    \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61'_v =\n    \n    \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61_v = 0\n. Let's call a set of vertices \n    S\n cute if for each\npair of vertices \n    v\n and \n    u\n (\n    v \n    \u2260 u\n) such that \n    v \n    \u2208\n    S\n and \n    u \n    \u2208 S\n, there exists a path either from \n    v\n to \n    u\n\nor from \n    u\n to \n    v\n over the non-removed edges. What is the maximum\npossible size of a cute set \n    S\n after you remove some edges from the graph\nand both indegrees and outdegrees of all vertices either decrease or remain\nequal to \n    0\n? Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of vertices and the number of edges of the graph. Each\nof the next \n    m\n lines contains two integers \n    v\n and \n    u\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 v, u \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    v \n    \u2260 u\n) \u2014 the description of an edge. The\ngiven edges form a valid directed acyclic graph. There are no multiple edges.\nOutput Print a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible size of a cute set\n\n    S\n after you remove some edges from the graph and both indegrees and\noutdegrees of all vertices either decrease or remain equal to \n    0\n.\nExamples Input 3 3 1 2 2 3 1 3 Output 2 Input 5 0 Output 1 Input 7 8 7 1 1 3 6\n2 2 3 7 2 2 4 7 3 6 3 Output 3 Note In the first example, you can remove edges\n\n    (1, 2)\n and \n    (2, 3)\n. \n    \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b = [0, 1, 2]\n,\n\n    \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61 = [2, 1, 0]\n. \n    \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b' = [0, 0, 1]\n,\n\n    \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61' = [1, 0, 0]\n. You can see that for all \n    v\n the\nconditions hold. The maximum cute set \n    S\n is formed by vertices \n    1\n\nand \n    3\n. They are still connected directly by an edge, so there is a path\nbetween them. In the second example, there are no edges. Since all\n\n    \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b_v\n and \n    \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61_v\n are equal to \n    0\n, leaving\na graph with zero edges is allowed. There are \n    5\n cute sets, each contains\na single vertex. Thus, the maximum size is \n    1\n. In the third example, you\ncan remove edges \n    (7, 1)\n, \n    (2, 4)\n, \n    (1, 3)\n and \n    (6, 2)\n.\nThe maximum cute set will be \n    S = \n    \n    7, 3, 2\n. You can remove edge\n\n    (7, 3)\n as well, and the answer won't change. Here is the picture of the\ngraph from the third example:\n\n",
