        "name": "Polo the Penguin and Houses ",
        "description": "Little penguin Polo loves his home village. The village has n houses, indexed\nby integers from 1 to n. Each house has a plaque containing an integer, the\ni-th house has a plaque containing integer pi (1 \u2264 pi \u2264 n). Little penguin\nPolo loves walking around this village. The walk looks like that. First he\nstands by a house number x. Then he goes to the house whose number is written\non the plaque of house x (that is, to house px), then he goes to the house\nwhose number is written on the plaque of house px (that is, to house ppx), and\nso on. We know that: When the penguin starts walking from any house indexed\nfrom 1 to k, inclusive, he can walk to house number 1. When the penguin starts\nwalking from any house indexed from k + 1 to n, inclusive, he definitely\ncannot walk to house number 1. When the penguin starts walking from house\nnumber 1, he can get back to house number 1 after some non-zero number of\nwalks from a house to a house. You need to find the number of ways you may\nwrite the numbers on the houses' plaques so as to fulfill the three above\ndescribed conditions. Print the remainder after dividing this number by\n1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Input The single line contains two space-separated\nintegers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 min(8, n)) \u2014 the number of the houses\nand the number k from the statement. Output In a single line print a single\ninteger \u2014 the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Examples\nInput 5 2 Output 54 Input 7 4 Output 1728\n\n",
