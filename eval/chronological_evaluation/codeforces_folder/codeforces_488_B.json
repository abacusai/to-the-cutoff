        "description": "There is an old tradition of keeping 4 boxes of candies in the house in\nCyberland. The numbers of candies are special if their arithmetic mean, their\nmedian and their range are all equal. By definition, for a set x1, x2, x3,\nx4 (x1 \u2264 x2 \u2264 x3 \u2264 x4) arithmetic mean is , median is and range is x4 - x1.\nThe arithmetic mean and median are not necessary integer. It is well-known\nthat if those three numbers are same, boxes will create a \"debugging field\"\nand codes in the field will have no bugs. For example, 1, 1, 3, 3 is the\nexample of 4 numbers meeting the condition because their mean, median and\nrange are all equal to 2. Jeff has 4 special boxes of candies. However,\nsomething bad has happened! Some of the boxes could have been lost and now\nthere are only n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 4) boxes remaining. The i-th remaining box contains\nai candies. Now Jeff wants to know: is there a possible way to find the number\nof candies of the 4 - n missing boxes, meeting the condition above (the mean,\nmedian and range are equal)? Input The first line of input contains an only\ninteger n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 4). The next n lines contain integers ai, denoting the\nnumber of candies in the i-th box (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 500). Output In the first output\nline, print \"YES\" if a solution exists, or print \"NO\" if there is no solution.\nIf a solution exists, you should output 4 - n more lines, each line containing\nan integer b, denoting the number of candies in a missing box. All your\nnumbers b must satisfy inequality 1 \u2264 b \u2264 10^6. It is guaranteed that if there\nexists a positive integer solution, you can always find such b's meeting the\ncondition. If there are multiple answers, you are allowed to print any of\nthem. Given numbers ai may follow in any order in the input, not necessary in\nnon-decreasing. ai may have stood at any positions in the original set, not\nnecessary on lowest n first positions. Examples Input 2 1 1 Output YES 3 3\nInput 3 1 1 1 Output NO Input 4 1 2 2 3 Output YES Note For the first sample,\nthe numbers of candies in 4 boxes can be 1, 1, 3, 3. The arithmetic mean, the\nmedian and the range of them are all 2. For the second sample, it's impossible\nto find the missing number of candies. In the third example no box has been\nlost and numbers satisfy the condition. You may output b in any order.\n\n",
