        "name": "Choosing Balls",
        "description": "There are n balls. They are arranged in a row. Each ball has a color (for\nconvenience an integer) and an integer value. The color of the i-th ball is ci\nand the value of the i-th ball is vi. Squirrel Liss chooses some balls and\nmakes a new sequence without changing the relative order of the balls. She\nwants to maximize the value of this sequence. The value of the sequence is\ndefined as the sum of following values for each ball (where a and b are given\nconstants): If the ball is not in the beginning of the sequence and the color\nof the ball is same as previous ball's color, add (the value of the ball) \u00d7 a.\nOtherwise, add (the value of the ball) \u00d7 b. You are given q queries. Each\nquery contains two integers ai and bi. For each query find the maximal value\nof the sequence she can make when a = ai and b = bi. Note that the new\nsequence can be empty, and the value of an empty sequence is defined as zero.\nInput The first line contains two integers n and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5; 1 \u2264 q \u2264\n500). The second line contains n integers: v1, v2, ..., vn (|vi| \u2264 10^5). The\nthird line contains n integers: c1, c2, ..., cn (1 \u2264 ci \u2264 n). The following q\nlines contain the values of the constants a and b for queries. The i-th of\nthese lines contains two integers ai and bi (|ai|, |bi| \u2264 10^5). In each line\nintegers are separated by single spaces. Output For each query, output a line\ncontaining an integer \u2014 the answer to the query. The i-th line contains the\nanswer to the i-th query in the input order. Please, do not write the \nspecifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the\ncin, cout streams or the \n1 2 1 1 5 1 -2 1 1 0 Output 20 9 4 Input 4 1 -3 6 -1 2 1 2 3 1 1 -1 Output 5\nNote In the first example, to achieve the maximal value: In the first query,\nyou should select 1st, 3rd, and 4th ball. In the second query, you should\nselect 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th ball. In the third query, you should select 2nd\nand 4th ball. Note that there may be other ways to achieve the maximal value.\n\n",
