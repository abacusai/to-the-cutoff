        "description": "The \n    gcdSum\n of a positive integer is the \n    gcd\n of that\ninteger with its sum of digits. Formally, \n    gcdSum\n    (x) = gcd(x,\n    \n     sum of digits of  x)\n for a positive integer \n    x\n. \n    gcd(a,\n    b)\n denotes the greatest common divisor of \n    a\n and \n    b\n \u2014 the largest\ninteger \n    d\n such that both integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n are divisible by\n\n    d\n. For example: \n    gcdSum\n    (762) = gcd(762, 7 + 6 +\n    2)=gcd(762,15) = 3\n. Given an integer \n    n\n, find the smallest integer\n\n    x \n    \u2265 n\n such that \n    gcdSum\n    (x) > 1\n. Input The first\nline of input contains one integer \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4)\n \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. Then \n    t\n lines follow, each containing a single\ninteger \n    n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^18)\n. All test cases in one test\nare different. Output Output \n    t\n lines, where the \n    i\n-th line is a\nsingle integer containing the answer to the \n    i\n-th test case. Example\nInput 3 11 31 75 Output 12 33 75 Note Let us explain the three test cases in\nthe sample. Test case 1: \n    n = 11\n: \n    gcdSum\n    (11) = gcd(11,\n    1 + 1) = gcd(11,\n     2) = 1\n. \n    gcdSum\n    (12) = gcd(12, 1 + 2) =\n    gcd(12,\n     3) = 3\n. So the smallest number \n    \u2265 11\n whose \n    gcdSum\n\n\n    > 1\n is \n    12\n. Test case 2: \n    n = 31\n: \n    gcdSum\n    (31)\n    = gcd(31, 3 + 1) = gcd(31,\n     4) = 1\n. \n    gcdSum\n    (32) =\n    gcd(32, 3 + 2) = gcd(32,\n     5) = 1\n. \n    gcdSum\n    (33) = gcd(33,\n    3 + 3) = gcd(33,\n     6) = 3\n. So the smallest number \n    \u2265 31\n whose\n\n    gcdSum\n \n    > 1\n is \n    33\n. Test case 3: \n    n = 75\n:\n\n    gcdSum\n    (75) = gcd(75, 7 + 5) = gcd(75,\n     12) = 3\n. The\n\n    gcdSum\n of \n    75\n is already \n    > 1\n. Hence, it is the\nanswer.\n\n",
