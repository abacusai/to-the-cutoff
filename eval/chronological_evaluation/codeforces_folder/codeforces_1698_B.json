        "description": "There are \n    n\n piles of sand where the \n    i\n-th pile has \n    a_i\n blocks\nof sand. The \n    i\n-th pile is called too tall if \n    1 < i < n\n and \n    a_i\n    > a_i-1 + a_i+1\n. That is, a pile is too tall if it has more sand than\nits two neighbours combined. (Note that piles on the ends of the array cannot\nbe too tall.) You are given an integer \n    k\n. An operation consists of\npicking \n    k\n consecutive piles of sand and adding one unit of sand to them\nall. Formally, pick \n    1 \n    \u2264 l,r \n    \u2264 n\n such that \n    r-l+1=k\n. Then\nfor all \n    l \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 r\n, update \n    a_i \n     a_i+1\n. What is the\nmaximum number of piles that can simultaneously be too tall after some\n(possibly zero) operations? Input The input consists of multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The first\nline of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264\n    n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the number of piles\nof sand and the size of the operation, respectively. The second line of each\ntest case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the sizes of the piles. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case, output a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of piles that are\nsimultaneously too tall after some (possibly zero) operations. Example Input 3\n5 2 2 9 2 4 1 4 4 1 3 2 1 3 1 1 3 1 Output 2 0 1 Note In the first test case,\nwe can perform the following three operations: Add one unit of sand to piles\n\n    1\n and \n    2\n: \n    [\n    3, \n    10, 2, 4, 1]\n. Add\none unit of sand to piles \n    4\n and \n    5\n: \n    [3, 10, 2, \n    5,\n    \n    2]\n. Add one unit of sand to piles \n    3\n and \n    4\n:\n\n    [3, 10, \n    3, \n    6, 2]\n. Now piles \n    2\n and\n\n    4\n are too tall, so in this case the answer is \n    2\n. It can be shown\nthat it is impossible to make more than \n    2\n piles too tall.In the second\ntest case, any operation will increase all piles by \n    1\n unit, so the\nnumber of too tall piles will always be \n    0\n. In the third test case, we\ncan increase any pile by \n    1\n unit of sand. It can be shown that the\nmaximum number of too tall piles is \n    1\n.\n\n",
