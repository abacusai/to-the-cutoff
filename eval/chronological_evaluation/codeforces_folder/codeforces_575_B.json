        "description": "Ruritania is a country with a very badly maintained road network, which is not\nexactly good news for lorry drivers that constantly have to do deliveries. In\nfact, when roads are maintained, they become one-way. It turns out that it is\nsometimes impossible to get from one town to another in a legal way \u2013 however,\nwe know that all towns are reachable, though illegally! Fortunately for us,\nthe police tend to be very corrupt and they will allow a lorry driver to break\nthe rules and drive in the wrong direction provided they receive \u2018a small\ngift\u2019. There is one patrol car for every road and they will request 1000\nRuritanian dinars when a driver drives in the wrong direction. However, being\ngreedy, every time a patrol car notices the same driver breaking the rule,\nthey will charge double the amount of money they requested the previous time\non that particular road. Borna is a lorry driver that managed to figure out\nthis bribing pattern. As part of his job, he has to make K stops in some towns\nall over Ruritania and he has to make these stops in a certain order. There\nare N towns (enumerated from 1 to N) in Ruritania and Borna\u2019s initial location\nis the capital city i.e. town 1. He happens to know which ones out of the N -\n1 roads in Ruritania are currently unidirectional, but he is unable to compute\nthe least amount of money he needs to prepare for bribing the police. Help\nBorna by providing him with an answer and you will be richly rewarded. Input\nThe first line contains N, the number of towns in Ruritania. The following N -\n1 lines contain information regarding individual roads between towns. A road\nis represented by a tuple of integers (a,b,x), which are separated with a\nsingle whitespace character. The numbers a and b represent the cities\nconnected by this particular road, and x is either 0 or 1: 0 means that the\nroad is bidirectional, 1 means that only the a \u2192 b direction is legal. The\nnext line contains K, the number of stops Borna has to make. The final line of\ninput contains K positive integers s1, \u2026, sK: the towns Borna has to visit. 1\n\u2264 N \u2264 10^5 1 \u2264 K \u2264 10^6 1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 N for all roads for all roads 1 \u2264 si \u2264 N\nfor all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 K Output The output should contain a single number: the least\namount of thousands of Ruritanian dinars Borna should allocate for bribes,\nmodulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input 5 1 2 0 2 3 0 5 1 1 3 4 1 5 5 4 5 2 2 Output 4\nNote Borna first takes the route 1 \u2192 5 and has to pay 1000 dinars. After that,\nhe takes the route 5 \u2192 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 4 and pays nothing this time. However, when\nhe has to return via 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 2 \u2192 1 \u2192 5, he needs to prepare 3000 (1000+2000)\ndinars. Afterwards, getting to 2 via 5 \u2192 1 \u2192 2 will cost him nothing. Finally,\nhe doesn't even have to leave town 2 to get to 2, so there is no need to\nprepare any additional bribe money. Hence he has to prepare 4000 dinars in\ntotal.\n\n",
