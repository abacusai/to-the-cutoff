        "description": "There is a long plate s containing n digits. Iahub wants to delete some digits\n(possibly none, but he is not allowed to delete all the digits) to form his\n\"magic number\" on the plate, a number that is divisible by 5. Note that, the\nresulting number may contain leading zeros. Now Iahub wants to count the\nnumber of ways he can obtain magic number, modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Two\nways are different, if the set of deleted positions in s differs. Look at the\ninput part of the statement, s is given in a special form. Input In the first\nline you're given a string a (1 \u2264 |a| \u2264 10^5), containing digits only. In the\nsecond line you're given an integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9). The plate s is formed by\nconcatenating k copies of a together. That is n = |a|\u00b7k. Output Print a single\ninteger \u2014 the required number of ways modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Examples\nInput 1256 1 Output 4 Input 13990 2 Output 528 Input 555 2 Output 63 Note In\nthe first case, there are four possible ways to make a number that is\ndivisible by 5: 5, 15, 25 and 125. In the second case, remember to concatenate\nthe copies of a. The actual plate is 1399013990. In the third case, except\ndeleting all digits, any choice will do. Therefore there are 2^6 - 1 = 63\npossible ways to delete digits.\n\n",
