        "description": "Anton likes to play chess, and so does his friend Danik. Once they have played\nn games in a row. For each game it's known who was the winner \u2014 Anton or\nDanik. None of the games ended with a tie. Now Anton wonders, who won more\ngames, he or Danik? Help him determine this. Input The first line of the input\ncontains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of games played.\nThe second line contains a string s, consisting of n uppercase English letters\n'A' and 'D' \u2014 the outcome of each of the games. The i-th character of the\nstring is equal to 'A' if the Anton won the i-th game and 'D' if Danik won the\ni-th game. Output If Anton won more games than Danik, print \"Anton\" (without\nquotes) in the only line of the output. If Danik won more games than Anton,\nprint \"Danik\" (without quotes) in the only line of the output. If Anton and\nDanik won the same number of games, print \"Friendship\" (without quotes).\nExamples Input 6 ADAAAA Output Anton Input 7 DDDAADA Output Danik Input 6\nDADADA Output Friendship Note In the first sample, Anton won 6 games, while\nDanik \u2014 only 1. Hence, the answer is \"Anton\". In the second sample, Anton won\n3 games and Danik won 4 games, so the answer is \"Danik\". In the third sample,\nboth Anton and Danik won 3 games and the answer is \"Friendship\".\n\n",
