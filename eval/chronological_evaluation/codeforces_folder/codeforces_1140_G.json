        "description": "You are given a special undirected graph. It consists of \n    2n\n vertices\nnumbered from \n    1\n to \n    2n\n. The following properties hold for the\ngraph: there are exactly \n    3n-2\n edges in the graph: \n    n\n edges connect\nvertices having odd numbers with vertices having even numbers, \n    n - 1\n\nedges connect vertices having odd numbers with each other, and \n    n - 1\n\nedges connect vertices having even numbers with each other; for each edge\n\n    (u, v)\n between a pair of vertices with odd numbers, there exists an edge\n\n    (u + 1, v + 1)\n, and vice versa; for each odd number \n    u \n    \u2208 [1, 2n -\n    1]\n, there exists an edge \n    (u, u + 1)\n; the graph is connected;\nmoreover, if we delete all vertices with even numbers from it, and all edges\nincident to them, the graph will become a tree (the same applies to deleting\nodd vertices).So, the graph can be represented as two trees having the same\nstructure, and \n    n\n edges connecting each vertex of the first tree to the\ncorresponding vertex of the second tree. Edges of the graph are weighted. The\nlength of some simple path in the graph is the sum of weights of traversed\nedges. You are given \n    q\n queries to this graph; in each query, you are\nasked to compute the length of the shortest path between some pair of vertices\nin this graph. Can you answer all of the queries? Input The first line of the\ninput contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    w_1, 2\n, \n    w_3,4\n, ...,\n\n    w_2n - 1, 2n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 w_i, i + 1\n    \u2264 10^12\n). These\nintegers describe the weights of the edges connecting odd vertices with even\nones. Then \n    n-1\n lines follow. \n    i\n-th line contains four integers\n\n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n, \n    w_i, 1\n and \n    w_i, 2\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i, y_i\n    \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    x_i \n     y_i\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 w_i, j\n    \u2264 10^12\n); it\ndescribes two edges: one connecting \n    2x_i - 1\n with \n    2y_i - 1\n and\nhaving weight \n    w_i, 1\n; another connecting \n    2x_i\n with \n    2y_i\n\nand having weight \n    w_i, 2\n. The next line contains one integer \n    q\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 6 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of queries. Then \n    q\n\nlines follow, \n    i\n-th line contains two integers \n    u_i\n and \n    v_i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 2n\n, \n    u_i \n     v_i\n), describing a query\n\"compute the length of the shortest path between vertices \n    u_i\n and\n\n    v_i\n\". Output Print \n    q\n integers, \n    i\n-th integer should be equal\nto the answer to the \n    i\n-th query.
