        "description": "Monocarp is a little boy who lives in Byteland and he loves programming.\nRecently, he found a permutation of length \n    n\n. He has to come up with a\nmystic permutation. It has to be a new permutation such that it differs from\nthe old one in each position. More formally, if the old permutation is\n\n    p_1,p_2,\n    \u2026,p_n\n and the new one is \n    q_1,q_2,\n    \u2026,q_n\n it\nmust hold that \n    \n\n    p_1\n    \u2260 q_1, p_2\n    \u2260 q_2, \n    \u2026 ,p_n\n    \u2260\n    q_n.\n\n    \n Monocarp is afraid of lexicographically large permutations. Can you\nplease help him to find the lexicographically minimal mystic permutation?\nInput There are several test cases in the input data. The first line contains\na single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. This is followed by the test cases description. The first line of each\ntest case contains a positive integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014\nthe length of the permutation. The second line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n distinct positive integers \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    p_i \n    \u2264 n\n). It's guaranteed that \n    p\n is a permutation, i. e. \n    p_i\n    \n    \u2260 p_j\n for all \n    i \n    \u2260 j\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n does not exceed \n    1000\n over all test cases. Output For each test\ncase, output \n    n\n positive integers \u2014 the lexicographically minimal mystic\npermutations. If such a permutation does not exist, output \n    -1\n instead.\nExample Input 4 3 1 2 3 5 2 3 4 5 1 4 2 3 1 4 1 1 Output 2 3 1 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 4\n3 -1 Note In the first test case possible permutations that are mystic are\n\n    [2,3,1]\n and \n    [3,1,2]\n. Lexicographically smaller of the two is\n\n    [2,3,1]\n. In the second test case, \n    [1,2,3,4,5]\n is the\nlexicographically minimal permutation and it is also mystic. In third test\ncase possible mystic permutations are \n    [1,2,4,3]\n, \n    [1,4,2,3]\n,\n\n    [1,4,3,2]\n, \n    [3,1,4,2]\n, \n    [3,2,4,1]\n, \n    [3,4,2,1]\n,\n\n    [4,1,2,3]\n, \n    [4,1,3,2]\n and \n    [4,3,2,1]\n. The smallest one is\n\n    [1,2,4,3]\n.\n\n",
