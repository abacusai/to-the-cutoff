        "description": "As we all know Barney's job is \"PLEASE\" and he has not much to do at work.\nThat's why he started playing \"cups and key\". In this game there are three\nidentical cups arranged in a line from left to right. Initially key to\nBarney's heart is under the middle cup. Then at one turn Barney swaps the cup\nin the middle with any of other two cups randomly (he choses each with equal\nprobability), so the chosen cup becomes the middle one. Game lasts n turns and\nBarney independently choses a cup to swap with the middle one within each\nturn, and the key always remains in the cup it was at the start. After n-th\nturn Barney asks a girl to guess which cup contains the key. The girl points\nto the middle one but Barney was distracted while making turns and doesn't\nknow if the key is under the middle cup. That's why he asked you to tell him\nthe probability that girl guessed right. Number n of game turns can be\nextremely large, that's why Barney did not give it to you. Instead he gave you\nan array a1, a2, ..., ak such that in other words, n is multiplication of all\nelements of the given array. Because of precision difficulties, Barney asked\nyou to tell him the answer as an irreducible fraction. In other words you need\nto find it as a fraction p / q such that , where is the greatest common\ndivisor. Since p and q can be extremely large, you only need to find the\nremainders of dividing each of them by 10^9 + 7. Please note that we want of p\nand q to be 1, not of their remainders after dividing by 10^9 + 7. Input The\nfirst line of input contains a single integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of\nelements in array Barney gave you. The second line contains k integers a1, a2,\n..., ak (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^18) \u2014 the elements of the array. Output In the only line\nof output print a single string x / y where x is the remainder of dividing p\nby 10^9 + 7 and y is the remainder of dividing q by 10^9 + 7. Examples Input 1\n2 Output 1/2 Input 3 1 1 1 Output 0/1\n\n",
