        "description": "Life is not easy for the perfectly common variable named Vasya. Wherever it\ngoes, it is either assigned a value, or simply ignored, or is being used!\nVasya's life goes in states of a program. In each state, Vasya can either be\nused (for example, to calculate the value of another variable), or be assigned\na value, or ignored. Between some states are directed (oriented) transitions.\nA path is a sequence of states v1, v2, ..., vx, where for any 1 \u2264 i < x exists\na transition from vi to vi + 1. Vasya's value in state v is interesting to the\nworld, if exists path p1, p2, ..., pk such, that pi = v for some i (1 \u2264 i \u2264\nk), in state p1 Vasya gets assigned a value, in state pk Vasya is used and\nthere is no state pi (except for p1) where Vasya gets assigned a value. Help\nVasya, find the states in which Vasya's value is interesting to the world.\nInput The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264\n10^5) \u2014 the numbers of states and transitions, correspondingly. The second\nline contains space-separated n integers f1, f2, ..., fn (0 \u2264 fi \u2264 2), fi\ndescribed actions performed upon Vasya in state i: 0 represents ignoring, 1 \u2014\nassigning a value, 2 \u2014 using. Next m lines contain space-separated pairs of\nintegers ai, bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 n, ai \u2260 bi), each pair represents the transition\nfrom the state number ai to the state number bi. Between two states can be any\nnumber of transitions. Output Print n integers r1, r2, ..., rn, separated by\nspaces or new lines. Number ri should equal 1, if Vasya's value in state i is\ninteresting to the world and otherwise, it should equal 0. The states are\nnumbered from 1 to n in the order, in which they are described in the input.\nExamples Input 4 3 1 0 0 2 1 2 2 3 3 4 Output 1 1 1 1 Input 3 1 1 0 2 1 3\nOutput 1 0 1 Input 3 1 2 0 1 1 3 Output 0 0 0 Note In the first sample the\nprogram states can be used to make the only path in which the value of Vasya\ninterests the world, 1 2 3 4; it includes all the states, so in all of them\nVasya's value is interesting to the world. The second sample the only path in\nwhich Vasya's value is interesting to the world is , \u2014 1 3; state 2 is not\nincluded there. In the third sample we cannot make from the states any path in\nwhich the value of Vasya would be interesting to the world, so the value of\nVasya is never interesting to the world.\n\n",
