        "description": "Katie, Kuro and Shiro are best friends. They have known each other since\nkindergarten. That's why they often share everything with each other and work\ntogether on some very hard problems. Today is Shiro's birthday. She really\nloves pizza so she wants to invite her friends to the pizza restaurant near\nher house to celebrate her birthday, including her best friends Katie and\nKuro. She has ordered a very big round pizza, in order to serve her many\nfriends. Exactly \n    n\n of Shiro's friends are here. That's why she has to\ndivide the pizza into \n    n + 1\n slices (Shiro also needs to eat). She wants\nthe slices to be exactly the same size and shape. If not, some of her friends\nwill get mad and go home early, and the party will be over. Shiro is now\nhungry. She wants to cut the pizza with minimum of straight cuts. A cut is a\nstraight segment, it might have ends inside or outside the pizza. But she is\ntoo lazy to pick up the calculator. As usual, she will ask Katie and Kuro for\nhelp. But they haven't come yet. Could you help Shiro with this problem? Input\nA single line contains one non-negative integer \n    n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^18\n) \u2014 the number of Shiro's friends. The circular pizza has to be\nsliced into \n    n + 1\n pieces. Output A single integer \u2014 the number of\nstraight cuts Shiro needs. Examples Input 3 Output 2 Input 4 Output 5 Note To\ncut the round pizza into quarters one has to make two cuts through the center\nwith angle \n    90^\n    \u2218\n between them. To cut the round pizza into five\nequal parts one has to make five cuts.\n\n",
