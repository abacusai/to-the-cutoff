        "description": "Three years have passes and nothing changed. It is still raining in London,\nand Mr. Black has to close all the doors in his home in order to not be\nflooded. Once, however, Mr. Black became so nervous that he opened one door,\nthen another, then one more and so on until he opened all the doors in his\nhouse. There are exactly two exits from Mr. Black's house, let's name them\nleft and right exits. There are several doors in each of the exits, so each\ndoor in Mr. Black's house is located either in the left or in the right exit.\nYou know where each door is located. Initially all the doors are closed. Mr.\nBlack can exit the house if and only if all doors in at least one of the exits\nis open. You are given a sequence in which Mr. Black opened the doors, please\nfind the smallest index \n    k\n such that Mr. Black can exit the house after\nopening the first \n    k\n doors. We have to note that Mr. Black opened each\ndoor at most once, and in the end all doors became open. Input The first line\ncontains integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 200\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of\ndoors. The next line contains \n    n\n integers: the sequence in which Mr.\nBlack opened the doors. The \n    i\n-th of these integers is equal to \n    0\n\nin case the \n    i\n-th opened door is located in the left exit, and it is\nequal to \n    1\n in case it is in the right exit. It is guaranteed that there\nis at least one door located in the left exit and there is at least one door\nlocated in the right exit. Output Print the smallest integer \n    k\n such that\nafter Mr. Black opened the first \n    k\n doors, he was able to exit the house.\nExamples Input 5 0 0 1 0 0 Output 3 Input 4 1 0 0 1 Output 3 Note In the first\nexample the first two doors are from the left exit, so when Mr. Black opened\nboth of them only, there were two more closed door in the left exit and one\nclosed door in the right exit. So Mr. Black wasn't able to exit at that\nmoment. When he opened the third door, all doors from the right exit became\nopen, so Mr. Black was able to exit the house. In the second example when the\nfirst two doors were opened, there was open closed door in each of the exit.\nWith three doors opened Mr. Black was able to use the left exit.\n\n",
