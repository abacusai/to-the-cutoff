        "description": "You have a string \n    s_1 s_2 \n    \u2026 s_n\n and you stand on the left of the\nstring looking right. You want to choose an index \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264\n    n\n) and place a mirror after the \n    k\n-th letter, so that what you see is\n\n    s_1 s_2 \n    \u2026 s_k s_k s_k - 1\n    \u2026 s_1\n. What is the\nlexicographically smallest string you can see? A string \n    a\n is\nlexicographically smaller than a string \n    b\n if and only if one of the\nfollowing holds: \n    a\n is a prefix of \n    b\n, but \n    a \n     b\n; in the\nfirst position where \n    a\n and \n    b\n differ, the string \n    a\n has a\nletter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in\n\n    b\n. Input The first line of input contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n): the number of test cases. The next \n    t\n\nlines contain the description of the test cases, two lines per a test case. In\nthe first line you are given one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n): the length of the string. The second line contains the string\n\n    s\n consisting of \n    n\n lowercase English characters. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output\nFor each test case print the lexicographically smallest string you can see.\nExample Input 4 10 codeforces 9 cbacbacba 3 aaa 4 bbaa Output cc cbaabc aa bb\nNote In the first test case choose \n    k = 1\n to obtain \"cc\". In the second\ntest case choose \n    k = 3\n to obtain \"cbaabc\". In the third test case choose\n\n    k = 1\n to obtain \"aa\". In the fourth test case choose \n    k = 1\n to\nobtain \"bb\".\n\n",
