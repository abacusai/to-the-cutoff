        "name": "Running Track",
        "description": "A boy named Ayrat lives on planet AMI-1511. Each inhabitant of this planet has\na talent. Specifically, Ayrat loves running, moreover, just running is not\nenough for him. He is dreaming of making running a real art. First, he wants\nto construct the running track with coating t. On planet AMI-1511 the coating\nof the track is the sequence of colored blocks, where each block is denoted as\nthe small English letter. Therefore, every coating can be treated as a string.\nUnfortunately, blocks aren't freely sold to non-business customers, but Ayrat\nfound an infinite number of coatings s. Also, he has scissors and glue. Ayrat\nis going to buy some coatings s, then cut out from each of them exactly one\ncontinuous piece (substring) and glue it to the end of his track coating.\nMoreover, he may choose to flip this block before glueing it. Ayrat want's to\nknow the minimum number of coating s he needs to buy in order to get the\ncoating t for his running track. Of course, he also want's to know some way to\nachieve the answer. Input First line of the input contains the string s \u2014 the\ncoating that is present in the shop. Second line contains the string t \u2014 the\ncoating Ayrat wants to obtain. Both strings are non-empty, consist of only\nsmall English letters and their length doesn't exceed 2100. Output The first\nline should contain the minimum needed number of coatings n or -1 if it's\nimpossible to create the desired coating. If the answer is not -1, then the\nfollowing n lines should contain two integers xi and yi \u2014 numbers of ending\nblocks in the corresponding piece. If xi \u2264 yi then this piece is used in the\nregular order, and if xi > yi piece is used in the reversed order. Print the\npieces in the order they should be glued to get the string t. Examples Input\nabc cbaabc Output 2 3 1 1 3 Input aaabrytaaa ayrat Output 3 1 1 6 5 8 7 Input\nami no Output -1 Note In the first sample string \"cbaabc\" = \"cba\" + \"abc\". In\nthe second sample: \"ayrat\" = \"a\" + \"yr\" + \"at\".\n\n",
