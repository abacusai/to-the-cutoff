        "description": "Valentin participates in a show called \"Shockers\". The rules are quite easy:\njury selects one letter which Valentin doesn't know. He should make a small\nspeech, but every time he pronounces a word that contains the selected letter,\nhe receives an electric shock. He can make guesses which letter is selected,\nbut for each incorrect guess he receives an electric shock too. The show ends\nwhen Valentin guesses the selected letter correctly. Valentin can't keep in\nmind everything, so he could guess the selected letter much later than it can\nbe uniquely determined and get excessive electric shocks. Excessive electric\nshocks are those which Valentin got after the moment the selected letter can\nbe uniquely determined. You should find out the number of excessive electric\nshocks. Input The first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the\nnumber of actions Valentin did. The next n lines contain descriptions of his\nactions, each line contains description of one action. Each action can be of\none of three types: Valentin pronounced some word and didn't get an electric\nshock. This action is described by the string \". w\" (without quotes), in which\n\".\" is a dot (ASCII-code 46), and w is the word that Valentin said. Valentin\npronounced some word and got an electric shock. This action is described by\nthe string \"! w\" (without quotes), in which \"!\" is an exclamation mark (ASCII-\ncode 33), and w is the word that Valentin said. Valentin made a guess about\nthe selected letter. This action is described by the string \"? s\" (without\nquotes), in which \"?\" is a question mark (ASCII-code 63), and s is the guess \u2014\na lowercase English letter. All words consist only of lowercase English\nletters. The total length of all words does not exceed 10^5. It is guaranteed\nthat last action is a guess about the selected letter. Also, it is guaranteed\nthat Valentin didn't make correct guesses about the selected letter before the\nlast action. Moreover, it's guaranteed that if Valentin got an electric shock\nafter pronouncing some word, then it contains the selected letter; and also if\nValentin didn't get an electric shock after pronouncing some word, then it\ndoes not contain the selected letter. Output Output a single integer \u2014 the\nnumber of electric shocks that Valentin could have avoided if he had told the\nselected letter just after it became uniquely determined. Examples Input 5 !\nabc . ad . b ! cd ? c Output 1 Input 8 ! hello ! codeforces ? c . o ? d ? h .\nl ? e Output 2 Input 7 ! ababahalamaha ? a ? b ? a ? b ? a ? h Output 0 Note\nIn the first test case after the first action it becomes clear that the\nselected letter is one of the following: a, b, c. After the second action we\ncan note that the selected letter is not a. Valentin tells word \"b\" and\ndoesn't get a shock. After that it is clear that the selected letter is c, but\nValentin pronounces the word cd and gets an excessive electric shock. In the\nsecond test case after the first two electric shocks we understand that the\nselected letter is e or o. Valentin tries some words consisting of these\nletters and after the second word it's clear that the selected letter is e,\nbut Valentin makes 3 more actions before he makes a correct hypothesis. In the\nthird example the selected letter can be uniquely determined only when\nValentin guesses it, so he didn't get excessive electric shocks.\n\n",
