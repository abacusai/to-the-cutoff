        "name": "Wall Bars",
        "description": "Manao is working for a construction company. Recently, an order came to build\nwall bars in a children's park. Manao was commissioned to develop a plan of\nconstruction, which will enable the company to save the most money. After\nreviewing the formal specifications for the wall bars, Manao discovered a\nnumber of controversial requirements and decided to treat them to the\ncompany's advantage. His resulting design can be described as follows: Let's\nintroduce some unit of length. The construction center is a pole of height n.\nAt heights 1, 2, ..., n exactly one horizontal bar sticks out from the pole.\nEach bar sticks in one of four pre-fixed directions. A child can move from one\nbar to another if the distance between them does not exceed h and they stick\nin the same direction. If a child is on the ground, he can climb onto any of\nthe bars at height between 1 and h. In Manao's construction a child should be\nable to reach at least one of the bars at heights n - h + 1, n - h + 2, ..., n\nif he begins at the ground. The figure to the left shows what a common set of\nwall bars looks like. The figure to the right shows Manao's construction Manao\nis wondering how many distinct construction designs that satisfy his\nrequirements exist. As this number can be rather large, print the remainder\nafter dividing it by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9). Two designs are considered\ndistinct if there is such height i, that the bars on the height i in these\ndesigns don't stick out in the same direction. Input A single line contains\ntwo space-separated integers, n and h (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 h \u2264 min(n, 30)).\nOutput In a single line print the remainder after dividing the number of\ndesigns by 1000000009 (10^9 + 9). Examples Input 5 1 Output 4 Input 4 2 Output\n148 Input 4 3 Output 256 Input 5 2 Output 376 Note Consider several designs\nfor h = 2. A design with the first bar sticked out in direction d1, the second\n\u2014 in direction d2 and so on (1 \u2264 di \u2264 4) is denoted as string d1d2...dn.\nDesign \"1231\" (the first three bars are sticked out in different directions,\nthe last one \u2014 in the same as first). A child can reach neither the bar at\nheight 3 nor the bar at height 4. Design \"414141\". A child can reach the bar\nat height 5. To do this, he should first climb at the first bar, then at the\nthird and then at the fifth one. He can also reach bar at height 6 by the\nroute second \u2192 fourth \u2192 sixth bars. Design \"123333\". The child can't reach the\nupper two bars. Design \"323323\". The bar at height 6 can be reached by the\nfollowing route: first \u2192 third \u2192 fourth \u2192 sixth bars.\n\n",
