        "name": "Divide The Students",
        "description": "A group of students has recently been admitted to the Faculty of Computer\nSciences at the Berland State University. Now the programming teacher wants to\ndivide them into three subgroups for practice sessions. The teacher knows that\na lot of programmers argue which language is the best. The teacher doesn't\nwant to hear any arguments in the subgroups, so she wants to divide the\nstudents into three subgroups so that no pair of students belonging to the\nsame subgroup want to argue. To perform this division, the teacher asked each\nstudent which programming language he likes. There are \n    a\n students who\nanswered that they enjoy Assembler, \n    b\n students stated that their\nfavourite language is Basic, and \n    c\n remaining students claimed that C++\nis the best programming language \u2014 and there was a large argument between\nAssembler fans and C++ fans. Now, knowing that Assembler programmers and C++\nprogrammers can start an argument every minute, the teacher wants to divide\nthe students into three subgroups so that every student belongs to exactly one\nsubgroup, and there is no subgroup that contains at least one Assembler fan\nand at least one C++ fan. Since teaching a lot of students can be difficult,\nthe teacher wants the size of the largest subgroup to be minimum possible.\nPlease help the teacher to calculate the minimum possible size of the largest\nsubgroup! Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then test cases follow.\nEach test case consists of one line containing three integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n\nand \n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b, c \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of Assembler fans,\nBasic fans and C++ fans, respectively. Output For each test case print one\ninteger \u2014 the minimum size of the largest subgroup if the students are divided\nin such a way that there is no subgroup that contains at least one Assembler\nfan and at least one C++ fan simultaneously. Examples Input 5 3 5 7 4 8 4 13\n10 13 1000 1000 1000 13 22 7 Output 5 6 13 1000 14 Input 5 1 3 4 1000 1000 1 4\n1 2 325 226 999 939 861 505 Output 3 667 3 517 769 Note Explanation of the\nanswers for the example \n    1\n: The first subgroup contains \n    3\n Assembler\nfans and \n    2\n Basic fans, the second subgroup \u2014 \n    5\n C++ fans, the third\nsubgroup \u2014 \n    2\n C++ fans and \n    3\n Basic fans. The first subgroup\ncontains \n    4\n Assembler fans, the second subgroup \u2014 \n    6\n Basic fans, the\nthird subgroup \u2014 \n    2\n Basic fans and \n    4\n C++ fans. The first subgroup\ncontains all Assembler fans, the second subgroup \u2014 all Basic fans, the third\nsubgroup \u2014 all C++ fans. The first subgroup contains all Assembler fans, the\nsecond subgroup \u2014 all Basic fans, the third subgroup \u2014 all C++ fans. The first\nsubgroup contains \n    12\n Assembler fans and \n    2\n Basic fans, the second\nsubgroup \u2014 \n    1\n Assembler fan and \n    13\n Basic fans, the third subgroup \u2014\n\n    7\n Basic fans and \n    7\n C++ fans.\n\n",
