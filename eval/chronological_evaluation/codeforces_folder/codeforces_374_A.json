        "description": "Dima and Inna are doing so great! At the moment, Inna is sitting on the magic\nlawn playing with a pink pony. Dima wanted to play too. He brought an n \u00d7 m\nchessboard, a very tasty candy and two numbers a and b. Dima put the\nchessboard in front of Inna and placed the candy in position (i, j) on the\nboard. The boy said he would give the candy if it reaches one of the corner\ncells of the board. He's got one more condition. There can only be actions of\nthe following types: move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to\nposition (x - a, y - b); move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to\nposition (x + a, y - b); move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to\nposition (x - a, y + b); move the candy from position (x, y) on the board to\nposition (x + a, y + b). Naturally, Dima doesn't allow to move the candy\nbeyond the chessboard borders. Inna and the pony started shifting the candy\naround the board. They wonder what is the minimum number of allowed actions\nthat they need to perform to move the candy from the initial position (i, j)\nto one of the chessboard corners. Help them cope with the task! Input The\nfirst line of the input contains six integers n, m, i, j, a, b (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264\n10^6; 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m; 1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 10^6). You can assume that the\nchessboard rows are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom and the columns\nare numbered from 1 to m from left to right. Position (i, j) in the statement\nis a chessboard cell on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column.\nYou can consider that the corners are: (1, m), (n, 1), (n, m), (1, 1). Output\nIn a single line print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of moves needed\nto get the candy. If Inna and the pony cannot get the candy playing by Dima's\nrules, print on a single line \"Poor Inna and pony!\" without the quotes.\nExamples Input 5 7 1 3 2 2 Output 2 Input 5 5 2 3 1 1 Output Poor Inna and\npony! Note Note to sample 1: Inna and the pony can move the candy to position\n(1 + 2, 3 + 2) = (3, 5), from there they can move it to positions (3 - 2, 5 +\n2) = (1, 7) and (3 + 2, 5 + 2) = (5, 7). These positions correspond to the\ncorner squares of the chess board. Thus, the answer to the test sample equals\ntwo.\n\n",
