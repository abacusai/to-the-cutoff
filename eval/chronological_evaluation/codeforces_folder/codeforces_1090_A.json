        "name": "Company Merging",
        "description": "A conglomerate consists of \n    n\n companies. To make managing easier, their\nowners have decided to merge all companies into one. By law, it is only\npossible to merge two companies, so the owners plan to select two companies,\nmerge them into one, and continue doing so until there is only one company\nleft. But anti-monopoly service forbids to merge companies if they suspect\nunfriendly absorption. The criterion they use is the difference in maximum\nsalaries between two companies. Merging is allowed only if the maximum\nsalaries are equal. To fulfill the anti-monopoly requirements, the owners can\nchange salaries in their companies before merging. But the labor union insists\non two conditions: it is only allowed to increase salaries, moreover all the\nemployees in one company must get the same increase. Sure enough, the owners\nwant to minimize the total increase of all salaries in all companies. Help\nthem find the minimal possible increase that will allow them to merge\ncompanies into one. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n \u2014\nthe number of companies in the conglomerate (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n). Each of the next \n    n\n lines describes a company. A company\ndescription start with an integer \n    m_i\n \u2014 the number of its employees\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 m_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). Then \n    m_i\n integers follow: the\nsalaries of the employees. All salaries are positive and do not exceed\n\n    10^9\n. The total number of employees in all companies does not exceed\n\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output Output a single integer \u2014 the minimal total\nincrease of all employees that allows to merge all companies. Example Input 3\n2 4 3 2 2 1 3 1 1 1 Output 13 Note One of the optimal merging strategies is\nthe following. First increase all salaries in the second company by \n    2\n,\nand merge the first and the second companies. Now the conglomerate consists of\ntwo companies with salaries \n    [4, 3, 4, 3]\n and \n    [1, 1, 1]\n. To merge\nthem, increase the salaries in the second of those by \n    3\n. The total\nincrease is \n    2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13\n.\n\n",
