        "description": "You are given a graph with \n    3 \n    \u00b7 n\n vertices and \n    m\n edges. You\nare to find a matching of \n    n\n edges, or an independent set of \n    n\n\nvertices. A set of edges is called a matching if no two edges share an\nendpoint. A set of vertices is called an independent set if no two vertices\nare connected with an edge. Input The first line contains a single integer\n\n    T \n    \u2265 1\n \u2014 the number of graphs you need to process. The description of\n\n    T\n graphs follows. The first line of description of a single graph\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n, where \n    3 \n    \u00b7 n\n is the\nnumber of vertices, and \n    m\n is the number of edges in the graph (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). Each of\nthe next \n    m\n lines contains two integers \n    v_i\n and \n    u_i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 v_i, u_i \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 n\n), meaning that there is an edge between\nvertices \n    v_i\n and \n    u_i\n. It is guaranteed that there are no self-\nloops and no multiple edges in the graph. It is guaranteed that the sum of all\n\n    n\n over all graphs in a single test does not exceed \n    10^5\n, and the\nsum of all \n    m\n over all graphs in a single test does not exceed \n    5\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output Print your answer for each of the \n    T\n graphs.\nOutput your answer for a single graph in the following format. If you found a\nmatching of size \n    n\n, on the first line print \"Matching\" (without quotes),\nand on the second line print \n    n\n integers \u2014 the indices of the edges in\nthe matching. The edges are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    m\n in the input\norder. If you found an independent set of size \n    n\n, on the first line\nprint \"IndSet\" (without quotes), and on the second line print \n    n\n integers\n\u2014 the indices of the vertices in the independent set. If there is no matching\nand no independent set of the specified size, print \"Impossible\" (without\nquotes). You can print edges and vertices in any order. If there are several\nsolutions, print any. In particular, if there are both a matching of size\n\n    n\n, and an independent set of size \n    n\n, then you should print exactly\none of such matchings or exactly one of such independent sets. Example Input 4\n1 2 1 3 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 2 2 5 1 2 3 1 1 4 5 1 1 6 2 15 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 2 3 2\n4 2 5 2 6 3 4 3 5 3 6 4 5 4 6 5 6 Output Matching 2 IndSet 1 IndSet 2 4\nMatching 1 15 Note The first two graphs are same, and there are both a\nmatching of size 1 and an independent set of size 1. Any of these matchings\nand independent sets is a correct answer. The third graph does not have a\nmatching of size 2, however, there is an independent set of size 2. Moreover,\nthere is an independent set of size 5: 2 3 4 5 6. However such answer is not\ncorrect, because you are asked to find an independent set (or matching) of\nsize exactly \n    n\n. The fourth graph does not have an independent set of\nsize 2, but there is a matching of size 2.\n\n",
