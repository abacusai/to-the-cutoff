        "description": "Recently Vasya learned that, given two points with different \n    x\n\ncoordinates, you can draw through them exactly one parabola with equation of\ntype \n    y = x^2 + bx + c\n, where \n    b\n and \n    c\n are reals. Let's call\nsuch a parabola an \n    U\n-shaped one. Vasya drew several distinct points with\ninteger coordinates on a plane and then drew an \n    U\n-shaped parabola\nthrough each pair of the points that have different \n    x\n coordinates. The\npicture became somewhat messy, but Vasya still wants to count how many of the\nparabolas drawn don't have any drawn point inside their internal area. Help\nVasya. The internal area of an \n    U\n-shaped parabola is the part of the\nplane that lies strictly above the parabola when the \n    y\n axis is directed\nupwards. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of points. The next \n    n\n lines describe\nthe points, the \n    i\n-th of them contains two integers \n    x_i\n and\n\n    y_i\n \u2014 the coordinates of the \n    i\n-th point. It is guaranteed that all\npoints are distinct and that the coordinates do not exceed \n    10^6\n by\nabsolute value. Output In the only line print a single integer \u2014 the number of\n\n    U\n-shaped parabolas that pass through at least two of the given points\nand do not contain any of the given points inside their internal area\n(excluding the parabola itself). Examples Input 3 -1 0 0 2 1 0 Output 2 Input\n5 1 0 1 -1 0 -1 -1 0 -1 -1 Output 1 Note On the pictures below all\n\n    U\n-shaped parabolas that pass through at least two given points are drawn\nfor each of the examples. The \n    U\n-shaped parabolas that do not have any\ngiven point inside their internal area are drawn in red. The first example.\nThe second example.\n\n",
