        "description": "Sam started playing with round buckets in the sandbox, while also scattering\npebbles. His mom decided to buy him a new bucket, so she needs to solve the\nfollowing task. You are given \n    n\n distinct points with integer coordinates\n\n    A_1, A_2, \n    \u2026, A_n\n. All points were generated from the square\n\n    [-10^8, 10^8] \n    \u00d7 [-10^8, 10^8]\n uniformly and independently. You\nare given positive integers \n    k\n, \n    l\n, such that \n    k \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264\n    n\n. You want to select a subsegment \n    A_i, A_i+1, \n    \u2026, A_i+l-1\n\nof the points array (for some \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n + 1 - l\n), and some\ncircle on the plane, containing \n    \u2265 k\n points of the selected\nsubsegment (inside or on the border). What is the smallest possible radius of\nthat circle? Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow. The first line of each test\ncase contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    l\n, \n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 l\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n     000\n, \n    k \n    \u2264 20\n). Each of the next \n    n\n\nlines contains two integers \n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n (\n    -10^8 \n    \u2264 x_i, y_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^8\n) \u2014 the coordinates of the point \n    A_i\n. It is guaranteed\nthat all points are distinct and were generated independently from uniform\ndistribution on \n    [-10^8, 10^8] \n    \u00d7 [-10^8, 10^8]\n. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n for all test cases does not exceed \n    50\n     000\n. In\nthe first test, points were not generated from the uniform distribution on\n\n    [-10^8, 10^8] \n    \u00d7 [-10^8, 10^8]\n for simplicity. It is the only such\ntest and your solution must pass it. Hacks are disabled in this problem.\nOutput For each test case print a single real number \u2014 the answer to the\nproblem. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative\nerror does not exceed \n    10^-9\n. Formally let your answer be \n    a\n, jury\nanswer be \n    b\n. Your answer will be considered correct if \n    |a -\n    b|/\n    max(1, |b|)\n    \u2264 10^-9\n.

In the second test case, we can select subsegment \n    A_1, A_2,\n    A_3, A_4\n and a circle with center \n    (1, 2)\n and radius \n    1\n.\n\n",
