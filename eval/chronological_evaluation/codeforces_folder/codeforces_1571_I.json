        "description": "Polycarp plans to undergo a full physical examination at his local clinic.\nThere are \n    n\n doctors, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. The \n    i\n-th\ndoctor takes patients from minute \n    L_i\n to minute \n    R_i\n, so Polycarp\ncan visit him at any minute in this range. It takes each doctor exactly one\nminute to examine Polycarp's health. Polycarp wants to arrive at the clinic at\nsome minute \n    x\n and visit all \n    n\n doctors in some order without\nwaiting or visiting any doctor several times. More formally, he chooses an\ninteger \n    x\n and a permutation \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (a sequence of\n\n    n\n integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n such that each integer appears\nexactly once), then proceeds to visit: doctor \n    p_1\n at minute \n    x\n;\ndoctor \n    p_2\n at minute \n    x+1\n; ... doctor \n    p_n\n at minute\n\n    x+n-1\n. The \n    p_i\n-th doctor should be able to take patients at minute\n\n    x+i-1\n, so the following should hold: \n    L[p_i] \n    \u2264 x + i - 1 \n    \u2264\n    R[p_i]\n. Determine if it's possible for Polycarp to choose such a minute\n\n    x\n and a permutation \n    p\n that he'll be able to visit all \n    n\n\ndoctors in without waiting or visiting any doctor several times. If there are\nmultiple answers, print any of them. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. Then\nthe descriptions of \n    t\n testcases follow. The first line of the testcase\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\ndoctors. The second line of the testcase contains \n    n\n integers \n    L_1,\n    L_2, \n    \u2026 L_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 L_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). The third line of the\ntestcase contains \n    n\n integers \n    R_1, R_2, \n    \u2026 R_n\n (\n    L_i \n    \u2264\n    R_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). The sum of \n    n\n over all testcases doesn't exceed\n\n    10^5\n. Output For each testcase print an answer. If there exists such a\nminute \n    x\n and a permutation \n    p\n that Polycarp is able to visit all\n\n    n\n doctors without waiting or visiting any doctor several times, then\nprint \n    x\n in the first line and a permutation \n    p\n in the second line.\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them. Otherwise, print \n    -1\n in\nthe only line. Example Input 5 3 2 3 1 3 3 2 8 6 6 5 4 9 4 3 6 7 6 10 6 9 6 6\n8 2 4 2 4 2 3 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 5 10 Output 1 3 1 2 3 7 4 6 2 1 8 5 3 -1 -1 7 1\nNote In the third testcase it's impossible to visit all doctors, because\nPolycarp has to visit doctor \n    2\n at minute \n    2\n and doctor \n    1\n at\nminute \n    4\n. However, that would require him to wait a minute between the\nvisits, which is not allowed. In the fourth testcase all doctors take patients\nin the span of \n    2\n minutes. However, since there are three of them,\nPolycarp can't visit them all.\n\n",
