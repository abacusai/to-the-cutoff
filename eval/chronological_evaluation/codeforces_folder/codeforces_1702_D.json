        "description": "Let \n    s\n be a string of lowercase Latin letters. Its price is the sum of\nthe indices of letters (an integer between 1 and 26) that are included in it.\nFor example, the price of the string abca is \n    1+2+3+1=7\n. The string\n\n    w\n and the integer \n    p\n are given. Remove the minimal number of\nletters from \n    w\n so that its price becomes less than or equal to \n    p\n\nand print the resulting string. Note that the resulting string may be empty.\nYou can delete arbitrary letters, they do not have to go in a row. If the\nprice of a given string \n    w\n is less than or equal to \n    p\n, then nothing\nneeds to be deleted and \n    w\n must be output. Note that when you delete a\nletter from \n    w\n, the order of the remaining letters is preserved. For\nexample, if you delete the letter e from the string test, you get tst. Input\nThe first line of input contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test. The following are\ndescriptions of \n    t\n test cases. Each case consists of two lines. The first\nof them is the string \n    w\n, it is non-empty and consists of lowercase Latin\nletters. Its length does not exceed \n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. The second line\ncontains an integer \n    p\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p \n    \u2264 5\n     200\n     000\n). It is\nguaranteed that the sum of string lengths \n    w\n over all test cases does not\nexceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output Output exactly \n    t\n rows, the\n\n    i\n-th of them should contain the answer to the \n    i\n-th set of input\ndata. Print the longest string that is obtained from \n    w\n by deleting\nletters such that its price is less or equal to \n    p\n. If there are several\nanswers, then output any of them. Note that the empty string \u2014 is one of the\npossible answers. In this case, just output an empty string. Example Input 5\nabca 2 abca 6 codeforces 1 codeforces 10 codeforces 100 Output aa abc cdc\ncodeforces\n\n",
