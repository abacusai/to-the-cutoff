        "description": "A Russian space traveller Alisa Selezneva, like any other schoolgirl of the\nlate 21 century, is interested in science. She has recently visited the MIT\n(Moscow Institute of Time), where its chairman and the co-inventor of the time\nmachine academician Petrov told her about the construction of a time machine.\nDuring the demonstration of the time machine performance Alisa noticed that\nthe machine does not have high speed and the girl got interested in the reason\nfor such disadvantage. As it turns out on closer examination, one of the\nproblems that should be solved for the time machine isn't solved by an optimal\nalgorithm. If you find a way to solve this problem optimally, the time machine\nwill run faster and use less energy. A task that none of the staff can solve\noptimally is as follows. There exists a matrix a, which is filled by the\nfollowing rule: The cells are consecutive positive integers, starting with\none. Besides, ai, j < at, k (i, j, t, k \u2265 1), if: max(i, j) < max(t, k);\nmax(i, j) = max(t, k) and j < k; max(i, j) = max(t, k), j = k and i > t. So,\nafter the first 36 numbers are inserted, matrix a will look as follows: To\nsolve the problem, you should learn to find rather quickly for the given\nvalues of x1, y1, x2 and y2 (x1 \u2264 x2, y1 \u2264 y2) the meaning of expression: As\nthe meaning of this expression can be large enough, it is sufficient to know\nonly the last 10 digits of the sought value. So, no one in MTI can solve the\ngiven task. Alice was brave enough to use the time machine and travel the past\nto help you. Your task is to write a program that uses the given values x1,\ny1, x2 and y2 finds the last 10 digits of the given expression. Input The\nfirst input line contains a single integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of\ntest sets for which you should solve the problem. Each of the next t lines\ncontains the description of a test \u2014 four positive integers x1, y1, x2 and y2\n(1 \u2264 x1 \u2264 x2 \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 y1 \u2264 y2 \u2264 10^9), separated by spaces. Output For each\nquery print the meaning of the expression if it contains at most 10\ncharacters. Otherwise, print three characters \".\" (without the quotes), and\nthen ten last digits of the time expression. Print the answer to each query on\na single line. Follow the format, given in the sample as closely as possible.\nExamples Input 5 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 2 3 5 6 100 87 288 2002 4 2 5 4 Output 1 24\n300 ...5679392764 111\n\n",
