        "description": "Genie is taking part in an intellectual game. The game consists of \n    n\n\nquestions, and there are \n    m\n participants numbered from \n    1\n to\n\n    m\n. Genie is the participant number \n    1\n. For each question \n    i\n\nand participant \n    j\n, it is known whether the participant will answer the\nquestion correctly or not. The goal of the game is to be the last participant\nstaying in the game. The game is conducted as follows. First, all \n    n\n\nquestions get shuffled uniformly at random (all \n    n!\n permutations are\nequally likely). Then, the questions are asked one by one. Each participant\nanswers the question. If all participants still in the game answer the\nquestion correctly, or if all of them answer the question incorrectly, nothing\nhappens. Otherwise, those participants who answer the question incorrectly\nlose and leave the game. After all \n    n\n questions are asked, all\nparticipants who are still in the game are declared to be the winners. What is\nthe probability that Genie will win the game? Input The first line contains\ntwo integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n \u2014 the number of questions and the number of\nparticipants (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    2 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 17\n).\nThe \n    i\n-th of the next \n    n\n lines contains \n    m\n characters \n    s_i,\n    1, s_i, 2, \n    \u2026, s_i, m\n. Character \n    s_i, j\n is '1' if\nparticipant \n    j\n answers question \n    i\n correctly or '0' otherwise.\nOutput Print the probability that Genie will win the game. Your answer will be\nconsidered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed\n\n    10^-9\n. Examples Input 1 5 11010 Output 1.0000000000000000 Input 3 3\n011 101 110 Output 0.3333333333333333 Input 6 4 1011 0110 1111 0110 0000 1101\nOutput 0.1666666666666667 Note In the first example, there is a single\nquestion and Genie will answer it correctly, thus winning the game (along with\nparticipants \n    2\n and \n    4\n). In the second example, one participant will\nleave after the first asked question, and another participant will leave after\nthe second asked question. Each participant will win with probability\n\n    1/3\n.\n\n",
