        "description": "This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is that in this\nversion there are remove queries. Initially you have a set containing one\nelement \u2014 \n    0\n. You need to handle \n    q\n queries of the following types:\n \n    x\n \u2014 add the integer \n    x\n to the set. It is guaranteed that this\ninteger is not contained in the set; - \n    x\n \u2014 remove the integer \n    x\n\nfrom the set. It is guaranteed that this integer is contained in the set; ?\n\n    k\n \u2014 find the \n    k\n    -mex\n of the set. In our problem, we define\nthe \n    k\n    -mex\n of a set of integers as the smallest non-negative\ninteger \n    x\n that is divisible by \n    k\n and which is not contained in the\nset. Input The first line contains an integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of queries. The following \n    q\n lines describe\nthe queries. An addition query of integer \n    x\n is given in the format +\n\n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^18\n). It is guaranteed that \n    x\n is\nnot contained in the set. A remove query of integer \n    x\n is given in the\nformat - \n    x\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^18\n). It is guaranteed that\n\n    x\n is contained in the set. A search query of \n    k\n    -mex\n is\ngiven in the format ? \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^18\n). It is\nguaranteed that there is at least one query of type ?. Output For each query\nof type ? output a single integer \u2014 the \n    k\n    -mex\n of the set.\nExamples Input 18  1  2 ? 1  4 ? 2  6 ? 3  7  8 ? 1 ? 2  5 ? 1\n 1000000000000000000 ? 1000000000000000000 \u00ad 4 ? 1 ? 2 Output 3 6 3 3 10 3\n2000000000000000000 3 4 Input 10  100 ? 100  200 ? 100 \u00ad 100 ? 100  50\n? 50 \u00ad 50 ? 50 Output 200 300 100 100 50 Note In the first example: After the\nfirst and second queries, the set will contain elements \n    0, 1,\n    2\n. The smallest non-negative number that is divisible by \n    1\n and\nis not in the set is \n    3\n. After the fourth query, the set will contain the\nelements \n    0, 1, 2, 4\n. The smallest non-negative number that is\ndivisible by \n    2\n and is not in the set is \n    6\n. In the second example:\nInitially, the set contains only the element \n    0\n. After adding\nan integer \n    100\n the set contains elements \n    0, 100\n.\n\n    100\n    -mex\n of the set is \n    200\n. After adding an integer\n\n    200\n the set contains elements \n    0, 100, 200\n.\n\n    100\n    -mex\n of the set \n    300\n. After removing an integer\n\n    100\n the set contains elements \n    0, 200\n.\n\n    100\n    -mex\n of the set is \n    100\n. After adding an integer\n\n    50\n the set contains elements \n    0, 50, 200\n.\n\n    50\n    -mex\n of the set is \n    100\n. After removing an integer\n\n    50\n the set contains elements \n    0, 200\n.\n\n    100\n    -mex\n of the set is \n    50\n.\n\n",
