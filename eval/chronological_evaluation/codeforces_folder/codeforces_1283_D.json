        "description": "There are \n    n\n Christmas trees on an infinite number line. The \n    i\n-th\ntree grows at the position \n    x_i\n. All \n    x_i\n are guaranteed to be\ndistinct. Each integer point can be either occupied by the Christmas tree, by\nthe human or not occupied at all. Non-integer points cannot be occupied by\nanything. There are \n    m\n people who want to celebrate Christmas. Let\n\n    y_1, y_2, \n    \u2026, y_m\n be the positions of people (note that all values\n\n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n, y_1, y_2, \n    \u2026, y_m\n should be distinct and\nall \n    y_j\n should be integer). You want to find such an arrangement of\npeople that the value\n\n    \u2211\n    _j=1^m\n    min\n    _i=1^n|x_i - y_j|\n is the\nminimum possible (in other words, the sum of distances to the nearest\nChristmas tree for all people should be minimized). In other words, let\n\n    d_j\n be the distance from the \n    j\n-th human to the nearest Christmas\ntree (\n    d_j = \n    min\n    _i=1^n |y_j - x_i|\n). Then you need to\nchoose such positions \n    y_1, y_2, \n    \u2026, y_m\n that\n\n    \u2211\n    _j=1^m d_j\n is the minimum possible. Input The first\nline of the input contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m\n    \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of Christmas trees and the number of\npeople. The second line of the input contains \n    n\n integers \n    x_1, x_2,\n    \n    \u2026, x_n\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), where \n    x_i\n is the\nposition of the \n    i\n-th Christmas tree. It is guaranteed that all \n    x_i\n\nare distinct. Output In the first line print one integer \n    res\n \u2014 the\nminimum possible value of\n\n    \u2211\n    _j=1^m\n    min\n    _i=1^n|x_i - y_j|\n (in other\nwords, the sum of distances to the nearest Christmas tree for all people). In\nthe second line print \n    m\n integers \n    y_1, y_2, \n    \u2026, y_m\n (\n    -2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^9 \n    \u2264 y_j \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^9\n), where \n    y_j\n is the\nposition of the \n    j\n-th human. All \n    y_j\n should be distinct and all\nvalues \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n, y_1, y_2, \n    \u2026, y_m\n should be\ndistinct. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
