        "description": "In some country live wizards. They love to ride trolleybuses. A city in this\ncountry has a trolleybus depot with n trolleybuses. Every day the trolleybuses\nleave the depot, one by one and go to the final station. The final station is\nat a distance of d meters from the depot. We know for the i-th trolleybus that\nit leaves at the moment of time ti seconds, can go at a speed of no greater\nthan vi meters per second, and accelerate with an acceleration no greater than\na meters per second squared. A trolleybus can decelerate as quickly as you\nwant (magic!). It can change its acceleration as fast as you want, as well.\nNote that the maximum acceleration is the same for all trolleys. Despite the\nmagic the trolleys are still powered by an electric circuit and cannot\novertake each other (the wires are to blame, of course). If a trolleybus\ncatches up with another one, they go together one right after the other until\nthey arrive at the final station. Also, the drivers are driving so as to\narrive at the final station as quickly as possible. You, as head of the\ntrolleybuses' fans' club, are to determine for each trolley the minimum time\nby which it can reach the final station. At the time of arrival at the\ndestination station the trolleybus does not necessarily have zero speed. When\na trolley is leaving the depot, its speed is considered equal to zero. From\nthe point of view of physics, the trolleybuses can be considered as material\npoints, and also we should ignore the impact on the speed of a trolley bus by\neverything, except for the acceleration and deceleration provided by the\nengine. Input The first input line contains three space-separated integers n,\na, d (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 a, d \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of trolleybuses, their\nmaximum acceleration and the distance from the depot to the final station,\ncorrespondingly. Next n lines contain pairs of integers ti vi (0 \u2264 t1 < t2...\n< tn - 1 < tn \u2264 10^6, 1 \u2264 vi \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the time when the i-th trolleybus\nleaves the depot and its maximum speed, correspondingly. The numbers in the\nlines are separated by spaces. Output For each trolleybus print a single line\nthe time it arrives to the final station. Print the times for the trolleybuses\nin the order in which the trolleybuses are given in the input. The answer will\nbe accepted if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^-4. Examples\nInput 3 10 10000 0 10 5 11 1000 1 Output 1000.5000000000 1000.5000000000\n11000.0500000000 Input 1 2 26 28 29 Output 33.0990195136 Note In the first\nsample the second trolleybus will catch up with the first one, that will\nhappen at distance 510.5 meters from the depot. The trolleybuses will go the\nremaining 9489.5 meters together at speed 10 meters per second. As a result,\nboth trolleybuses will arrive to the final station by the moment of time\n1000.5 seconds. The third trolleybus will not catch up with them. It will\narrive to the final station by the moment of time 11000.05 seconds.\n\n",
