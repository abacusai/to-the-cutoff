        "name": "Prime Problem",
        "description": "In Berland prime numbers are fashionable \u2014 the respectable citizens dwell only\non the floors with numbers that are prime numbers. The numismatists value\nparticularly high the coins with prime nominal values. All the prime days are\nannounced holidays! Yet even this is not enough to make the Berland people\nhappy. On the main street of the capital stand n houses, numbered from 1 to n.\nThe government decided to paint every house a color so that the sum of the\nnumbers of the houses painted every color is a prime number. However it turned\nout that not all the citizens approve of this decision \u2014 many of them protest\nbecause they don't want many colored houses on the capital's main street.\nThat's why it is decided to use the minimal possible number of colors. The\nhouses don't have to be painted consecutively, but every one of n houses\nshould be painted some color. The one-colored houses should not stand\nconsecutively, any way of painting is acceptable. There are no more than 5\nhours left before the start of painting, help the government find the way when\nthe sum of house numbers for every color is a prime number and the number of\nused colors is minimal. Input The single input line contains an integer n (2 \u2264\nn \u2264 6000) \u2014 the number of houses on the main streets of the capital. Output\nPrint the sequence of n numbers, where the i-th number stands for the number\nof color for house number i. Number the colors consecutively starting from 1.\nAny painting order is allowed. If there are several solutions to that problem,\nprint any of them. If there's no such way of painting print the single number\n-1. Examples Input 8 Output 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2\n\n",
