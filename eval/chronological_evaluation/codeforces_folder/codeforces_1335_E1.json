        "name": "Three Blocks Palindrome (easy version)",
        "description": "The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints. You are\ngiven a sequence \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n positive integers. Let's define\na three blocks palindrome as the sequence, consisting of at most two distinct\nelements (let these elements are \n    a\n and \n    b\n, \n    a\n can be equal\n\n    b\n) and is as follows: \n    [\n    a, a, \n    \u2026, a_x,\n    \n    b, b, \n    \u2026, b_y, \n    a, a, \n    \u2026, a_x]\n.\nThere \n    x, y\n are integers greater than or equal to \n    0\n. For example,\nsequences \n    []\n, \n    [2]\n, \n    [1, 1]\n, \n    [1, 2, 1]\n, \n    [1, 2, 2,\n    1]\n and \n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n are three block palindromes but \n    [1, 2, 3,\n    2, 1]\n, \n    [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n and \n    [1, 2]\n are not. Your task is to\nchoose the maximum by length subsequence of \n    a\n that is a three blocks\npalindrome. You have to answer \n    t\n independent test cases. Recall that the\nsequence \n    t\n is a a subsequence of the sequence \n    s\n if \n    t\n can be\nderived from \n    s\n by removing zero or more elements without changing the\norder of the remaining elements. For example, if \n    s=[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2,\n    1]\n, then possible subsequences are: \n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n, \n    [3]\n and\n\n    [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]\n, but not \n    [3, 2, 3]\n and \n    [1, 1, 1, 1,\n    2]\n. Input The first line of the input contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases\nfollow. The first line of the test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2000\n) \u2014 the length of \n    a\n. The second line of the test\ncase contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 26\n), where \n    a_i\n is the \n    i\n-th element of \n    a\n. Note that\nthe maximum value of \n    a_i\n can be up to \n    26\n. It is guaranteed that\nthe sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2000\n (\n    \u2211 n\n    \n    \u2264 2000\n). Output For each test case, print the answer \u2014 the maximum\npossible length of some subsequence of \n    a\n that is a three blocks\npalindrome.
