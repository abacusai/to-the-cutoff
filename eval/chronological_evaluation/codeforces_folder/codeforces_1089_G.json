        "description": "Berland State University invites people from all over the world as guest\nstudents. You can come to the capital of Berland and study with the best\nteachers in the country. Berland State University works every day of the week,\nbut classes for guest students are held on the following schedule. You know\nthe sequence of seven integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_7\n (\n    a_i = 0\n or\n\n    a_i = 1\n): \n    a_1=1\n if and only if there are classes for guest\nstudents on Sundays; \n    a_2=1\n if and only if there are classes for guest\nstudents on Mondays; ... \n    a_7=1\n if and only if there are classes for\nguest students on Saturdays. The classes for guest students are held in at\nleast one day of a week. You want to visit the capital of Berland and spend\nthe minimum number of days in it to study \n    k\n days as a guest student in\nBerland State University. Write a program to find the length of the shortest\ncontinuous period of days to stay in the capital to study exactly \n    k\n days\nas a guest student. Input The first line of the input contains integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases to process. For\neach test case independently solve the problem and print the answer. Each test\ncase consists of two lines. The first of them contains integer \n    k\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^8\n) \u2014 the required number of days to study as a guest\nstudent. The second line contains exactly seven integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_7\n (\n    a_i = 0\n or \n    a_i = 1\n) where \n    a_i=1\n if and only if\nclasses for guest students are held on the \n    i\n-th day of a week. Output\nPrint \n    t\n lines, the \n    i\n-th line should contain the answer for the\n\n    i\n-th test case \u2014 the length of the shortest continuous period of days\nyou need to stay to study exactly \n    k\n days as a guest student. Example\nInput 3 2 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100000000 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 Output 8\n233333332 1 Note In the first test case you must arrive to the capital of\nBerland on Monday, have classes on this day, spend a week until next Monday\nand have classes on the next Monday. In total you need to spend \n    8\n days\nin the capital of Berland.\n\n",
