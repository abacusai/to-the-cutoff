        "description": "Alice and Bob have a rectangular board consisting of \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n\ncolumns. Each row contains exactly one chip. Alice and Bob play the following\ngame. They choose two integers \n    l\n and \n    r\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 l\n    \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 m\n and cut the board in such a way that only the part of it\nbetween column \n    l\n and column \n    r\n (inclusive) remains. So, all columns\nto the left of column \n    l\n and all columns to the right of column \n    r\n\nno longer belong to the board. After cutting the board, they move chips on the\nremaining part of the board (the part from column \n    l\n to column \n    r\n).\nThey make alternating moves, and the player which cannot make a move loses the\ngame. The first move is made by Alice, the second \u2014 by Bob, the third \u2014 by\nAlice, and so on. During their move, the player must choose one of the chips\nfrom the board and move it any positive number of cells to the left (so, if\nthe chip was in column \n    i\n, it can move to any column \n    j < i\n, and the\nchips in the leftmost column cannot be chosen). Alice and Bob have \n    q\n\npairs of numbers \n    L_i\n and \n    R_i\n. For each such pair, they want to\ndetermine who will be the winner of the game if \n    l = L_i\n and \n    r =\n    R_i\n. Note that these games should be considered independently (they don't\naffect the state of the board for the next games), and both Alice and Bob play\noptimally. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of rows and columns on\nthe board, respectively. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    c_1,\n    c_2, \n    \u2026, c_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 m\n), where \n    c_i\n is the index\nof the column where the chip in the \n    i\n-th row is located (so, the chip in\nthe \n    i\n-th row is in the \n    c_i\n-th column). The third line contains one\ninteger \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). Then \n    q\n lines\nfollow, the \n    i\n-th of them contains two integers \n    L_i\n and \n    R_i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 L_i \n    \u2264 R_i \n    \u2264 m\n). Output Print a string of \n    q\n\ncharacters. The \n    i\n-th character should be A if Alice wins the game with\n\n    l = L_i\n and \n    r = R_i\n, or B if Bob wins it.
