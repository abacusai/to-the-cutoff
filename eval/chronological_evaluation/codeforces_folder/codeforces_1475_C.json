        "name": "Ball in Berland",
        "description": "At the school where Vasya is studying, preparations are underway for the\ngraduation ceremony. One of the planned performances is a ball, which will be\nattended by pairs of boys and girls. Each class must present two couples to\nthe ball. In Vasya's class, \n    a\n boys and \n    b\n girls wish to\nparticipate. But not all boys and not all girls are ready to dance in pairs.\nFormally, you know \n    k\n possible one-boy-one-girl pairs. You need to choose\ntwo of these pairs so that no person is in more than one pair. For example, if\n\n    a=3\n, \n    b=4\n, \n    k=4\n and the couples \n    (1, 2)\n, \n    (1, 3)\n,\n\n    (2, 2)\n, \n    (3, 4)\n are ready to dance together (in each pair, the\nboy's number comes first, then the girl's number), then the following\ncombinations of two pairs are possible (not all possible options are listed\nbelow): \n    (1, 3)\n and \n    (2, 2)\n; \n    (3, 4)\n and \n    (1, 3)\n; But the\nfollowing combinations are not possible: \n    (1, 3)\n and \n    (1, 2)\n \u2014 the\nfirst boy enters two pairs; \n    (1, 2)\n and \n    (2, 2)\n \u2014 the second girl\nenters two pairs; Find the number of ways to select two pairs that match the\ncondition above. Two ways are considered different if they consist of\ndifferent pairs. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n and\n\n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b, k \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of boys and\ngirls in the class and the number of couples ready to dance together. The\nsecond line of each test case contains \n    k\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026\n    a_k\n. (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 a\n), where \n    a_i\n is the number of the boy\nin the pair with the number \n    i\n. The third line of each test case contains\n\n    k\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026 b_k\n. (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 b\n),\nwhere \n    b_i\n is the number of the girl in the pair with the number \n    i\n.\nIt is guaranteed that the sums of \n    a\n, \n    b\n, and \n    k\n over all test\ncases do not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. It is guaranteed that each pair is\nspecified at most once in one test case. Output For each test case, on a\nseparate line print one integer \u2014 the number of ways to choose two pairs that\nmatch the condition above. Example Input 3 3 4 4 1 1 2 3 2 3 2 4 1 1 1 1 1 2 2\n4 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 Output 4 0 2 Note In the first test case, the following\ncombinations of pairs fit: \n    (1, 2)\n and \n    (3, 4)\n; \n    (1, 3)\n and\n\n    (2, 2)\n; \n    (1, 3)\n and \n    (3, 4)\n; \n    (2, 2)\n and \n    (3, 4)\n.\nThere is only one pair in the second test case. In the third test case, the\nfollowing combinations of pairs fit: \n    (1, 1)\n and \n    (2, 2)\n; \n    (1,\n    2)\n and \n    (2, 1)\n.\n\n",
