        "description": "Today is tuesday, that means there is a dispute in JOHNNY SOLVING team again:\nthey try to understand who is Johnny and who is Solving. That's why guys asked\nUmnik to help them. Umnik gave guys a connected graph with \n    n\n vertices\nwithout loops and multiedges, such that a degree of any vertex is at least\n\n    3\n, and also he gave a number \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n. Because Johnny\nis not too smart, he promised to find a simple path with length at least\n\n    n/k\n in the graph. In reply, Solving promised to find \n    k\n\nsimple by vertices cycles with representatives, such that: Length of each\ncycle is at least \n    3\n. Length of each cycle is not divisible by \n    3\n.\nIn each cycle must be a representative - vertex, which belongs only to this\ncycle among all printed cycles. You need to help guys resolve the dispute, for\nthat you need to find a solution for Johnny: a simple path with length at\nleast \n    n/k\n (\n    n\n is not necessarily divided by \n    k\n), or\nsolution for Solving: \n    k\n cycles that satisfy all the conditions above. If\nthere is no any solution - print \n    -1\n. Input The first line contains three\nintegers \n    n\n, \n    m\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2.5\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5, 1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) Next \n    m\n lines describe\nedges of the graph in format \n    v\n, \n    u\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 v, u \n    \u2264 n\n).\nIt's guaranteed that \n    v \n    \u2260 u\n and all \n    m\n pairs are distinct. It's\nguaranteed that a degree of each vertex is at least \n    3\n. Output Print PATH\nin the first line, if you solve problem for Johnny. In the second line print\nthe number of vertices in the path \n    c\n (\n    c \n    \u2265\n    n/k\n). And\nin the third line print vertices describing the path in route order. Print\nCYCLES in the first line, if you solve problem for Solving. In the following\nlines describe exactly \n    k\n cycles in the following format: in the first\nline print the size of the cycle \n    c\n (\n    c \n    \u2265 3\n). In the second\nline print the cycle in route order. Also, the first vertex in the cycle must\nbe a representative. Print \n    -1\n if there is no any solution. The total\namount of printed numbers in the output must be at most \n    10^6\n. It's\nguaranteed, that if exists any solution then there is a correct output\nsatisfies this restriction.
