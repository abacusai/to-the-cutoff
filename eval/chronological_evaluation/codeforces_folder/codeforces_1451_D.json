        "description": "Utkarsh is forced to play yet another one of Ashish's games. The game\nprogresses turn by turn and as usual, Ashish moves first. Consider the 2D\nplane. There is a token which is initially at \n    (0,0)\n. In one move a\nplayer must increase either the \n    x\n coordinate or the \n    y\n coordinate\nof the token by exactly \n    k\n. In doing so, the player must ensure that the\ntoken stays within a (Euclidean) distance \n    d\n from \n    (0,0)\n. In other\nwords, if after a move the coordinates of the token are \n    (p,q)\n, then\n\n    p^2 + q^2 \n    \u2264 d^2\n must hold. The game ends when a player is unable to\nmake a move. It can be shown that the game will end in a finite number of\nmoves. If both players play optimally, determine who will win. Input The first\nline contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. The only line of each test case contains two space\nseparated integers \n    d\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 d \n    \u2264 10^5\n) and \n    k\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 d\n). Output For each test case, if Ashish wins the game,\nprint \"Ashish\", otherwise print \"Utkarsh\" (without the quotes). Example Input\n5 2 1 5 2 10 3 25 4 15441 33 Output Utkarsh Ashish Utkarsh Utkarsh Ashish Note\nIn the first test case, one possible sequence of moves can be \n    (0, 0)\n    \n     (0, 1) \n     (0,\n    2)\n. Ashish has no moves left, so Utkarsh wins.\n\n",
