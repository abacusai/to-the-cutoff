        "description": "In some game by Playrix it takes t minutes for an oven to bake k carrot cakes,\nall cakes are ready at the same moment t minutes after they started baking.\nArkady needs at least n cakes to complete a task, but he currently don't have\nany. However, he has infinitely many ingredients and one oven. Moreover,\nArkady can build one more similar oven to make the process faster, it would\ntake d minutes to build the oven. While the new oven is being built, only old\none can bake cakes, after the new oven is built, both ovens bake\nsimultaneously. Arkady can't build more than one oven. Determine if it is\nreasonable to build the second oven, i.e. will it decrease the minimum time\nneeded to get n cakes or not. If the time needed with the second oven is the\nsame as with one oven, then it is unreasonable. Input The only line contains\nfour integers n, t, k, d (1 \u2264 n, t, k, d \u2264 1 000) \u2014 the number of cakes\nneeded, the time needed for one oven to bake k cakes, the number of cakes\nbaked at the same time, the time needed to build the second oven. Output If it\nis reasonable to build the second oven, print \"YES\". Otherwise print \"NO\".\nExamples Input 8 6 4 5 Output YES Input 8 6 4 6 Output NO Input 10 3 11 4\nOutput NO Input 4 2 1 4 Output YES Note In the first example it is possible to\nget 8 cakes in 12 minutes using one oven. The second oven can be built in 5\nminutes, so after 6 minutes the first oven bakes 4 cakes, the second oven\nbakes 4 more ovens after 11 minutes. Thus, it is reasonable to build the\nsecond oven. In the second example it doesn't matter whether we build the\nsecond oven or not, thus it takes 12 minutes to bake 8 cakes in both cases.\nThus, it is unreasonable to build the second oven. In the third example the\nfirst oven bakes 11 cakes in 3 minutes, that is more than needed 10. It is\nunreasonable to build the second oven, because its building takes more time\nthat baking the needed number of cakes using the only oven.\n\n",
