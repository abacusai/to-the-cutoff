        "description": "On the number line there are \n    m\n points, \n    i\n-th of which has integer\ncoordinate \n    x_i\n and integer weight \n    w_i\n. The coordinates of all\npoints are different, and the points are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    m\n. A\nsequence of \n    n\n segments \n    [l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \n    \u2026, [l_n, r_n]\n\nis called system of nested segments if for each pair \n    i, j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i\n    < j \n    \u2264 n\n) the condition \n    l_i < l_j < r_j < r_i\n is satisfied. In\nother words, the second segment is strictly inside the first one, the third\nsegment is strictly inside the second one, and so on. For a given number\n\n    n\n, find a system of nested segments such that: both ends of each segment\nare one of \n    m\n given points; the sum of the weights \n    2\n    \u00b7 n\n of\nthe points used as ends of the segments is minimal. For example, let \n    m =\n    8\n. The given points are marked in the picture, their weights are marked in\nred, their coordinates are marked in blue. Make a system of three nested\nsegments: weight of the first segment: \n    1 + 1 = 2\n weight of the second\nsegment: \n    10 + (-1) = 9\n weight of the third segment: \n    3 + (-2) = 1\n\nsum of the weights of all the segments in the system: \n    2 + 9 + 1 = 12\n\nSystem of three nested segments Input The first line of input data contains an\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014the number of input test cases.\nAn empty line is written before each test case. The first line of each test\ncase contains two positive integers \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) and\n\n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u00b7 n \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The next \n    m\n\nlines contain pairs of integers \n    x_i\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n)\nand \n    w_i\n (\n    -10^4 \n    \u2264 w_i \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 coordinate and weight of\npoint number \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 m\n) respectively. All \n    x_i\n are\ndifferent. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    m\n values over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, output \n    n +\n    1\n lines: in the first of them, output the weight of the composed system,\nand in the next \n    n\n lines output exactly two numbers \u2014 the indices of the\npoints which are the endpoints of the \n    i\n-th segment (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264\n    n\n). The order in which you output the endpoints of a segment is not\nimportant \u2014 you can output the index of the left endpoint first and then the\nnumber of the right endpoint, or the other way around. If there are several\nways to make a system of nested segments with minimal weight, output any of\nthem. Example Input 3 3 8 0 10 -2 1 4 10 11 20 7 -1 9 1 2 3 5 -2 3 6 -1 2 1 3\n3 -1 2 4 4 0 8 2 2 5 5 -1 3 -2 1 0 -2 0 -5 -3 Output 12 2 6 5 1 7 8 10 1 6 5 2\n3 4 -6 5 1 4 2 Note The first test case coincides with the example from the\ncondition. It can be shown that the weight of the composed system is minimal.\nThe second test case has only \n    6\n points, so you need to use each of them\nto compose \n    3\n segments.\n\n",
