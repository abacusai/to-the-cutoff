        "description": "Tavas is a strange creature. Usually \"zzz\" comes out of people's mouth while\nsleeping, but string s of length n comes out from Tavas' mouth instead. Today\nTavas fell asleep in Malekas' place. While he was sleeping, Malekas did a\nlittle process on s. Malekas has a favorite string p. He determined all\npositions x1 < x2 < ... < xk where p matches s. More formally, for each xi (1\n\u2264 i \u2264 k) he condition sxisxi + 1... sxi + |p| - 1 = p is fullfilled. Then\nMalekas wrote down one of subsequences of x1, x2, ... xk (possibly, he didn't\nwrite anything) on a piece of paper. Here a sequence b is a subsequence of\nsequence a if and only if we can turn a into b by removing some of its\nelements (maybe no one of them or all). After Tavas woke up, Malekas told him\neverything. He couldn't remember string s, but he knew that both p and s only\ncontains lowercase English letters and also he had the subsequence he had\nwritten on that piece of paper. Tavas wonders, what is the number of possible\nvalues of s? He asked SaDDas, but he wasn't smart enough to solve this. So,\nTavas asked you to calculate this number for him. Answer can be very large, so\nTavas wants you to print the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. Input The first line\ncontains two integers n and m, the length of s and the length of the\nsubsequence Malekas wrote down (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6 and 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n - |p| + 1). The\nsecond line contains string p (1 \u2264 |p| \u2264 n). The next line contains m space\nseparated integers y1, y2, ..., ym, Malekas' subsequence (1 \u2264 y1 < y2 < ... <\nym \u2264 n - |p| + 1). Output In a single line print the answer modulo 1000 000\n007. Examples Input 6 2 ioi 1 3 Output 26 Input 5 2 ioi 1 2 Output 0 Note In\nthe first sample test all strings of form \"ioioi?\" where the question mark\nreplaces arbitrary English letter satisfy. Here |x| denotes the length of\nstring x. Please note that it's possible that there is no such string (answer\nis 0).\n\n",
