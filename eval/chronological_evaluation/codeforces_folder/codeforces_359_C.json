        "description": "Simon has a prime number x and an array of non-negative integers a1, a2, ...,\nan. Simon loves fractions very much. Today he wrote out number on a piece of\npaper. After Simon led all fractions to a common denominator and summed them\nup, he got a fraction: , where number t equals x^a1+a2+...+an. Now Simon wants\nto reduce the resulting fraction. Help him, find the greatest common divisor\nof numbers s and t. As GCD can be rather large, print it as a remainder after\ndividing it by number 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Input The first line contains two\npositive integers n and x (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 2 \u2264 x \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the size of the array\nand the prime number. The second line contains n space-separated integers a1,\na2, ..., an (0 \u2264 a1 \u2264 a2 \u2264 ... \u2264 an \u2264 10^9). Output Print a single number \u2014\nthe answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). Examples Input 2 2 2 2\nOutput 8 Input 3 3 1 2 3 Output 27 Input 2 2 29 29 Output 73741817 Input 4 5 0\n0 0 0 Output 1 Note In the first sample . Thus, the answer to the problem is\n8. In the second sample, . The answer to the problem is 27, as 351 = 13\u00b727,\n729 = 27\u00b727. In the third sample the answer to the problem is 1073741824 mod\n1000000007 = 73741817. In the fourth sample . Thus, the answer to the problem\nis 1.\n\n",
