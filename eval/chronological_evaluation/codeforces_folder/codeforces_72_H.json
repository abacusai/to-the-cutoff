        "description": "The 14th of March was the international day of mathematics, because of number\n\u03c0 = 3.1415926... In the occasion of this day Goofy Nephews Unity Organization\n(GNU) wants to publish the fastest program in math at 1:59:26 AM. Now the time\nis 1:11:11 AM and the project team haven't checked their program yet. Because\nof shortage of time they want to check their program with some queries. So\nthey hired Hormizd (one of the greatest programmers in world) to write a\ntester for GNU's new program. Because Hormizd has much more important things\nto do, he wants you to write a small part of tester and it is reversing the\nnumbers. Help him before 1:59:26. We can reverse numbers easily. For example\nby reversing 1234 we get 4321. Note, that if the integer is negative then its\nreverse would be also negative. For example reverse of - 123 is - 321. Also,\nyou have to delete all the leading zeroes before and after the reverse. Given\nan integer you have to help Hormizd reverse it. Input The first line contains\na single integer n. It is less than 10^1000 by it's absolute value. This\ninteger may have leading zeros. If it had leading zeros you should first omit\nthem and print the reverse of remaining digits. It's guaranteed that input\ncontains less than 10001 characters. Output Output a single integer, the\nreverse of the given number. You have to omit leading zeros in the output.\nExamples Input 23 Output 32 Input -032 Output -23 Input 01234560 Output 654321\n\n",
