        "description": "A non-empty digit string is diverse if the number of occurrences of each\ncharacter in it doesn't exceed the number of distinct characters in it. For\nexample: string \"7\" is diverse because 7 appears in it \n    1\n time and the\nnumber of distinct characters in it is \n    1\n; string \"77\" is not diverse\nbecause 7 appears in it \n    2\n times and the number of distinct characters in\nit is \n    1\n; string \"1010\" is diverse because both 0 and 1 appear in it\n\n    2\n times and the number of distinct characters in it is \n    2\n; string\n\"6668\" is not diverse because 6 appears in it \n    3\n times and the number of\ndistinct characters in it is \n    2\n. You are given a string \n    s\n of length\n\n    n\n, consisting of only digits \n    0\n to \n    9\n. Find how many of its\n\n    n(n+1)/2\n substrings are diverse. A string \n    a\n is a\nsubstring of a string \n    b\n if \n    a\n can be obtained from \n    b\n by\ndeletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and\nseveral (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end. Note that if the same\ndiverse string appears in \n    s\n multiple times, each occurrence should be\ncounted independently. For example, there are two diverse substrings in \"77\"\nboth equal to \"7\", so the answer for the string \"77\" is \n    2\n. Input Each\ntest contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first\nline of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the string \n    s\n. The second line of each test case\ncontains a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n. It is guaranteed that all\ncharacters of \n    s\n are digits from \n    0\n to \n    9\n. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output\nFor each test case print one integer \u2014 the number of diverse substrings of the\ngiven string \n    s\n. Example Input 7 1 7 2 77 4 1010 5 01100 6 399996 5 23456\n18 789987887987998798 Output 1 2 10 12 10 15 106 Note In the first test case,\nthe diverse substring is \"7\". In the second test case, the only diverse\nsubstring is \"7\", which appears twice, so the answer is \n    2\n. In the third\ntest case, the diverse substrings are \"0\" (\n    2\n times), \"01\", \"010\", \"1\"\n(\n    2\n times), \"10\" (\n    2\n times), \"101\" and \"1010\". In the fourth test\ncase, the diverse substrings are \"0\" (\n    3\n times), \"01\", \"011\", \"0110\", \"1\"\n(\n    2\n times), \"10\", \"100\", \"110\" and \"1100\". In the fifth test case, the\ndiverse substrings are \"3\", \"39\", \"399\", \"6\", \"9\" (\n    4\n times), \"96\" and\n\"996\". In the sixth test case, all \n    15\n non-empty substrings of \"23456\"\nare diverse.\n\n",
