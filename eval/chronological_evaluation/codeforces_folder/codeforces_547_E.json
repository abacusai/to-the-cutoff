        "description": "What-The-Fatherland is a strange country! All phone numbers there are strings\nconsisting of lowercase English letters. What is double strange that a phone\nnumber can be associated with several bears! In that country there is a rock\nband called CF consisting of n bears (including Mike) numbered from 1 to n.\nPhone number of i-th member of CF is si. May 17th is a holiday named Phone\nCalls day. In the last Phone Calls day, everyone called all the numbers that\nare substrings of his/her number (one may call some number several times). In\nparticular, everyone called himself (that was really strange country). Denote\nas call(i, j) the number of times that i-th member of CF called the j-th\nmember of CF. The geek Mike has q questions that he wants to ask you. In each\nquestion he gives you numbers l, r and k and you should tell him the number\nInput The first line of input contains integers n and q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u00d7 10^5 and\n1 \u2264 q \u2264 5 \u00d7 10^5). The next n lines contain the phone numbers, i-th line\ncontains a string si consisting of lowercase English letters (). The next q\nlines contain the information about the questions, each of them contains\nintegers l, r and k (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n and 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n). Output Print the answer for\neach question in a separate line. Examples Input 5 5 a ab abab ababab b 1 5 1\n3 5 1 1 5 2 1 5 3 1 4 5 Output 7 5 6 3 6\n\n",
