        "description": "Uh oh! Ray lost his array yet again! However, Omkar might be able to help\nbecause he thinks he has found the OmkArray of Ray's array. The OmkArray of an\narray \n    a\n with elements \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_2k-1\n, is the array\n\n    b\n with elements \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_k\n such that \n    b_i\n is\nequal to the median of \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_2i-1\n for all \n    i\n.\nOmkar has found an array \n    b\n of size \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Given this array\n\n    b\n, Ray wants to test Omkar's claim and see if \n    b\n actually is an\nOmkArray of some array \n    a\n. Can you help Ray? The median of a set of\nnumbers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_2i-1\n is the number \n    c_i\n where\n\n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_2i-1\n represents \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_2i-1\n sorted in nondecreasing order. Input Each test contains multiple\ntest cases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the array \n    b\n. The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    -10^9\n    \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the elements of \n    b\n. It is guaranteed the sum\nof \n    n\n across all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output\nFor each test case, output one line containing YES if there exists an array\n\n    a\n such that \n    b_i\n is the median of \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_2i-1\n\nfor all \n    i\n, and NO otherwise. The case of letters in YES and NO do not\nmatter (so yEs and No will also be accepted). Examples Input 5 4 6 2 1 3 1 4 5\n4 -8 5 6 -7 2 3 3 4 2 1 2 3 Output NO YES NO YES YES Input 5 8 -8 2 -6 -5 -4 3\n3 2 7 1 1 3 1 0 -2 -1 7 6 12 8 6 2 6 10 6 5 1 2 3 6 7 5 1 3 4 3 0 Output NO\nYES NO NO NO Note In the second case of the first sample, the array \n    [4]\n\nwill generate an OmkArray of \n    [4]\n, as the median of the first element is\n\n    4\n. In the fourth case of the first sample, the array \n    [3, 2, 5]\n\nwill generate an OmkArray of \n    [3, 3]\n, as the median of \n    3\n is \n    3\n\nand the median of \n    2, 3, 5\n is \n    3\n. In the fifth case of the first\nsample, the array \n    [2, 1, 0, 3, 4, 4, 3]\n will generate an OmkArray of\n\n    [2, 1, 2, 3]\n as the median of \n    2\n is \n    2\n the median of \n    0, 1,\n    2\n is \n    1\n the median of \n    0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n is \n    2\n and the median of\n\n    0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4\n is \n    3\n. In the second case of the second sample,\nthe array \n    [1, 0, 4, 3, 5, -2, -2, -2, -4, -3, -4, -1, 5]\n will generate\nan OmkArray of \n    [1, 1, 3, 1, 0, -2, -1]\n, as the median of \n    1\n is\n\n    1\n the median of \n    0, 1, 4\n is \n    1\n the median of \n    0, 1, 3, 4,\n    5\n is \n    3\n the median of \n    -2, -2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5\n is \n    1\n the\nmedian of \n    -4, -2, -2, -2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5\n is \n    0\n the median of \n    -4,\n    -4, -3, -2, -2, -2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5\n is \n    -2\n and the median of \n    -4, -4,\n    -3, -2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 5\n is \n    -1\n For all cases where the\nanswer is NO, it can be proven that it is impossible to find an array \n    a\n\nsuch that \n    b\n is the OmkArray of \n    a\n.\n\n",
