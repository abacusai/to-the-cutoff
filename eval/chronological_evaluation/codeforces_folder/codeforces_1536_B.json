        "description": "I, Fischl, Prinzessin der Verurteilung, descend upon this land by the call of\nfate an \u2014 Oh, you are also a traveler from another world? Very well, I grant\nyou permission to travel with me. It is no surprise Fischl speaks with a\nstrange choice of words. However, this time, not even Oz, her raven friend,\ncan interpret her expressions! Maybe you can help us understand what this\nyoung princess is saying? You are given a string of \n    n\n lowercase Latin\nletters, the word that Fischl just spoke. You think that the MEX of this\nstring may help you find the meaning behind this message. The MEX of the\nstring is defined as the shortest string that doesn't appear as a contiguous\nsubstring in the input. If multiple strings exist, the lexicographically\nsmallest one is considered the MEX. Note that the empty substring does NOT\ncount as a valid MEX. A string \n    a\n is lexicographically smaller than a\nstring \n    b\n if and only if one of the following holds: \n    a\n is a prefix\nof \n    b\n, but \n    a \n     b\n; in the first position where \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n differ, the string \n    a\n has a letter that appears earlier in the\nalphabet than the corresponding letter in \n    b\n. A string \n    a\n is a\nsubstring of a string \n    b\n if \n    a\n can be obtained from \n    b\n by\ndeletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and\nseveral (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end. Find out what the MEX\nof the string is! Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n).\nDescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the length of the\nword. The second line for each test case contains a single string of \n    n\n\nlowercase Latin letters. The sum of \n    n\n over all test cases will not\nexceed \n    1000\n. Output For each test case, output the MEX of the string on\na new line. Example Input 3 28 qaabzwsxedcrfvtgbyhnujmiklop 13 cleanairactbd\n10 aannttoonn Output ac f b\n\n",
