        "description": "New Year is coming in Tree World! In this world, as the name implies, there\nare n cities connected by n - 1 roads, and for any two distinct cities there\nalways exists a path between them. The cities are numbered by integers from 1\nto n, and the roads are numbered by integers from 1 to n - 1. Let's define\nd(u, v) as total length of roads on the path between city u and city v. As an\nannual event, people in Tree World repairs exactly one road per year. As a\nresult, the length of one road decreases. It is already known that in the i-th\nyear, the length of the ri-th road is going to become wi, which is shorter\nthan its length before. Assume that the current year is year 1. Three Santas\nare planning to give presents annually to all the children in Tree World. In\norder to do that, they need some preparation, so they are going to choose\nthree distinct cities c1, c2, c3 and make exactly one warehouse in each city.\nThe k-th (1 \u2264 k \u2264 3) Santa will take charge of the warehouse in city ck. It is\nreally boring for the three Santas to keep a warehouse alone. So, they decided\nto build an only-for-Santa network! The cost needed to build this network\nequals to d(c1, c2) + d(c2, c3) + d(c3, c1) dollars. Santas are too busy to\nfind the best place, so they decided to choose c1, c2, c3 randomly uniformly\nover all triples of distinct numbers from 1 to n. Santas would like to know\nthe expected value of the cost needed to build the network. However, as\nmentioned, each year, the length of exactly one road decreases. So, the Santas\nwant to calculate the expected after each length change. Help them to\ncalculate the value. Input The first line contains an integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5)\n\u2014 the number of cities in Tree World. Next n - 1 lines describe the roads. The\ni-th line of them (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n - 1) contains three space-separated integers ai,\nbi, li (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 n, ai \u2260 bi, 1 \u2264 li \u2264 10^3), denoting that the i-th road\nconnects cities ai and bi, and the length of i-th road is li. The next line\ncontains an integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of road length changes. Next\nq lines describe the length changes. The j-th line of them (1 \u2264 j \u2264 q)\ncontains two space-separated integers rj, wj (1 \u2264 rj \u2264 n - 1, 1 \u2264 wj \u2264 10^3).\nIt means that in the j-th repair, the length of the rj-th road becomes wj. It\nis guaranteed that wj is smaller than the current length of the rj-th road.\nThe same road can be repaired several times. Output Output q numbers. For each\ngiven change, print a line containing the expected cost needed to build the\nnetwork in Tree World. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute\nand relative error doesn't exceed 10^-6. Examples Input 3 2 3 5 1 3 3 5 1 4 2\n2 1 2 2 1 1 1 Output 14.0000000000 12.0000000000 8.0000000000 6.0000000000\n4.0000000000 Input 6 1 5 3 5 3 2 6 1 7 1 4 4 5 2 3 5 1 2 2 1 3 5 4 1 5 2\nOutput 19.6000000000 18.6000000000 16.6000000000 13.6000000000 12.6000000000\nNote Consider the first sample. There are 6 triples: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2,\n1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1). Because n = 3, the cost needed to\nbuild the network is always d(1, 2) + d(2, 3) + d(3, 1) for all the triples.\nSo, the expected cost equals to d(1, 2) + d(2, 3) + d(3, 1).\n\n",
