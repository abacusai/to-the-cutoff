        "description": "In all schools in Buryatia, in the \n    1\n class, everyone is told the theory\nof Fibonacci strings. \"A block is a subsegment of a string where all the\nletters are the same and are bounded on the left and right by the ends of the\nstring or by letters other than the letters in the block. A string is called a\nFibonacci string if, when it is divided into blocks, their lengths in the\norder they appear in the string form the Fibonacci sequence (\n    f_0 = f_1 =\n    1\n, \n    f_i = f_i-2 + f_i-1\n), starting from the zeroth member of this\nsequence. A string is called semi-Fibonacci if it possible to reorder its\nletters to get a Fibonacci string.\" Burenka decided to enter the Buryat State\nUniversity, but at the entrance exam she was given a difficult task. She was\ngiven a string consisting of the letters of the Buryat alphabet (which\ncontains exactly \n    k\n letters), and was asked if the given string is semi-\nFibonacci. The string can be very long, so instead of the string, she was\ngiven the number of appearances of each letter (\n    c_i\n for the \n    i\n-th\nletter) in that string. Unfortunately, Burenka no longer remembers the theory\nof Fibonacci strings, so without your help she will not pass the exam. Input\nThe first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. The following is a description of the input data\nsets. The first line of each test case contains one integer \n    k\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of letters in the alphabet. The second\nline of each test case contains \n    k\n integers \n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_k\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of occurrences of each letter in\nthe string. Output For each test case print the string \"YES\" if the\ncorresponding string is semi-Fibonacci, and \"NO\" if it is not. You can print\n\"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" will\nbe recognized as a positive answer). Example Input 6 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 3 3 1 3 2\n7 5 6 26 8 3 4 13 34 Output YES YES NO YES NO YES Note In the first test case,\na one-character string is semi-Fibonacci, being itself a Fibonacci string. In\nthe second test case, a string of two different characters is Fibonacci. In\nthe third test case, the string \"abb\" (let the first of the alphabet letter be\na, the second letter b) is not a semi-Fibonacci string, since no permutation\nof its letters (\"abb\", \"bab\", and \"bba\") is a Fibonacci string. In the fourth\ntest case, two permutations of the letters of the string \"abaccac\" (the first\nletter is a, the second letter is b, the third letter is c) are Fibonacci\nstrings \u2014 \"abaaccc\" and \"cbccaaa\".\n\n",
