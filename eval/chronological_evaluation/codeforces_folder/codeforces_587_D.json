        "description": "Duff is one if the heads of Mafia in her country, Andarz Gu. Andarz Gu has n\ncities (numbered from 1 to n) connected by m bidirectional roads (numbered by\n1 to m). Each road has a destructing time, and a color. i-th road connects\ncities vi and ui and its color is ci and its destructing time is ti. Mafia\nwants to destruct a matching in Andarz Gu. A matching is a subset of roads\nsuch that no two roads in this subset has common endpoint. They can destruct\nthese roads in parallel, i. e. the total destruction time is a maximum over\ndestruction times of all selected roads. They want two conditions to be\nsatisfied: The remaining roads form a proper coloring. Destructing time of\nthis matching is minimized. The remaining roads after destructing this\nmatching form a proper coloring if and only if no two roads of the same color\nhave same endpoint, or, in the other words, edges of each color should form a\nmatching. There is no programmer in Mafia. That's why Duff asked for your\nhelp. Please help her and determine which matching to destruct in order to\nsatisfied those conditions (or state that this is not possible). Input The\nfirst line of input contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 5 \u00d7 10^4 and 1 \u2264 m\n\u2264 5 \u00d7 10^4), number of cities and number of roads in the country. The next m\nlines contain the the roads. i - th of them contains four integers vi, ui, ci\nand ti (1 \u2264 vi, ui \u2264 n, vi \u2260 ui and 1 \u2264 ci, ti \u2264 10^9 for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m).\nOutput In the first line of input, print \"Yes\" (without quotes) if satisfying\nthe first condition is possible and \"No\" (without quotes) otherwise. If it is\npossible, then you have to print two integers t and k in the second line, the\nminimum destructing time and the number of roads in the matching (). In the\nthird line print k distinct integers separated by spaces, indices of the roads\nin the matching in any order. Roads are numbered starting from one in order of\ntheir appearance in the input. If there's more than one solution, print any of\nthem. Examples Input 5 7 2 1 3 7 3 1 1 6 5 4 1 8 4 5 1 1 3 2 2 3 4 5 2 5 2 3 2\n4 Output Yes 3 2 4 5 Input 3 5 3 2 1 3 1 3 1 1 3 2 1 4 1 3 2 2 1 3 2 10 Output\nNo Note Graph of Andarz Gu in the first sample case is as follows: A solution\nwould be to destruct the roads with crosses. Graph of Andarz Gu in the second\nsample case is as follows:\n\n",
