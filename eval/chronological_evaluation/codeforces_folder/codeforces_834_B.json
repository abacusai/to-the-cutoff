        "name": "The Festive Evening",
        "description": "It's the end of July \u2013 the time when a festive evening is held at Jelly\nCastle! Guests from all over the kingdom gather here to discuss new trends in\nthe world of confectionery. Yet some of the things discussed here are not\nsupposed to be disclosed to the general public: the information can cause\ndiscord in the kingdom of Sweetland in case it turns out to reach the wrong\nhands. So it's a necessity to not let any uninvited guests in. There are 26\nentrances in Jelly Castle, enumerated with uppercase English letters from A to\nZ. Because of security measures, each guest is known to be assigned an\nentrance he should enter the castle through. The door of each entrance is\nopened right before the first guest's arrival and closed right after the\narrival of the last guest that should enter the castle through this entrance.\nNo two guests can enter the castle simultaneously. For an entrance to be\nprotected from possible intrusion, a candy guard should be assigned to it.\nThere are k such guards in the castle, so if there are more than k opened\ndoors, one of them is going to be left unguarded! Notice that a guard can't\nleave his post until the door he is assigned to is closed. Slastyona had a\nsuspicion that there could be uninvited guests at the evening. She knows the\norder in which the invited guests entered the castle, and wants you to help\nher check whether there was a moment when more than k doors were opened. Input\nTwo integers are given in the first string: the number of guests n and the\nnumber of guards k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 26). In the second string, n\nuppercase English letters s1s2... sn are given, where si is the entrance used\nby the i-th guest. Output Output \u00abYES\u00bb if at least one door was unguarded\nduring some time, and \u00abNO\u00bb otherwise. You can output each letter in arbitrary\ncase (upper or lower). Examples Input 5 1 AABBB Output NO Input 5 1 ABABB\nOutput YES Note In the first sample case, the door A is opened right before\nthe first guest's arrival and closed when the second guest enters the castle.\nThe door B is opened right before the arrival of the third guest, and closed\nafter the fifth one arrives. One guard can handle both doors, as the first one\nis closed before the second one is opened. In the second sample case, the door\nB is opened before the second guest's arrival, but the only guard can't leave\nthe door A unattended, as there is still one more guest that should enter the\ncastle through this door.\n\n",
