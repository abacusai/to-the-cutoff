        "description": "The Smart Beaver from ABBYY plans a space travel on an ultramodern spaceship.\nDuring the voyage he plans to visit n planets. For planet i ai is the maximum\nnumber of suitcases that an alien tourist is allowed to bring to the planet,\nand bi is the number of citizens on the planet. The Smart Beaver is going to\nbring some presents from ABBYY to the planets he will be visiting. The\npresents are packed in suitcases, x presents in each. The Beaver will take to\nthe ship exactly a1 + ... + an suitcases. As the Beaver lands on the i-th\nplanet, he takes ai suitcases and goes out. On the first day on the planet the\nBeaver takes a walk and gets to know the citizens. On the second and all\nsubsequent days the Beaver gives presents to the citizens \u2014 each of the bi\ncitizens gets one present per day. The Beaver leaves the planet in the evening\nof the day when the number of presents left is strictly less than the number\nof citizens (i.e. as soon as he won't be able to give away the proper number\nof presents the next day). He leaves the remaining presents at the hotel. The\nBeaver is going to spend exactly c days traveling. The time spent on flights\nbetween the planets is considered to be zero. In how many ways can one choose\nthe positive integer x so that the planned voyage will take exactly c days?\nInput The first input line contains space-separated integers n and c \u2014 the\nnumber of planets that the Beaver is going to visit and the number of days he\nis going to spend traveling, correspondingly. The next n lines contain pairs\nof space-separated integers ai, bi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of suitcases he\ncan bring to the i-th planet and the number of citizens of the i-th planet,\ncorrespondingly. The input limitations for getting 30 points are: 1 \u2264 n \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 ai \u2264 100 1 \u2264 bi \u2264 100 1 \u2264 c \u2264 100 The input limitations for getting 100\npoints are: 1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^4 0 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9 1 \u2264 bi \u2264 10^9 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^9 Due to\npossible overflow, it is recommended to use the 64-bit arithmetic. In some\nsolutions even the 64-bit arithmetic can overflow. So be careful in\ncalculations! Output Print a single number k \u2014 the number of ways to choose x\nso as to travel for exactly c days. If there are infinitely many possible\nvalues of x, print -1. Please do not use the \n64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the \nspecifier. Examples Input 2 5 1 5 2 4 Output 1 Note In the first example there\nis only one suitable value x = 5. Then the Beaver takes 1 suitcase with 5\npresents to the first planet. Here he spends 2 days: he hangs around on the\nfirst day, and he gives away five presents on the second day. He takes 2\nsuitcases with 10 presents to the second planet. Here he spends 3 days \u2014 he\ngives away 4 presents on the second and the third days and leaves the\nremaining 2 presents at the hotel. In total, the Beaver spends 5 days\ntraveling. For x = 4 or less the Beaver won't have enough presents for the\nsecond day on the first planet, so the voyage will end too soon. For x = 6 and\nmore the Beaver will spend at least one more day on the second planet, and the\nvoyage will take too long.\n\n",
