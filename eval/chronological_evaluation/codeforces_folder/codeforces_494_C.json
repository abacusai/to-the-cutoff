        "description": "Malek is a rich man. He also is very generous. That's why he decided to split\nhis money between poor people. A charity institute knows n poor people\nnumbered from 1 to n. The institute gave Malek q recommendations. A\nrecommendation is a segment of people like [l, r] which means the institute\nrecommended that Malek gives one dollar to every person whose number is in\nthis segment. However this charity has very odd rules about the\nrecommendations. Because of those rules the recommendations are given in such\na way that for every two recommendation [a, b] and [c, d] one of the following\nconditions holds: The two segments are completely disjoint. More formally\neither a \u2264 b < c \u2264 d or c \u2264 d < a \u2264 b One of the two segments are inside\nanother. More formally either a \u2264 c \u2264 d \u2264 b or c \u2264 a \u2264 b \u2264 d. The goodness of\na charity is the value of maximum money a person has after Malek finishes\ngiving his money. The institute knows for each recommendation what is the\nprobability that Malek will accept it. They want to know the expected value of\ngoodness of this charity. So they asked you for help. You have been given the\nlist of recommendations and for each recommendation the probability of it\nbeing accepted by Malek. You have also been given how much money each person\ninitially has. You must find the expected value of goodness. Input In the\nfirst line two space-separated integers n, q (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 5000) are\ngiven. In the second line n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 \u2264 ai \u2264\n10^9) are given meaning that person number i initially has ai dollars. Each of\nthe next q lines contains three space-separated numbers li, ri, pi (1 \u2264 li \u2264\nri \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1) where li and ri are two integers describing the segment of\nrecommendation and pi is a real number given with exactly three digits after\ndecimal point which is equal to probability of Malek accepting this\nrecommendation. Note that a segment may appear several times in\nrecommendations. Output Output the sought value. Your answer will be\nconsidered correct if its absolute or relative error is less than 10^-6.\nExamples Input 5 2 1 7 2 4 3 1 3 0.500 2 2 0.500 Output 8.000000000 Input 5 2\n281 280 279 278 282 1 4 1.000 1 4 0.000 Output 282.000000000 Input 3 5 1 2 3 1\n3 0.500 2 2 0.250 1 2 0.800 1 1 0.120 2 2 0.900 Output 4.465000000\n\n",
