        "description": "Ann has recently started commuting by subway. We know that a one ride subway\nticket costs a rubles. Besides, Ann found out that she can buy a special\nticket for m rides (she can buy it several times). It costs b rubles. Ann did\nthe math; she will need to use subway n times. Help Ann, tell her what is the\nminimum sum of money she will have to spend to make n rides? Input The single\nline contains four space-separated integers n, m, a, b (1 \u2264 n, m, a, b \u2264 1000)\n\u2014 the number of rides Ann has planned, the number of rides covered by the m\nride ticket, the price of a one ride ticket and the price of an m ride ticket.\nOutput Print a single integer \u2014 the minimum sum in rubles that Ann will need\nto spend. Examples Input 6 2 1 2 Output 6 Input 5 2 2 3 Output 8 Note In the\nfirst sample one of the optimal solutions is: each time buy a one ride ticket.\nThere are other optimal solutions. For example, buy three m ride tickets.\n\n",
