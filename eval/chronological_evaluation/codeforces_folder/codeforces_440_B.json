Petya wants all boxes to have the\nsame number of matches inside. For that, he can move a match from its box to\nthe adjacent one in one move. How many such moves does he need to achieve the\ndesired configuration? Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n50000). The second line contains n non-negative numbers that do not exceed\n10^9, the i-th written number is the number of matches in the i-th matchbox.\nIt is guaranteed that the total number of matches is divisible by n. Output\nPrint the total minimum number of moves. Examples Input 6 1 6 2 5 3 7 Output\n12\n\n",
