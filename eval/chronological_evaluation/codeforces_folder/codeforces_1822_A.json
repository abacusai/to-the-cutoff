        "description": "Mushroom Filippov cooked himself a meal and while having his lunch, he decided\nto watch a video on TubeTube. He can not spend more than \n    t\n seconds for\nlunch, so he asks you for help with the selection of video. The TubeTube feed\nis a list of \n    n\n videos, indexed from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. The \n    i\n-th\nvideo lasts \n    a_i\n seconds and has an entertainment value \n    b_i\n.\nInitially, the feed is opened on the first video, and Mushroom can skip to the\nnext video in \n    1\n second (if the next video exists). Mushroom can skip\nvideos any number of times (including zero). Help Mushroom choose one video\nthat he can open and watch in \n    t\n seconds. If there are several of them,\nhe wants to choose the most entertaining one. Print the index of any\nappropriate video, or \n    -1\n if there is no such. Input The first line of\nthe input data contains a single integer \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 1000\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases in the test. The description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of a test case contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the number of\nvideos in the feed and seconds for lunch, respectively. The second line of a\ntest case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, a_3, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 durations of videos. The third line of a test case\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, b_3, \n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i\n    \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 entertainment values of videos. Output Output \n    q\n\nintegers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As an\nanswer, output the index of the most entertaining video that Mushroom will\nhave time to watch. If there are several answers, you are allowed to output\nany of them. Output \n    -1\n, if there is no video he can watch during his\nlunch break.
