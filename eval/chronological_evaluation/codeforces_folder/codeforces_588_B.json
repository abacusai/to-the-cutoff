        "description": "Duff is in love with lovely numbers! A positive integer x is called lovely if\nand only if there is no such positive integer a > 1 such that a^2 is a divisor\nof x. Malek has a number store! In his store, he has only divisors of positive\ninteger n (and he has all of them). As a birthday present, Malek wants to give\nher a lovely number from his store. He wants this number to be as big as\npossible. Malek always had issues in math, so he asked for your help. Please\ntell him what is the biggest lovely number in his store. Input The first and\nonly line of input contains one integer, n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^12). Output Print the\nanswer in one line. Examples Input 10 Output 10 Input 12 Output 6 Note In\nfirst sample case, there are numbers 1, 2, 5 and 10 in the shop. 10 isn't\ndivisible by any perfect square, so 10 is lovely. In second sample case, there\nare numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 in the shop. 12 is divisible by 4 = 2^2, so\n12 is not lovely, while 6 is indeed lovely.\n\n",
