        "description": "Igor the analyst is at work. He learned about a feature in his text editor\ncalled \"Replace All\". Igor is too bored at work and thus he came up with the\nfollowing problem: Given two strings x and y which consist of the English\nletters 'A' and 'B' only, a pair of strings (s, t) is called good if: s and t\nconsist of the characters '0' and '1' only. 1 \u2264 |s|, |t| \u2264 n, where |z|\ndenotes the length of string z, and n is a fixed positive integer. If we\nreplace all occurrences of 'A' in x and y with the string s, and replace all\noccurrences of 'B' in x and y with the string t, then the two obtained from x\nand y strings are equal. For example, if x = AAB, y = BB and n = 4, then (01,\n0101) is one of good pairs of strings, because both obtained after replacing\nstrings are \"01010101\". The flexibility of a pair of strings x and y is the\nnumber of pairs of good strings (s, t). The pairs are ordered, for example the\npairs (0, 1) and (1, 0) are different. You're given two strings c and d. They\nconsist of characters 'A', 'B' and '?' only. Find the sum of flexibilities of\nall possible pairs of strings (c', d') such that c' and d' can be obtained\nfrom c and d respectively by replacing the question marks with either 'A' or\n'B', modulo 10^9 + 7. Input The first line contains the string c (1 \u2264 |c| \u2264\n3\u00b710^5). The second line contains the string d (1 \u2264 |d| \u2264 3\u00b710^5). The last\nline contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 3\u00b710^5). Output Output a single\ninteger: the answer to the problem, modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples Input A? ? 3\nOutput 2 Input A B 10 Output 2046 Note For the first sample, there are four\npossible pairs of (c', d'). If (c', d') = (AA, A), then the flexibility is 0.\nIf (c', d') = (AB, A), then the flexibility is 0. If (c', d') = (AA, B), then\nthe flexibility is 2, as the pairs of binary strings (1, 11), (0, 00) are the\nonly good pairs. If (c', d') = (AB, B), then the flexibility is 0. Thus, the\ntotal flexibility is 2. For the second sample, there are 2^1 + 2^2 + ... +\n2^10 = 2046 possible binary strings of length not greater 10, and the set of\npairs of good strings is precisely the set of pairs (s, s), where s is a\nbinary string of length not greater than 10.\n\n",
