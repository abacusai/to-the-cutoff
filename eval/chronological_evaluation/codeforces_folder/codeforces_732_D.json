        "description": "Vasiliy has an exam period which will continue for n days. He has to pass\nexams on m subjects. Subjects are numbered from 1 to m. About every day we\nknow exam for which one of m subjects can be passed on that day. Perhaps, some\nday you can't pass any exam. It is not allowed to pass more than one exam on\nany day. On each day Vasiliy can either pass the exam of that day (it takes\nthe whole day) or prepare all day for some exam or have a rest. About each\nsubject Vasiliy know a number ai \u2014 the number of days he should prepare to\npass the exam number i. Vasiliy can switch subjects while preparing for exams,\nit is not necessary to prepare continuously during ai days for the exam number\ni. He can mix the order of preparation for exams in any way. Your task is to\ndetermine the minimum number of days in which Vasiliy can pass all exams, or\ndetermine that it is impossible. Each exam should be passed exactly one time.\nInput The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the\nnumber of days in the exam period and the number of subjects. The second line\ncontains n integers d1, d2, ..., dn (0 \u2264 di \u2264 m), where di is the number of\nsubject, the exam of which can be passed on the day number i. If di equals 0,\nit is not allowed to pass any exams on the day number i. The third line\ncontains m positive integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^5), where ai is the\nnumber of days that are needed to prepare before passing the exam on the\nsubject i. Output Print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of days in which\nVasiliy can pass all exams. If it is impossible, print -1. Examples Input 7 2\n0 1 0 2 1 0 2 2 1 Output 5 Input 10 3 0 0 1 2 3 0 2 0 1 2 1 1 4 Output 9 Input\n5 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 Output -1 Note In the first example Vasiliy can behave as\nfollows. On the first and the second day he can prepare for the exam number 1\nand pass it on the fifth day, prepare for the exam number 2 on the third day\nand pass it on the fourth day. In the second example Vasiliy should prepare\nfor the exam number 3 during the first four days and pass it on the fifth day.\nThen on the sixth day he should prepare for the exam number 2 and then pass it\non the seventh day. After that he needs to prepare for the exam number 1 on\nthe eighth day and pass it on the ninth day. In the third example Vasiliy\ncan't pass the only exam because he hasn't anough time to prepare for it.\n\n",
