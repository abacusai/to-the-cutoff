        "description": "Thanos wants to destroy the avengers base, but he needs to destroy the\navengers along with their base. Let we represent their base with an array,\nwhere each position can be occupied by many avengers, but one avenger can\noccupy only one position. Length of their base is a perfect power of \n    2\n.\nThanos wants to destroy the base using minimum power. He starts with the whole\nbase and in one step he can do either of following: if the current length is\nat least \n    2\n, divide the base into \n    2\n equal halves and destroy them\nseparately, or burn the current base. If it contains no avenger in it, it\ntakes \n    A\n amount of power, otherwise it takes his \n    B \n    \u00b7 n_a \n    \u00b7\n    l\n amount of power, where \n    n_a\n is the number of avengers and \n    l\n is\nthe length of the current base. Output the minimum power needed by Thanos to\ndestroy the avengers' base. Input The first line contains four integers\n\n    n\n, \n    k\n, \n    A\n and \n    B\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 30\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    k \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 A,B \n    \u2264 10^4\n), where \n    2^n\n is the\nlength of the base, \n    k\n is the number of avengers and \n    A\n and \n    B\n\nare the constants explained in the question. The second line contains \n    k\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, a_3, \n    \u2026, a_k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264\n    2^n\n), where \n    a_i\n represents the position of avenger in the base.\nOutput Output one integer \u2014 the minimum power needed to destroy the avengers\nbase. Examples Input 2 2 1 2 1 3 Output 6 Input 3 2 1 2 1 7 Output 8 Note\nConsider the first example. One option for Thanos is to burn the whole base\n\n    1-4\n with power \n    2 \n    \u00b7 2 \n    \u00b7 4 = 16\n. Otherwise he can divide\nthe base into two parts \n    1-2\n and \n    3-4\n. For base \n    1-2\n, he can\neither burn it with power \n    2 \n    \u00b7 1 \n    \u00b7 2 = 4\n or divide it into\n\n    2\n parts \n    1-1\n and \n    2-2\n. For base \n    1-1\n, he can burn it with\npower \n    2 \n    \u00b7 1 \n    \u00b7 1 = 2\n. For \n    2-2\n, he can destroy it with\npower \n    1\n, as there are no avengers. So, the total power for destroying\n\n    1-2\n is \n    2 + 1 = 3\n, which is less than \n    4\n. Similarly, he needs\n\n    3\n power to destroy \n    3-4\n. The total minimum power needed is \n    6\n.\n\n",
