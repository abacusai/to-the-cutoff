        "description": "\u2014 Oh my sweet Beaverette, would you fancy a walk along a wonderful woodland\nbelt with me? \u2014 Of course, my Smart Beaver! Let us enjoy the splendid view\ntogether. How about Friday night? At this point the Smart Beaver got rushing.\nEverything should be perfect by Friday, so he needed to prepare the belt to\nthe upcoming walk. He needed to cut down several trees. Let's consider the\nwoodland belt as a sequence of trees. Each tree i is described by the esthetic\nappeal ai \u2014 some trees are very esthetically pleasing, others are 'so-so', and\nsome trees are positively ugly! The Smart Beaver calculated that he needed the\nfollowing effects to win the Beaverette's heart: The first objective is to\nplease the Beaverette: the sum of esthetic appeal of the remaining trees must\nbe maximum possible; the second objective is to surprise the Beaverette: the\nesthetic appeal of the first and the last trees in the resulting belt must be\nthe same; and of course, the walk should be successful: there must be at least\ntwo trees in the woodland belt left. Now help the Smart Beaver! Which trees\ndoes he need to cut down to win the Beaverette's heart? Input The first line\ncontains a single integer n \u2014 the initial number of trees in the woodland\nbelt, 2 \u2264 n. The second line contains space-separated integers ai \u2014 the\nesthetic appeals of each tree. All esthetic appeals do not exceed 10^9 in\ntheir absolute value. to get 30 points, you need to solve the problem with\nconstraints: n \u2264 100 (subproblem A1); to get 100 points, you need to solve the\nproblem with constraints: n \u2264 3\u00b710^5 (subproblems A1+A2). Output In the first\nline print two integers \u2014 the total esthetic appeal of the woodland belt after\nthe Smart Beaver's intervention and the number of the cut down trees k. In the\nnext line print k integers \u2014 the numbers of the trees the Beaver needs to cut\ndown. Assume that the trees are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. If\nthere are multiple solutions, print any of them. It is guaranteed that at\nleast two trees have equal esthetic appeal. Examples Input 5 1 2 3 1 2 Output\n8 1 1 Input 5 1 -2 3 1 -2 Output 5 2 2 5\n\n",
