        "description": "Vasiliy spent his vacation in a sanatorium, came back and found that he\ncompletely forgot details of his vacation! Every day there was a breakfast, a\ndinner and a supper in a dining room of the sanatorium (of course, in this\norder). The only thing that Vasiliy has now is a card from the dining room\ncontaning notes how many times he had a breakfast, a dinner and a supper\n(thus, the card contains three integers). Vasiliy could sometimes have missed\nsome meal, for example, he could have had a breakfast and a supper, but a\ndinner, or, probably, at some days he haven't been at the dining room at all.\nVasiliy doesn't remember what was the time of the day when he arrived to\nsanatorium (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper or after supper),\nand the time when he left it (before breakfast, before dinner, before supper\nor after supper). So he considers any of these options. After Vasiliy arrived\nto the sanatorium, he was there all the time until he left. Please note, that\nit's possible that Vasiliy left the sanatorium on the same day he arrived.\nAccording to the notes in the card, help Vasiliy determine the minimum number\nof meals in the dining room that he could have missed. We shouldn't count as\nmissed meals on the arrival day before Vasiliy's arrival and meals on the\ndeparture day after he left. Input The only line contains three integers b, d\nand s (0 \u2264 b, d, s \u2264 10^18, b + d + s \u2265 1) \u2014 the number of breakfasts, dinners\nand suppers which Vasiliy had during his vacation in the sanatorium. Output\nPrint single integer \u2014 the minimum possible number of meals which Vasiliy\ncould have missed during his vacation. Examples Input 3 2 1 Output 1 Input 1 0\n0 Output 0 Input 1 1 1 Output 0 Input 1000000000000000000 0\n1000000000000000000 Output 999999999999999999 Note In the first sample,\nVasiliy could have missed one supper, for example, in case he have arrived\nbefore breakfast, have been in the sanatorium for two days (including the day\nof arrival) and then have left after breakfast on the third day. In the second\nsample, Vasiliy could have arrived before breakfast, have had it, and\nimmediately have left the sanatorium, not missing any meal. In the third\nsample, Vasiliy could have been in the sanatorium for one day, not missing any\nmeal.\n\n",
