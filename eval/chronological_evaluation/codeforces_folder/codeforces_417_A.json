        "description": "The finalists of the \"Russian Code Cup\" competition in 2214 will be the\nparticipants who win in one of the elimination rounds. The elimination rounds\nare divided into main and additional. Each of the main elimination rounds\nconsists of c problems, the winners of the round are the first n people in the\nrating list. Each of the additional elimination rounds consists of d problems.\nThe winner of the additional round is one person. Besides, k winners of the\npast finals are invited to the finals without elimination. As a result of all\nelimination rounds at least n\u00b7m people should go to the finals. You need to\norganize elimination rounds in such a way, that at least n\u00b7m people go to the\nfinals, and the total amount of used problems in all rounds is as small as\npossible. Input The first line contains two integers c and d (1 \u2264 c, d \u2264 100)\n\u2014 the number of problems in the main and additional rounds, correspondingly.\nThe second line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100). Finally, the\nthird line contains an integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of the pre-chosen\nwinners. Output In the first line, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number\nof problems the jury needs to prepare. Examples Input 1 10 7 2 1 Output 2\nInput 2 2 2 1 2 Output 0\n\n",
