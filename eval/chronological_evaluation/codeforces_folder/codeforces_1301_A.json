        "name": "Three Strings",
        "description": "You are given three strings \n    a\n, \n    b\n and \n    c\n of the same length\n\n    n\n. The strings consist of lowercase English letters only. The \n    i\n-th\nletter of \n    a\n is \n    a_i\n, the \n    i\n-th letter of \n    b\n is \n    b_i\n,\nthe \n    i\n-th letter of \n    c\n is \n    c_i\n. For every \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    i \n    \u2264 n\n) you must swap (i.e. exchange) \n    c_i\n with either \n    a_i\n\nor \n    b_i\n. So in total you'll perform exactly \n    n\n swap operations, each\nof them either \n    c_i \n    \u2194 a_i\n or \n    c_i \n    \u2194\n    b_i\n (\n    i\n iterates over all integers between \n    1\n and \n    n\n,\ninclusive). For example, if \n    a\n is \"code\", \n    b\n is \"true\", and \n    c\n\nis \"help\", you can make \n    c\n equal to \"crue\" taking the \n    1\n-st and the\n\n    4\n-th letters from \n    a\n and the others from \n    b\n. In this way\n\n    a\n becomes \"hodp\" and \n    b\n becomes \"tele\". Is it possible that after\nthese swaps the string \n    a\n becomes exactly the same as the string \n    b\n?\nInput The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test\ncase contains a string of lowercase English letters \n    a\n. The second line\nof each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters \n    b\n. The\nthird line of each test case contains a string of lowercase English letters\n\n    c\n. It is guaranteed that in each test case these three strings are non-\nempty and have the same length, which is not exceeding \n    100\n. Output Print\n\n    t\n lines with answers for all test cases. For each test case: If it is\npossible to make string \n    a\n equal to string \n    b\n print \"YES\" (without\nquotes), otherwise print \"NO\" (without quotes). You can print either lowercase\nor uppercase letters in the answers. Example Input 4 aaa bbb ccc abc bca bca\naabb bbaa baba imi mii iim Output NO YES YES NO Note In the first test case,\nit is impossible to do the swaps so that string \n    a\n becomes exactly the\nsame as string \n    b\n. In the second test case, you should swap \n    c_i\n\nwith \n    a_i\n for all possible \n    i\n. After the swaps \n    a\n becomes\n\"bca\", \n    b\n becomes \"bca\" and \n    c\n becomes \"abc\". Here the strings\n\n    a\n and \n    b\n are equal. In the third test case, you should swap\n\n    c_1\n with \n    a_1\n, \n    c_2\n with \n    b_2\n, \n    c_3\n with \n    b_3\n\nand \n    c_4\n with \n    a_4\n. Then string \n    a\n becomes \"baba\", string\n\n    b\n becomes \"baba\" and string \n    c\n becomes \"abab\". Here the strings\n\n    a\n and \n    b\n are equal. In the fourth test case, it is impossible to do\nthe swaps so that string \n    a\n becomes exactly the same as string \n    b\n.\n\n",
