        "description": "Berland, 2016. The exchange rate of currency you all know against the burle\nhas increased so much that to simplify the calculations, its fractional part\nwas neglected and the exchange rate is now assumed to be an integer. Reliable\nsources have informed the financier Anton of some information about the\nexchange rate of currency you all know against the burle for tomorrow. Now\nAnton knows that tomorrow the exchange rate will be an even number, which can\nbe obtained from the present rate by swapping exactly two distinct digits in\nit. Of all the possible values that meet these conditions, the exchange rate\nfor tomorrow will be the maximum possible. It is guaranteed that today the\nexchange rate is an odd positive integer n. Help Anton to determine the\nexchange rate of currency you all know for tomorrow! Input The first line\ncontains an odd positive integer n \u2014 the exchange rate of currency you all\nknow for today. The length of number n's representation is within range from 2\nto 10^5, inclusive. The representation of n doesn't contain any leading\nzeroes. Output If the information about tomorrow's exchange rate is\ninconsistent, that is, there is no integer that meets the condition, print -\n1. Otherwise, print the exchange rate of currency you all know against the\nburle for tomorrow. This should be the maximum possible number of those that\nare even and that are obtained from today's exchange rate by swapping exactly\ntwo digits. Exchange rate representation should not contain leading zeroes.\nExamples Input 527 Output 572 Input 4573 Output 3574 Input 1357997531 Output\n-1\n\n",
