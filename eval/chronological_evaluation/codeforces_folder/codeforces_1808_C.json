        "description": "In this problem, unlike problem A, you need to look for unluckiest number, not\nthe luckiest one. Note that the constraints of this problem differ from such\nin problem A. Olympus City recently launched the production of personal\nstarships. Now everyone on Mars can buy one and fly to other planets\ninexpensively. Each starship has a number \u2014some positive integer \n    x\n.\nLet's define the luckiness of a number \n    x\n as the difference between the\nlargest and smallest digits of that number. For example, \n    142857\n has\n\n    8\n as its largest digit and \n    1\n as its smallest digit, so its\nluckiness is \n    8-1=7\n. And the number \n    111\n has all digits equal to\n\n    1\n, so its luckiness is zero. Hateehc is a famous Martian blogger who\noften flies to different corners of the solar system. To release interesting\nvideos even faster, he decided to buy himself a starship. When he came to the\nstore, he saw starships with numbers from \n    l\n to \n    r\n inclusively.\nWhile in the store, Hateehc wanted to find a starship with the unluckiest\nnumber. Since there are a lot of starships in the store, and Hateehc can't\nprogram, you have to help the blogger and write a program that answers his\nquestion. Input The first line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    600\n) \u2014the number of test cases. Each of the following \n    t\n lines\ncontains a description of the test case. The description consists of two\nintegers \n    l\n, \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 10^18\n) \u2014 the\nlargest and smallest numbers of the starships in the store. Output Print\n\n    t\n lines, one line for each test case, containing the unluckiest starship\nnumber in the store. If there are several ways to choose the unluckiest\nnumber, output any of them. Example Input 5 59 63 42 49 48 53 90 90 1 100\nOutput 63 44 53 90 1 Note Let's look at two test examples: the luckiness of\nthe number \n    59\n is \n    9 - 5 = 4\n; the luckiness of \n    60\n equals \n    6\n    - 0 = 6\n; the luckiness of \n    61\n equals \n    6 - 1 = 5\n; the luckiness of\n\n    62\n equals \n    6 - 2 = 4\n; the luckiness of \n    63\n is \n    6 - 3 = 3\n.\nSo the unluckiest number is \n    63\n.In the fifth test case, the unluckiest\nnumbers are \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    3\n, \n    4\n, \n    5\n, \n    6\n, \n    7\n,\n\n    8\n, \n    9\n, \n    11\n, \n    22\n, \n    33\n, \n    44\n, \n    55\n, \n    66\n,\n\n    77\n, \n    88\n, \n    99\n, so you are allowed to choose any of them.\n\n",
