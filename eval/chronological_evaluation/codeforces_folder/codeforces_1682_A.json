        "description": "You are given a palindromic string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n. You have to\ncount the number of indices \n    i\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n)\n such that the\nstring after removing \n    s_i\n from \n    s\n still remains a palindrome. For\nexample, consider \n    s\n = \"aba\" If we remove \n    s_1\n from \n    s\n, the\nstring becomes \"ba\" which is not a palindrome. If we remove \n    s_2\n from\n\n    s\n, the string becomes \"aa\" which is a palindrome. If we remove \n    s_3\n\nfrom \n    s\n, the string becomes \"ab\" which is not a palindrome. A palindrome\nis a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, \"abba\", \"a\",\n\"fef\" are palindromes whereas \"codeforces\", \"acd\", \"xy\" are not. Input The\ninput consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^3)\n \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each testcase\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n \n    (2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5)\n \u2014 the length\nof string \n    s\n. The second line of each test case contains a string \n    s\n\nconsisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that \n    s\n is a\npalindrome. It is guaranteed that sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not\nexceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, output a single\ninteger \u2014 the number of indices \n    i\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n)\n such that\nthe string after removing \n    s_i\n from \n    s\n still remains a palindrome.\nExample Input 3 3 aba 8 acaaaaca 2 dd Output 1 4 2 Note The first test case is\ndescribed in the statement. In the second test case, the indices \n    i\n that\nresult in palindrome after removing \n    s_i\n are \n    3, 4, 5, 6\n. Hence the\nanswer is \n    4\n. In the third test case, removal of any of the indices\nresults in \"d\" which is a palindrome. Hence the answer is \n    2\n.\n\n",
