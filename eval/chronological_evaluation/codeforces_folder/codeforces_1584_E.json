        "description": "Bob decided to take a break from calculus homework and designed a game for\nhimself. The game is played on a sequence of piles of stones, which can be\ndescribed with a sequence of integers \n    s_1, \n    \u2026, s_k\n, where\n\n    s_i\n is the number of stones in the \n    i\n-th pile. On each turn, Bob\npicks a pair of non-empty adjacent piles \n    i\n and \n    i+1\n and takes one\nstone from each. If a pile becomes empty, its adjacent piles do not become\nadjacent. The game ends when Bob can't make turns anymore. Bob considers\nhimself a winner if at the end all piles are empty. We consider a sequence of\npiles winning if Bob can start with it and win with some sequence of moves.\nYou are given a sequence \n    a_1, \n    \u2026, a_n\n, count the number of\nsubsegments of \n    a\n that describe a winning sequence of piles. In other\nwords find the number of segments \n    [l, r]\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264\n    n\n), such that the sequence \n    a_l, a_l+1, \n    \u2026, a_r\n is winning.\nInput Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each\ntest case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n). The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is guaranteed that\nthe sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n.\nOutput Print a single integer for each test case \u2014 the answer to the problem.\nExample Input 6 2 2 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 1 1 1 4 1 2 2 1 4 1 2 1 2 8 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\nOutput 1 0 4 2 1 3 Note In the first test case, Bob can't win on subsegments\nof length \n    1\n, as there is no pair of adjacent piles in an array of length\n\n    1\n. In the second test case, every subsegment is not winning. In the\nfourth test case, the subsegment \n    [1, 4]\n is winning, because Bob can make\nmoves with pairs of adjacent piles: \n    (2, 3)\n, \n    (1, 2)\n, \n    (3, 4)\n.\nAnother winning subsegment is \n    [2, 3]\n.\n\n",
