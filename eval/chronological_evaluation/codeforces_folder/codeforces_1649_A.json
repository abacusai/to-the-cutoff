        "description": "You are playing a very popular computer game. The next level consists of\n\n    n\n consecutive locations, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, each of them\ncontaining either land or water. It is known that the first and last locations\ncontain land, and for completing the level you have to move from the first\nlocation to the last. Also, if you become inside a location with water, you\nwill die, so you can only move between locations with land. You can jump\nbetween adjacent locations for free, as well as no more than once jump from\nany location with land \n    i\n to any location with land \n    i + x\n, spending\n\n    x\n coins (\n    x \n    \u2265 0\n). Your task is to spend the minimum possible\nnumber of coins to move from the first location to the last one. Note that\nthis is always possible since both the first and last locations are the land\nlocations. Input There are several test cases in the input data. The first\nline contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. This is followed by the test cases description. The\nfirst line of each test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of locations. The second line of the test case\ncontains a sequence of integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 1\n), where \n    a_i = 1\n means that the \n    i\n-th location is the\nlocation with land, and \n    a_i = 0\n means that the \n    i\n-th location is\nthe location with water. It is guaranteed that \n    a_1 = 1\n and \n    a_n =\n    1\n. Output For each test case print a single integer \u2014 the answer to the\nproblem. Example Input 3 2 1 1 5 1 0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 1 Output 0 4 2 Note In the\nfirst test case, it is enough to make one free jump from the first location to\nthe second one, which is also the last one, so the answer is \n    0\n. In the\nsecond test case, the only way to move from the first location to the last one\nis to jump between them, which will cost \n    4\n coins. In the third test\ncase, you can jump from the first location to the third for \n    2\n coins, and\nthen jump to the fourth location for free, so the answer is \n    2\n. It can be\nshown that this is the optimal way.\n\n",
