        "description": "YouKn0wWho has an integer sequence \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026 a_n\n. Now he will\nsplit the sequence \n    a\n into one or more consecutive subarrays so that each\nelement of \n    a\n belongs to exactly one subarray. Let \n    k\n be the number\nof resulting subarrays, and \n    h_1, h_2, \n    \u2026, h_k\n be the lengths of\nthe longest increasing subsequences of corresponding subarrays. For example,\nif we split \n    [2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5, 1]\n into \n    [2, 5, 3, 1, 4]\n,\n\n    [3, 2, 2, 5]\n, \n    [1]\n, then \n    h = [3, 2, 1]\n. YouKn0wWho wonders if\nit is possible to split the sequence \n    a\n in such a way that the bitwise\nXOR of \n    h_1, h_2, \n    \u2026, h_k\n is equal to \n    0\n. You have to tell\nwhether it is possible. The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence\n\n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_m\n is the longest sequence of valid indices \n    i_1,\n    i_2, \n    \u2026, i_k\n such that \n    i_1 \n     i_2 \n    \n    \u2026\n     i_k\n\nand \n    b_i_1\n     b_i_2\n    \n    \u2026\n     b_i_k\n. For example, the\nLIS of \n    [2, 5, 3, 3, 5]\n is \n    [2, 3, 5]\n, which has length \n    3\n. An\narray \n    c\n is a subarray of an array \n    b\n if \n    c\n can be obtained\nfrom \n    b\n by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the\nbeginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n). The second line of each test\ncase contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoesn't exceed \n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print \"YES\"\n(without quotes) if it is possible to split into subarrays in the desired way,\nprint \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print each letter in any\nregister (upper or lower). Example Input 4 7 1 3 4 2 2 1 5 3 1 3 4 5 1 3 2 4 2\n4 4 3 2 1 Output YES NO YES YES Note In the first test case, YouKn0wWho can\nsplit the sequence in the following way: \n    [1, 3, 4]\n, \n    [2, 2]\n, \n    [1,\n    5]\n. This way, the LIS lengths are \n    h = [3, 1, 2]\n, and the bitwise XOR\nof the LIS lengths is \n    3 \n    \u2295 1 \n    \u2295 2 = 0\n. In the second test\ncase, it can be shown that it is impossible to split the sequence into\nsubarrays that will satisfy the condition.\n\n",
