        "description": "While Mahmoud and Ehab were practicing for IOI, they found a problem which\nname was Longest common subsequence. They solved it, and then Ehab challenged\nMahmoud with another problem. Given two strings a and b, find the length of\ntheir longest uncommon subsequence, which is the longest string that is a\nsubsequence of one of them and not a subsequence of the other. A subsequence\nof some string is a sequence of characters that appears in the same order in\nthe string, The appearances don't have to be consecutive, for example, strings\n\"ac\", \"bc\", \"abc\" and \"a\" are subsequences of string \"abc\" while strings\n\"abbc\" and \"acb\" are not. The empty string is a subsequence of any string. Any\nstring is a subsequence of itself. Input The first line contains string a, and\nthe second line \u2014 string b. Both of these strings are non-empty and consist of\nlowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is not bigger\nthan 10^5 characters. Output If there's no uncommon subsequence, print \"-1\".\nOtherwise print the length of the longest uncommon subsequence of a and b.\nExamples Input abcd defgh Output 5 Input a a Output -1 Note In the first\nexample: you can choose \"defgh\" from string b as it is the longest subsequence\nof string b that doesn't appear as a subsequence of string a.\n\n",
