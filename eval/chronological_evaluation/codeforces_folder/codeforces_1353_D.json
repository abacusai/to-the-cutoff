        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n consisting of zeros. You\nperform \n    n\n actions with this array: during the \n    i\n-th action, the\nfollowing sequence of operations appears: Choose the maximum by length\nsubarray (continuous subsegment) consisting only of zeros, among all such\nsegments choose the leftmost one; Let this segment be \n    [l; r]\n. If\n\n    r-l+1\n is odd (not divisible by \n    2\n) then assign (set)\n\n    a[\n    l+r/2] := i\n (where \n    i\n is the number of the current\naction), otherwise (if \n    r-l+1\n is even) assign (set)\n\n    a[\n    l+r-1/2] := i\n. Consider the array \n    a\n of length \n    5\n\n(initially \n    a=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n). Then it changes as follows: Firstly, we\nchoose the segment \n    [1; 5]\n and assign \n    a[3] := 1\n, so \n    a\n becomes\n\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n; then we choose the segment \n    [1; 2]\n and assign\n\n    a[1] := 2\n, so \n    a\n becomes \n    [2, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n; then we choose the\nsegment \n    [4; 5]\n and assign \n    a[4] := 3\n, so \n    a\n becomes \n    [2, 0,\n    1, 3, 0]\n; then we choose the segment \n    [2; 2]\n and assign \n    a[2] :=\n    4\n, so \n    a\n becomes \n    [2, 4, 1, 3, 0]\n; and at last we choose the\nsegment \n    [5; 5]\n and assign \n    a[5] := 5\n, so \n    a\n becomes \n    [2, 4,\n    1, 3, 5]\n. Your task is to find the array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n after\nperforming all \n    n\n actions. Note that the answer exists and unique. You\nhave to answer \n    t\n independent test cases. Input The first line of the\ninput contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The only line of the test case\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of \n    a\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n (\n    \u2211 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n). Output For each test case, print the answer \u2014 the array \n    a\n of\nlength \n    n\n after performing \n    n\n actions described in the problem\nstatement. Note that the answer exists and unique. Example Input 6 1 2 3 4 5 6\nOutput 1 1 2 2 1 3 3 1 2 4 2 4 1 3 5 3 4 1 5 2 6\n\n",
