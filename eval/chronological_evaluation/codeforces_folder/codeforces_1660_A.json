        "description": "Vasya decided to go to the grocery store. He found in his wallet \n    a\n coins\nof \n    1\n burle and \n    b\n coins of \n    2\n burles. He does not yet know the\ntotal cost of all goods, so help him find out \n    s\n (\n    s > 0\n): the\nminimum positive integer amount of money he cannot pay without change or pay\nat all using only his coins. For example, if \n    a=1\n and \n    b=1\n (he has\none \n    1\n-burle coin and one \n    2\n-burle coin), then: he can pay \n    1\n\nburle without change, paying with one \n    1\n-burle coin, he can pay \n    2\n\nburle without change, paying with one \n    2\n-burle coin, he can pay \n    3\n\nburle without change by paying with one \n    1\n-burle coin and one\n\n    2\n-burle coin, he cannot pay \n    4\n burle without change (moreover, he\ncannot pay this amount at all). So for \n    a=1\n and \n    b=1\n the answer is\n\n    s=4\n. Input The first line of the input contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test. The description\nof each test case consists of one line containing two integers \n    a_i\n and\n\n    b_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264 10^8\n) \u2014 the number of \n    1\n-burle\ncoins and \n    2\n-burles coins Vasya has respectively. Output For each test\ncase, on a separate line print one integer \n    s\n (\n    s > 0\n): the minimum\npositive integer amount of money that Vasya cannot pay without change or pay\nat all. Example Input 5 1 1 4 0 0 2 0 0 2314 2374 Output 4 5 1 1 7063 Note The\nfirst test case of the example is clarified into the main part of the\nstatement. In the second test case, Vasya has only \n    1\n burle coins, and he\ncan collect either any amount from \n    1\n to \n    4\n, but \n    5\n can't. In\nthe second test case, Vasya has only \n    2\n burle coins, and he cannot pay\n\n    1\n burle without change. In the fourth test case you don't have any\ncoins, and he can't even pay \n    1\n burle.\n\n",
