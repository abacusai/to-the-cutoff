        "description": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in the constraints\nbetween both versions is colored below in red. You can make hacks only if all\nversions of the problem are solved. Marin and Gojou are playing hide-and-seek\nwith an array. Gojou initially performs the following steps: First, Gojou\nchooses \n    2\n integers \n    l\n and \n    r\n such that \n    l \n    \u2264 r\n. Then,\nGojou makes an array \n    a\n of length \n    r-l+1\n which is a permutation of\nthe array \n    [l,l+1,\n    \u2026,r]\n. Finally, Gojou chooses a secret integer\n\n    x\n and sets \n    a_i\n to \n    a_i \n    \u2295 x\n for all \n    i\n (where\n\n    \u2295\n denotes the bitwise XOR operation). Marin is then given the\nvalues of \n    l,r\n and the final array \n    a\n. She needs to find the secret\ninteger \n    x\n to win. Can you help her? Note that there may be multiple\npossible \n    x\n that Gojou could have chosen. Marin can find any possible\n\n    x\n that could have resulted in the final value of \n    a\n. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. In the first line of each test case contains two\nintegers \n    l\n and \n    r\n (\n    0\n    =\n    l\n    \u2264 r < 2^17\n). The second line\ncontains \n    r - l + 1\n integers of \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_r-l+1\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 a_i < 2^17\n). It is guaranteed that \n    a\n can be generated using\nthe steps performed by Gojou. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    r - l + 1\n\nover all test cases does not exceed \n    2^17\n. Output For each test case\nprint an integer \n    x\n. If there are multiple answers, print any. Example\nInput 3 0 3 3 2 1 0 0 3 4 7 6 5 0 2 1 2 3 Output 0 4 3 Note In the first test\ncase, the original array is \n    [3, 2, 1, 0]\n. In the second test case, the\noriginal array is \n    [0, 3, 2, 1]\n. In the third test case, the original\narray is \n    [2, 1, 0]\n.\n\n",
