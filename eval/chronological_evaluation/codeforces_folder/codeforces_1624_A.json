        "description": "Polycarp got an array of integers \n    a[1 \n    \u2026 n]\n as a gift. Now he wants\nto perform a certain number of operations (possibly zero) so that all elements\nof the array become the same (that is, to become \n    a_1=a_2=\n    \u2026=a_n\n).\nIn one operation, he can take some indices in the array and increase the\nelements of the array at those indices by \n    1\n.For example, let\n\n    a=[4,2,1,6,2]\n. He can perform the following operation: select indices 1,\n2, and 4 and increase elements of the array in those indices by \n    1\n. As a\nresult, in one operation, he can get a new state of the array\n\n    a=[5,3,1,7,2]\n. What is the minimum number of operations it can take so\nthat all elements of the array become equal to each other (that is, to become\n\n    a_1=a_2=\n    \u2026=a_n\n)? Input The first line of the input contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases\nin the test. The following are descriptions of the input test cases. The first\nline of the description of each test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the array \n    a\n. The second line of the description\nof each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 elements of the array \n    a\n. Output For each test\ncase, print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of operations to make all\nelements of the array \n    a\n equal. Example Input 3 6 3 4 2 4 1 2 3 1000 1002\n998 2 12 11 Output 3 4 1 Note First test case: \n    a=[3,4,2,4,1,2]\n take\n\n    a_3, a_5\n and perform an operation plus one on them, as a result we get\n\n    a=[3,4,3,4,2,2]\n. \n    a=[3,4,3,4,2,2]\n we take \n    a_1, a_5, a_6\n and\nperform an operation on them plus one, as a result we get\n\n    a=[4,4,3,4,3,3]\n. \n    a=[4,4,3,4,3,3]\n we take \n    a_3, a_5, a_6\n and\nperform an operation on them plus one, as a result we get\n\n    a=[4,4,4,4,4,4]\n. There are other sequences of \n    3\n operations, after\nthe application of which all elements become equal. Second test case:\n\n    a=[1000,1002,998]\n 2 times we take \n    a_1, a_3\n and perform an\noperation plus one on them, as a result we get \n    a=[1002,1002,1000]\n.\n\n    a=[1002,1002,1000]\n also take \n    a_3\n 2 times and perform an operation\nplus one on it, as a result we get \n    a=[1002,1002,1002]\n. Third test case:\n\n    a=[12,11]\n take \n    a_2\n and perform an operation plus one on it, as a\nresult we get \n    a=[12,12]\n.\n\n",
