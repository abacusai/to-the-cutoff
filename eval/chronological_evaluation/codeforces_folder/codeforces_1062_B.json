        "description": "JATC's math teacher always gives the class some interesting math problems so\nthat they don't get bored. Today the problem is as follows. Given an integer\n\n    n\n, you can perform the following operations zero or more times: mul\n\n    x\n: multiplies \n    n\n by \n    x\n (where \n    x\n is an arbitrary positive\ninteger). sqrt: replaces \n    n\n with \n    \u221a(n)\n (to apply this\noperation, \n    \u221a(n)\n must be an integer). You can perform these\noperations as many times as you like. What is the minimum value of \n    n\n,\nthat can be achieved and what is the minimum number of operations, to achieve\nthat minimum value? Apparently, no one in the class knows the answer to this\nproblem, maybe you can help them? Input The only line of the input contains a\nsingle integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the initial number.\nOutput Print two integers: the minimum integer \n    n\n that can be achieved\nusing the described operations and the minimum number of operations required.\nExamples Input 20 Output 10 2 Input 5184 Output 6 4 Note In the first example,\nyou can apply the operation mul \n    5\n to get \n    100\n and then sqrt to get\n\n    10\n. In the second example, you can first apply sqrt to get \n    72\n,\nthen mul \n    18\n to get \n    1296\n and finally two more sqrt and you get\n\n    6\n. Note, that even if the initial value of \n    n\n is less or equal\n\n    10^6\n, it can still become greater than \n    10^6\n after applying one or\nmore operations.\n\n",
