        "description": "This year a Chunin Selection Exam is held again in Konoha, and taking part in\nit are \n    n\n ninjas named \n    s_1\n, \n    s_2\n, ..., \n    s_n\n. All names\nare distinct. One of the exam stages consists of fights between the\nparticipants. This year the rules determining the ninjas for each fight are\nthe following: ninjas \n    i\n and \n    j\n fight against each other if the\nfollowing conditions are held: \n    i \n    \u2260 j\n; \n    s_j\n is a substring of\n\n    s_i\n; there is no \n    k\n except \n    i\n and \n    j\n that \n    s_j\n\nis a substring of \n    s_k\n, and \n    s_k\n is a substring of \n    s_i\n.\nA string \n    a\n is a substring of a string \n    b\n if \n    a\n can be obtained\nfrom \n    b\n by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from\nthe beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.\nYour task is to find out how many fights are going to take place this year.\nInput The first line consists of the only integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^6\n) standing for the number of examinees. The following \n    n\n\nlines contain their names. No two names coincide, all names are non-empty and\nconsist of lowercase English letters. The total length of all names doesn't\nexceed \n    10^6\n. Output Print the only integer standing for the number of\nfights. Examples Input 5 hidan dan hanabi bi nabi Output 3 Input 4 abacaba\nabaca acaba aca Output 4 Note In the first example hidan fights against dan,\nand hanabi fights against nabi, who also fights bi. Ninjas named hanabi and bi\ndon't fight each other since there is the ninja called nabi who breaks the\nthird condition for them. In the second example the fights are held between\nabacaba and acaba, abacaba and abaca, acaba and aca, abaca and aca.\n\n",
