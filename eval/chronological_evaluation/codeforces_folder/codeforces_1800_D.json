        "description": "Dmitry has a string \n    s\n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Dmitry\ndecided to remove two consecutive characters from the string \n    s\n and you\nare wondering how many different strings can be obtained after such an\noperation. For example, Dmitry has a string \"aaabcc\". You can get the\nfollowing different strings: \"abcc\"(by deleting the first two or second and\nthird characters), \"aacc\"(by deleting the third and fourth\ncharacters),\"aaac\"(by deleting the fourth and the fifth character) and \"aaab\"\n(by deleting the last two). Input The first line of input data contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 number of test cases.\nThe descriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of the description\nof each test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n). The second line of the description of each test case contains a\nstring \n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n for all test cases does not exceed \n    2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case print one integer \u2014 the number of\ndistinct strings that can be obtained by removing two consecutive letters.\nExample Input 7 6 aaabcc 10 aaaaaaaaaa 6 abcdef 7 abacaba 6 cccfff 4 abba 5\nababa Output 4 1 5 3 3 3 1 Note The first example is explained in the\nstatement. In the third example, the following strings are obtained: \"cdef\",\n\"adef\", \"abef\", \"abcf\", \"abcd\". In the seventh example, any deletion will\nresult in the string \"aba\".\n\n",
