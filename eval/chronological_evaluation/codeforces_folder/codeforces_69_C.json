        "description": "In one school with Vasya there is a student Kostya. Kostya does not like\nphysics, he likes different online games. Every day, having come home, Kostya\nthrows his bag in the farthest corner and sits down at his beloved computer.\nKostya even eats glued to the game. A few days ago Kostya bought a new RPG\ngame \"HaresButtle\", which differs from all other games in this genre. It has a\nhuge number of artifacts. As we know, artifacts are divided into basic and\ncomposite ones. Only the basic artifacts are available on sale. More powerful\ncomposite artifacts are collected from some number of basic artifacts. After\nthe composing composite artifact, all the components disappear. Kostya is the\nhead of the alliance, so he has to remember, what artifacts has not only\nhimself, but also his allies. You must identify by sequence of artifacts\npurchased by Kostya and his allies, how many and which artifacts has been\ncollected by each of them. It is believed that initially no one has any\nartifacts. Input The first line has 4 natural numbers: k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 100) \u2014 the\nnumber of Kostya's allies, n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the number of basic artifacts, m\n(0 \u2264 m \u2264 50) \u2014 the number of composite artifacts, q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 500) \u2014 the number\nof his friends' purchases. The following n lines contain the names of basic\nartifacts. After them m lines contain the descriptions of composite artifacts\nin the following format: :  ,  , ...  All the numbers are natural numbers not\nexceeding 100 (1 \u2264 X \u2264 n). The names of all artifacts are different, they are\ncomposed of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of each name is from 1 to\n100 characters inclusive. All the words in the format of the description of a\ncomposite artifact are separated by exactly one space. It is guaranteed that\nall components of the new artifact are different and have already been met in\nthe input data as the names of basic artifacts. Next, each of the following q\nlines is characterized by the number ai, the number of a friend who has bought\nthe artifact (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 k), and the name of the purchased basic artifact. Let's\nassume that the backpacks of the heroes are infinitely large and any artifact\nbought later can fit in there. It is guaranteed that after the i-th purchase\nno more than one opportunity to collect the composite artifact appears. If\nsuch an opportunity arose, the hero must take advantage of it. Output The\noutput file should consist of k blocks. The first line should contain number\nbi \u2014 the number of different artifacts the i-th ally has. Then the block\nshould contain bi lines with the names of these artifacts and the number of\nthese artifacts. At that the lines should be printed in accordance with the\nlexicographical order of the names of the artifacts. In each block all the\nartifacts must be different, and all the numbers except the bi should be\npositive.
