        "description": "Mad scientist Mike is busy carrying out experiments in chemistry. Today he\nwill attempt to join three atoms into one molecule. A molecule consists of\natoms, with some pairs of atoms connected by atomic bonds. Each atom has a\nvalence number \u2014 the number of bonds the atom must form with other atoms. An\natom can form one or multiple bonds with any other atom, but it cannot form a\nbond with itself. The number of bonds of an atom in the molecule must be equal\nto its valence number. Mike knows valence numbers of the three atoms. Find a\nmolecule that can be built from these atoms according to the stated rules, or\ndetermine that it is impossible. Input The single line of the input contains\nthree space-separated integers a, b and c (1 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the valence\nnumbers of the given atoms. Output If such a molecule can be built, print\nthree space-separated integers \u2014 the number of bonds between the 1-st and the\n2-nd, the 2-nd and the 3-rd, the 3-rd and the 1-st atoms, correspondingly. If\nthere are multiple solutions, output any of them. If there is no solution,\nprint \"Impossible\" (without the quotes). Examples Input 1 1 2 Output 0 1 1\nInput 3 4 5 Output 1 3 2 Input 4 1 1 Output Impossible Note The first sample\ncorresponds to the first figure. There are no bonds between atoms 1 and 2 in\nthis case. The second sample corresponds to the second figure. There is one or\nmore bonds between each pair of atoms. The third sample corresponds to the\nthird figure. There is no solution, because an atom cannot form bonds with\nitself. The configuration in the fourth figure is impossible as each atom must\nhave at least one atomic bond.\n\n",
