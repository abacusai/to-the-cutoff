        "name": "Dasha and Photos",
        "description": "Dasha decided to have a rest after solving the problem D and began to look\nphotos from previous competitions. Let's call photos as the matrix with the\nsize n \u00d7 m, which consists of lowercase English letters. Some k photos\nespecially interested her, because they can be received from photo-template by\npainting a rectangular area in a certain color. Let's call such photos\nspecial. More formally the i-th special photo is received from the photo-\ntemplate by replacing all characters on some rectangle with upper left corner\nof the cell with coordinates (ai, bi) and lower right corner in the cell with\ncoordinates (ci, di) to the symbol ei. Dasha asks you to find the special\nphoto so that the total distance from it to all other special photos is\nminimum. And calculate this distance. Determine the distance between two\nphotos as the sum of distances between all corresponding letters. The distance\nbetween two letters is the difference module of their positions in the\nalphabet. For example, the distance between letters 'h' and 'm' equals |8 -\n13| = 5, because the letter 'h' is the 8-th in the alphabet, the letter 'm' is\nthe 13-th. Input The first line contains three integers n, m, k (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264\n10^3, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of strings in the photo-template, the\nnumber of columns and the number of special photos which are interesting for\nDasha. The next n lines contains the string with m length which consists of\nlittle Latin characters \u2014 the description of the photo-template. Each of the\nnext k lines contains the description of the special photo in the following\nformat, \"ai bi ci di ei\" (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 ci \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 bi \u2264 di \u2264 m), where (ai, bi) \u2014\nis the coordinate of the upper left corner of the rectangle, (ci, di) \u2014 is the\ndescription of the lower right corner, and ei \u2014 is the little Latin letter\nwhich replaces the photo-template in the described rectangle. Output In the\nonly line print the minimum total distance from the found special photo to all\nother special photos. Examples Input 3 3 2 aaa aaa aaa 1 1 2 2 b 2 2 3 3 c\nOutput 10 Input 5 5 3 abcde eabcd deabc cdeab bcdea 1 1 3 4 f 1 2 3 3 e 1 3 3\n4 i Output 59 Note In the first example the photos are following: bba aaa bba\nacc aaa acc The distance between them is 10.\n\n",
