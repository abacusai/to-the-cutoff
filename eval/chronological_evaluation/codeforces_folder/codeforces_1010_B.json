        "description": "This is an interactive problem. Natasha is going to fly to Mars. Finally,\nNatasha sat in the rocket. She flies, flies... but gets bored. She wishes to\narrive to Mars already! So she decides to find something to occupy herself.\nShe couldn't think of anything better to do than to calculate the distance to\nthe red planet. Let's define \n    x\n as the distance to Mars. Unfortunately,\nNatasha does not know \n    x\n. But it is known that \n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 m\n,\nwhere Natasha knows the number \n    m\n. Besides, \n    x\n and \n    m\n are\npositive integers. Natasha can ask the rocket questions. Every question is an\ninteger \n    y\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 y \n    \u2264 m\n). The correct answer to the question\nis \n    -1\n, if \n    xy\n. But the rocket is broken \u2014 it does not always answer\ncorrectly. Precisely: let the correct answer to the current question be equal\nto \n    t\n, then, if the rocket answers this question correctly, then it will\nanswer \n    t\n, otherwise it will answer \n    -t\n. In addition, the rocket has\na sequence \n    p\n of length \n    n\n. Each element of the sequence is either\n\n    0\n or \n    1\n. The rocket processes this sequence in the cyclic order,\nthat is \n    1\n-st element, \n    2\n-nd, \n    3\n-rd, \n    \u2026\n,\n\n    (n-1)\n-th, \n    n\n-th, \n    1\n-st, \n    2\n-nd, \n    3\n-rd,\n\n    \u2026\n, \n    (n-1)\n-th, \n    n\n-th, \n    \u2026\n. If the current\nelement is \n    1\n, the rocket answers correctly, if \n    0\n \u2014 lies. Natasha\ndoesn't know the sequence \n    p\n, but she knows its length \u2014 \n    n\n. You can\nask the rocket no more than \n    60\n questions. Help Natasha find the distance\nto Mars. Assume, that the distance to Mars does not change while Natasha is\nasking questions. Your solution will not be accepted, if it does not receive\nan answer \n    0\n from the rocket (even if the distance to Mars is uniquely\ndetermined by the already received rocket's answers). Input The first line\ncontains two integers \n    m\n and \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 30\n) \u2014 the maximum distance to Mars and the number of elements\nin the sequence \n    p\n. Interaction You can ask the rocket no more than\n\n    60\n questions. To ask a question, print a number \n    y\n (\n    1\n    \u2264\n    y\n    \u2264 m\n) and an end-of-line character, then do the operation flush and\nread the answer to the question. If the program reads \n    0\n, then the\ndistance is correct and you must immediately terminate the program (for\nexample, by calling exit(0)). If you ignore this, you can get any verdict,\nsince your program will continue to read from the closed input stream. If at\nsome point your program reads \n    -2\n as an answer, it must immediately end\n(for example, by calling exit(0)). You will receive the \"Wrong answer\"\nverdict, and this will mean that the request is incorrect or the number of\nrequests exceeds \n    60\n. If you ignore this, you can get any verdict, since\nyour program will continue to read from the closed input stream. If your\nprogram's request is not a valid integer between \n    -2^31\n and\n\n    2^31-1\n (inclusive) without leading zeros, then you can get any\nverdict. You can get \"Idleness limit exceeded\" if you don't print anything or\nif you forget to flush the output. To flush the output buffer you can use\n(after printing a query and end-of-line): fflush(stdout) in C++;\nSystem.out.flush() in Java; stdout.flush() in Python; flush(output) in Pascal;\nSee the documentation for other languages.Hacking Use the following format for\nhacking: In the first line, print \n    3\n integers \n    m,n,x\n (\n    1\n    \u2264\n    x\n    \u2264 m\n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 30\n) \u2014 the maximum distance to Mars,\nthe number of elements in the sequence \n    p\n and the current distance to\nMars. In the second line, enter \n    n\n numbers, each of which is equal to\n\n    0\n or \n    1\n \u2014 sequence \n    p\n. The hacked solution will not have\naccess to the number \n    x\n and sequence \n    p\n. Example Input 5 2 1 -1 -1 1\n0 Output 1 2 4 5 3 Note In the example, hacking would look like this: 5 2 3 1\n0 This means that the current distance to Mars is equal to \n    3\n, Natasha\nknows that it does not exceed \n    5\n, and the rocket answers in order:\ncorrectly, incorrectly, correctly, incorrectly ... Really: on the first query\n(\n    1\n) the correct answer is \n    1\n, the rocket answered correctly:\n\n    1\n; on the second query (\n    2\n) the correct answer is \n    1\n, the\nrocket answered incorrectly: \n    -1\n; on the third query (\n    4\n) the\ncorrect answer is \n    -1\n, the rocket answered correctly: \n    -1\n; on the\nfourth query (\n    5\n) the correct answer is \n    -1\n, the rocket answered\nincorrectly: \n    1\n; on the fifth query (\n    3\n) the correct and incorrect\nanswer is \n    0\n.\n\n",
