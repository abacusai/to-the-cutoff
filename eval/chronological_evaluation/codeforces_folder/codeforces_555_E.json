        "description": "Andrewid the Android is a galaxy-known detective. Now he is preparing a\ndefense against a possible attack by hackers on a major computer network. In\nthis network are n vertices, some pairs of vertices are connected by m\nundirected channels. It is planned to transfer q important messages via this\nnetwork, the i-th of which must be sent from vertex si to vertex di via one or\nmore channels, perhaps through some intermediate vertices. To protect against\nattacks a special algorithm was developed. Unfortunately it can be applied\nonly to the network containing directed channels. Therefore, as new channels\ncan't be created, it was decided for each of the existing undirected channels\nto enable them to transmit data only in one of the two directions. Your task\nis to determine whether it is possible so to choose the direction for each\nchannel so that each of the q messages could be successfully transmitted.\nInput The first line contains three integers n, m and q (1 \u2264 n, m, q \u2264 2\u00b710^5)\n\u2014 the number of nodes, channels and important messages. Next m lines contain\ntwo integers each, vi and ui (1 \u2264 vi, ui \u2264 n, vi \u2260 ui), that means that\nbetween nodes vi and ui is a channel. Between a pair of nodes can exist more\nthan one channel. Next q lines contain two integers si and di (1 \u2264 si, di \u2264 n,\nsi \u2260 di) \u2014 the numbers of the nodes of the source and destination of the\ncorresponding message. It is not guaranteed that in it initially possible to\ntransmit all the messages. Output If a solution exists, print on a single line\n\"Yes\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print \"No\" (without the quotes).\nExamples Input 4 4 2 1 2 1 3 2 3 3 4 1 3 4 2 Output Yes Input 3 2 2 1 2 3 2 1\n3 2 1 Output No Input 3 3 2 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 3 2 1 Output Yes Note In the first\nsample test you can assign directions, for example, as follows: 1 \u2192 2, 1 \u2192 3,\n3 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 3. Then the path for for the first message will be 1 \u2192 3, and for\nthe second one \u2014 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 2. In the third sample test you can assign\ndirections, for example, as follows: 1 \u2192 2, 2 \u2192 1, 2 \u2192 3. Then the path for\nthe first message will be 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3, and for the second one \u2014 2 \u2192 1.\n\n",
