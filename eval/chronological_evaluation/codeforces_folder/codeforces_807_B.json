        "description": "Not so long ago the Codecraft-17 contest was held on Codeforces. The top 25\nparticipants, and additionally random 25 participants out of those who got\ninto top 500, will receive a Codeforces T-shirt. Unfortunately, you didn't\nmanage to get into top 25, but you got into top 500, taking place p. Now the\nelimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017 is being held. It has been announced\nthat the Codecraft-17 T-shirt winners will be chosen as follows. Let s be the\nnumber of points of the winner of the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup\n2017. Then the following pseudocode will be executed: i := (s div 50) mod 475\nrepeat 25 times: i := (i * 96 + 42) mod 475 print (26 + i) Here \"div\" is the\ninteger division operator, \"mod\" is the modulo (the remainder of division)\noperator. As the result of pseudocode execution, 25 integers between 26 and\n500, inclusive, will be printed. These will be the numbers of places of the\nparticipants who get the Codecraft-17 T-shirts. It is guaranteed that the 25\nprinted integers will be pairwise distinct for any value of s. You're in the\nlead of the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017, having x points. You\nbelieve that having at least y points in the current round will be enough for\nvictory. To change your final score, you can make any number of successful and\nunsuccessful hacks. A successful hack brings you 100 points, an unsuccessful\none takes 50 points from you. It's difficult to do successful hacks, though.\nYou want to win the current round and, at the same time, ensure getting a\nCodecraft-17 T-shirt. What is the smallest number of successful hacks you have\nto do to achieve that? Input The only line contains three integers p, x and y\n(26 \u2264 p \u2264 500; 1 \u2264 y \u2264 x \u2264 20000) \u2014 your place in Codecraft-17, your current\nscore in the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017, and the smallest\nnumber of points you consider sufficient for winning the current round. Output\nOutput a single integer \u2014 the smallest number of successful hacks you have to\ndo in order to both win the elimination round of 8VC Venture Cup 2017 and\nensure getting a Codecraft-17 T-shirt. It's guaranteed that your goal is\nachievable for any valid input data. Examples Input 239 10880 9889 Output 0\nInput 26 7258 6123 Output 2 Input 493 8000 8000 Output 24 Input 101 6800 6500\nOutput 0 Input 329 19913 19900 Output 8 Note In the first example, there is no\nneed to do any hacks since 10880 points already bring the T-shirt to the\n239-th place of Codecraft-17 (that is, you). In this case, according to the\npseudocode, the T-shirts will be given to the participants at the following\nplaces: 475 422 84 411 453 210 157 294 146 188 420 367 29 356 398 155 102 239\n91 133 365 312 449 301 343 In the second example, you have to do two\nsuccessful and one unsuccessful hack to make your score equal to 7408. In the\nthird example, you need to do as many as 24 successful hacks to make your\nscore equal to 10400. In the fourth example, it's sufficient to do 6\nunsuccessful hacks (and no successful ones) to make your score equal to 6500,\nwhich is just enough for winning the current round and also getting the\nT-shirt.\n\n",
