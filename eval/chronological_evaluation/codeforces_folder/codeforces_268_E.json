        "description": "Manao's friends often send him new songs. He never listens to them right away.\nInstead, he compiles them into a playlist. When he feels that his mind is open\nto new music, he opens the playlist and starts to listen to the songs. Of\ncourse, there are some songs that Manao doesn't particuarly enjoy. To get more\npleasure from the received songs, he invented the following procedure of\nlistening to the playlist: If after listening to some song Manao realizes that\nhe liked it, then he remembers it and starts to listen to the next unlistened\nsong. If after listening to some song Manao realizes that he did not like it,\nhe listens to all the songs he liked up to this point and then begins to\nlisten to the next unlistened song. For example, if Manao has four songs in\nthe playlist, A, B, C, D (in the corresponding order) and he is going to like\nsongs A and C in the end, then the order of listening is the following: Manao\nlistens to A, he likes it, he remembers it. Manao listens to B, he does not\nlike it, so he listens to A, again. Manao listens to C, he likes the song and\nhe remembers it, too. Manao listens to D, but does not enjoy it and re-listens\nto songs A and C. That is, in the end Manao listens to song A three times, to\nsong C twice and songs B and D once. Note that if Manao once liked a song, he\nwill never dislike it on a subsequent listening. Manao has received n songs:\nthe i-th of them is li seconds long and Manao may like it with a probability\nof pi percents. The songs could get on Manao's playlist in any order, so Manao\nwants to know the maximum expected value of the number of seconds after which\nthe listening process will be over, for all possible permutations of the songs\nin the playlist. Input The first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n50000). The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers, separated by\na single space \u2014 li and pi (15 \u2264 li \u2264 1000, 0 \u2264 pi \u2264 100) \u2014 the length of the\ni-th song in seconds and the probability that Manao will like the song, in\npercents. Output In a single line print a single real number \u2014 the maximum\nexpected listening time over all permutations of songs. The answer will be\nconsidered valid if the absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^-9.\nExamples Input 3 150 20 150 50 100 50 Output 537.500000000 Input 4 300 0 300\n50 240 50 360 80 Output 2121.000000000 Note Consider the first test case. If\nManao listens to the songs in the order in which they were originally\ncompiled, the mathematical expectation will be equal to 467.5 seconds. The\nmaximum expected value is obtained by putting the first song at the end of the\nplaylist. Consider the second test case. The song which is 360 seconds long\nshould be listened to first. The song 300 seconds long which Manao will\ndislike for sure should be put in the end.\n\n",
