        "description": "You're given a row with \n    n\n chairs. We call a seating of people \"maximal\"\nif the two following conditions hold: There are no neighbors adjacent to\nanyone seated. It's impossible to seat one more person without violating the\nfirst rule. The seating is given as a string consisting of zeros and ones\n(\n    0\n means that the corresponding seat is empty, \n    1\n \u2014 occupied). The\ngoal is to determine whether this seating is \"maximal\". Note that the first\nand last seats are not adjacent (if \n    n \n     2\n). Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number\nof chairs. The next line contains a string of \n    n\n characters, each of them\nis either zero or one, describing the seating. Output Output \"Yes\" (without\nquotation marks) if the seating is \"maximal\". Otherwise print \"No\". You are\nallowed to print letters in whatever case you'd like (uppercase or lowercase).\nExamples Input 3 101 Output Yes Input 4 1011 Output No Input 5 10001 Output No\nNote In sample case one the given seating is maximal. In sample case two the\nperson at chair three has a neighbour to the right. In sample case three it is\npossible to seat yet another person into chair three.\n\n",
