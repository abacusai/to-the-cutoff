        "description": "Mr. Kitayuta has just bought an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and\nm edges. The vertices of the graph are numbered from 1 to n. Each edge, namely\nedge i, has a color ci, connecting vertex ai and bi. Mr. Kitayuta wants you to\nprocess the following q queries. In the i-th query, he gives you two integers\n\u2014 ui and vi. Find the number of the colors that satisfy the following\ncondition: the edges of that color connect vertex ui and vertex vi directly or\nindirectly. Input The first line of the input contains space-separated two\nintegers \u2014 n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 100), denoting the number of the\nvertices and the number of the edges, respectively. The next m lines contain\nspace-separated three integers \u2014 ai, bi (1 \u2264 ai < bi \u2264 n) and ci (1 \u2264 ci \u2264 m).\nNote that there can be multiple edges between two vertices. However, there are\nno multiple edges of the same color between two vertices, that is, if i \u2260 j,\n(ai, bi, ci) \u2260 (aj, bj, cj). The next line contains a integer \u2014 q (1 \u2264 q \u2264\n100), denoting the number of the queries. Then follows q lines, containing\nspace-separated two integers \u2014 ui and vi (1 \u2264 ui, vi \u2264 n). It is guaranteed\nthat ui \u2260 vi. Output For each query, print the answer in a separate line.\nExamples Input 4 5 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 3 1 2 3 3 2 4 3 3 1 2 3 4 1 4 Output 2 1 0\nInput 5 7 1 5 1 2 5 1 3 5 1 4 5 1 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 4 2 5 1 5 5 1 2 5 1 5 1 4\nOutput 1 1 1 1 2 Note Let's consider the first sample. The figure above shows\nthe first sample. Vertex 1 and vertex 2 are connected by color 1 and 2. Vertex\n3 and vertex 4 are connected by color 3. Vertex 1 and vertex 4 are not\nconnected by any single color.\n\n",
