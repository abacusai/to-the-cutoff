        "description": "Oh no, this wicked jury hides something from you again, and you need to guess\nit interactively. This time, you need to find an integer \n    n\n. To do that,\nyou can make at most 10 queries of the form \"What is the \n    k\n-th decimal\ndigit of the product of all integers from 1 to \n    n\n (also known as\nfactorial and denoted as \n    n!\n)?\". Interaction In the first line, there is\nan integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of tests you shall\nprocess. For each test, the integer \n    n\n is chosen in advance. The length\nof \n    n!\n is at most \n    20\n     000\n, so \n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5982\n. You can\nmake at most 10 queries of the form \"? \n    k\n\" (\n    0 \n    \u2264 k < 20\n     000\n).\nIn response to the query, you will get a single digit \u2014 the \n    k\n-th decimal\ndigit of \n    n!\n (the response is between 0 and 9 inclusive). Digits are\nnumbered from 0, starting with the least significant digit. If \n    n!\n is too\nshort, and there is no \n    k\n-th digit, then 0 is returned. After your\nprogram finds the value of \n    n\n it shall answer with \"! \n    n\n\". If the\nanswer is correct, then you will receive \"YES\" and should proceed to the next\ntest or terminate if it was the last one. If the answer is not correct, or you\nare trying to guess, and there are several possible answers consistent with\nthe information you have received, you will get \"NO\". In that case, your\nsubmission will receive \"Wrong answer\" verdict and your code shall terminate\nimmediately. Example Input 2 1 YES 0 2 YES Output ? 0 ! 1 ? 0 ? 19997 ! 5982\n\n",
