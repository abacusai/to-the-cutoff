        "name": "Free Ice Cream",
        "description": "After their adventure with the magic mirror Kay and Gerda have returned home\nand sometimes give free ice cream to kids in the summer. At the start of the\nday they have x ice cream packs. Since the ice cream is free, people start\nstanding in the queue before Kay and Gerda's house even in the night. Each\nperson in the queue wants either to take several ice cream packs for himself\nand his friends or to give several ice cream packs to Kay and Gerda (carriers\nthat bring ice cream have to stand in the same queue). If a carrier with d ice\ncream packs comes to the house, then Kay and Gerda take all his packs. If a\nchild who wants to take d ice cream packs comes to the house, then Kay and\nGerda will give him d packs if they have enough ice cream, otherwise the child\nwill get no ice cream at all and will leave in distress. Kay wants to find the\namount of ice cream they will have after all people will leave from the queue,\nand Gerda wants to find the number of distressed kids. Input The first line\ncontains two space-separated integers n and x (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 10^9).\nEach of the next n lines contains a character '+' or '-', and an integer di,\nseparated by a space (1 \u2264 di \u2264 10^9). Record \"+ di\" in i-th line means that a\ncarrier with di ice cream packs occupies i-th place from the start of the\nqueue, and record \"- di\" means that a child who wants to take di packs stands\nin i-th place. Output Print two space-separated integers \u2014 number of ice cream\npacks left after all operations, and number of kids that left the house in\ndistress. Examples Input 5 7  5 \u00ad 10 \u00ad 20  40 \u00ad 20 Output 22 1 Input 5\n17 \u00ad 16 \u00ad 2 \u00ad 98  100 \u00ad 98 Output 3 2 Note Consider the first sample.\nInitially Kay and Gerda have 7 packs of ice cream. Carrier brings 5 more, so\nnow they have 12 packs. A kid asks for 10 packs and receives them. There are\nonly 2 packs remaining. Another kid asks for 20 packs. Kay and Gerda do not\nhave them, so the kid goes away distressed. Carrier bring 40 packs, now Kay\nand Gerda have 42 packs. Kid asks for 20 packs and receives them. There are 22\npacks remaining.\n\n",
