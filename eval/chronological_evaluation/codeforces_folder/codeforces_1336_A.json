        "description": "Writing light novels is the most important thing in Linova's life. Last night,\nLinova dreamed about a fantastic kingdom. She began to write a light novel for\nthe kingdom as soon as she woke up, and of course, she is the queen of it.\nThere are \n    n\n cities and \n    n-1\n two-way roads connecting pairs of\ncities in the kingdom. From any city, you can reach any other city by walking\nthrough some roads. The cities are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, and the\ncity \n    1\n is the capital of the kingdom. So, the kingdom has a tree\nstructure. As the queen, Linova plans to choose exactly \n    k\n cities\ndeveloping industry, while the other cities will develop tourism. The capital\nalso can be either industrial or tourism city. A meeting is held in the\ncapital once a year. To attend the meeting, each industry city sends an envoy.\nAll envoys will follow the shortest path from the departure city to the\ncapital (which is unique). Traveling in tourism cities is pleasant. For each\nenvoy, his happiness is equal to the number of tourism cities on his path. In\norder to be a queen loved by people, Linova wants to choose \n    k\n cities\nwhich can maximize the sum of happinesses of all envoys. Can you calculate the\nmaximum sum for her? Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    k\n (\n    2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    1\n    \u2264 k< n\n) \u2014 the number\nof cities and industry cities respectively. Each of the next \n    n-1\n lines\ncontains two integers \n    u\n and \n    v\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 u,v\n    \u2264 n\n), denoting\nthere is a road connecting city \n    u\n and city \n    v\n. It is guaranteed\nthat from any city, you can reach any other city by the roads. Output Print\nthe only line containing a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible sum of\nhappinesses of all envoys. Examples Input 7 4 1 2 1 3 1 4 3 5 3 6 4 7 Output 7\nInput 4 1 1 2 1 3 2 4 Output 2 Input 8 5 7 5 1 7 6 1 3 7 8 3 2 1 4 5 Output 9\nNote In the first example, Linova can choose cities \n    2\n, \n    5\n, \n    6\n,\n\n    7\n to develop industry, then the happiness of the envoy from city \n    2\n\nis \n    1\n, the happiness of envoys from cities \n    5\n, \n    6\n, \n    7\n is\n\n    2\n. The sum of happinesses is \n    7\n, and it can be proved to be the\nmaximum one. In the second example, choosing cities \n    3\n, \n    4\n\ndeveloping industry can reach a sum of \n    3\n, but remember that Linova plans\nto choose exactly \n    k\n cities developing industry, then the maximum sum is\n\n    2\n.\n\n",
