        "description": "Since astronauts from BubbleCup XI mission finished their mission on the Moon\nand are big fans of famous singer, they decided to spend some fun time before\nreturning to the Earth and hence created a so called \"Moonwalk challenge\"\ngame. Teams of astronauts are given the map of craters on the Moon and direct\nbidirectional paths from some craters to others that are safe for\n\"Moonwalking\". Each of those direct paths is colored in one color and there is\nunique path between each two craters. Goal of the game is to find two craters\nsuch that given array of colors appears most times as continuous subarray on\nthe path between those two craters (overlapping appearances should be\ncounted). To help your favorite team win, you should make a program that,\ngiven the map, answers the queries of the following type: For two craters and\narray of colors answer how many times given array appears as continuous\nsubarray on the path from the first crater to the second. Colors are\nrepresented as lowercase English alphabet letters. Input In the first line,\ninteger \n    N\n \n    (2 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 10^5)\n \u2014 number of craters on the\nMoon. Craters are numerated with numbers \n    1\n to \n    N\n. In next \n    N-1\n\nlines, three values \n    u, v, L\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 u, v \n    \u2264 N, L \n    \u2208\n    \n    a,\n    ..., z\n    \n    )\n \u2014 denoting that there is a direct path with color \n    L\n\nbetween craters \n    u\n and \n    v\n. Next line contains integer \n    Q\n \n    (1\n    \n    \u2264 Q \n    \u2264 10^5)\n \u2014 number of queries. Next \n    Q\n lines contain three\nvalues \n    u, v\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 u, v \n    \u2264 N)\n and \n    S\n \n    (|S| \n    \u2264\n    100)\n, where \n    u\n and \n    v\n are the two cratersfor which you should\nfind how many times array of colors \n    S\n (represented as string) appears on\nthe path from \n    u\n to \n    v\n. Output For each query output one number that\nrepresents number of occurrences of array S on the path from \n    u\n to\n\n    v\n. Example Input 6 2 3 g 3 4 n 5 3 o 6 1 n 1 2 d 7 1 6 n 6 4 dg 6 4 n 2\n5 og 1 2 d 6 5 go 2 3 g Output 1 1 2 0 1 1 1\n\n",
