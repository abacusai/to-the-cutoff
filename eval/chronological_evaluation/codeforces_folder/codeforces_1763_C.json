        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n of \n    n\n integers. You are allowed to perform\nthe following operation on it as many times as you want (0 or more times):\nChoose \n    2\n indices \n    i\n,\n    j\n where \n    1 \n    \u2264 i < j \n    \u2264 n\n and\nreplace \n    a_k\n for all \n    i \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 j\n with \n    |a_i - a_j|\n\nPrint the maximum sum of all the elements of the final array that you can\nobtain in such a way. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of\neach test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the array \n    a\n. The second line of each test case\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) \u2014 the elements of array \n    a\n. It's guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case, print the sum of the final array. Example Input 3 3 1 1 1 2 9\n1 3 4 9 5 Output 3 16 18 Note In the first test case, it is not possible to\nachieve a sum \n    > 3\n by using these operations, therefore the maximum sum\nis \n    3\n. In the second test case, it can be shown that the maximum sum\nachievable is \n    16\n. By using operation \n    (1,2)\n we transform the array\nfrom \n    [9,1]\n into \n    [8,8]\n, thus the sum of the final array is\n\n    16\n. In the third test case, it can be shown that it is not possible to\nachieve a sum \n    > 18\n by using these operations, therefore the maximum sum\nis \n    18\n.\n\n",
