        "description": "On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he\ntook with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some\ncells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his\ngrasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty\ncell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect. Ostap knows that grasshopper is\nable to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current\n(to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether\nintermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them.\nFor example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and\nif k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell. Your goal is to\ndetermine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get\nfrom his initial position to the cell with an insect. Input The first line of\nthe input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 1) \u2014 the\nnumber of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump. The\nsecond line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#',\n'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty,\ncharacter '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and\ngrasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts\nat this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at\nthis cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line\nexactly once. Output If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length\nk), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell\nwith the insect, print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the only line of the input.\nOtherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes). Examples Input 5 2 #G#T# Output YES\nInput 6 1 T....G Output YES Input 7 3 T..#..G Output NO Input 6 2 ..GT..\nOutput NO Note In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the\nright in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4. In the second sample, the\ngrasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the\ninsect is free \u2014 he can get there by jumping left 5 times. In the third\nsample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump. In the fourth sample, the\ngrasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able\nto reach the insect.\n\n",
