        "description": "You have an array \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n. Answer \n    q\n queries of the\nfollowing form: If we change all elements in the range \n    a_l, a_l+1,\n    \n    \u2026, a_r\n of the array to \n    k\n, will the sum of the entire array be\nodd? Note that queries are independent and do not affect future queries. Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of\ntest cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). The description of the test\ncases follows. The first line of each test case consists of \n    2\n integers\n\n    n\n and \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the array and the number of queries. The\nsecond line of each test case consists of \n    n\n integers \n    a_i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the array \n    a\n. The next \n    q\n lines of each\ntest case consists of \n    3\n integers \n    l,r,k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264\n    n\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the queries. It is guaranteed that the sum\nof \n    n\n over all test cases doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, and the\nsum of \n    q\n doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each query,\noutput \"YES\" if the sum of the entire array becomes odd, and \"NO\" otherwise.\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the\nstrings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive\nresponses. Example Input 2 5 5 2 2 1 3 2 2 3 3 2 3 4 1 5 5 1 4 9 2 4 3 10 5 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 8 13 2 5 10 3 8 10 1 10 2 1 9 100 Output YES YES YES NO\nYES NO NO NO NO YES Note For the first test case: If the elements in the range\n\n    (2, 3)\n would get set to \n    3\n the array would become \n    2, 3, 3,\n    3, 2\n, the sum would be \n    2+3+3+3+2 = 13\n which is odd, so the\nanswer is \"YES\". If the elements in the range \n    (2, 3)\n would get set to\n\n    4\n the array would become \n    2, 4, 4, 3, 2\n, the sum would be\n\n    2+4+4+3+2 = 15\n which is odd, so the answer is \"YES\". If the elements in\nthe range \n    (1, 5)\n would get set to \n    5\n the array would become\n\n    5, 5, 5, 5, 5\n, the sum would be \n    5+5+5+5+5 = 25\n which is\nodd, so the answer is \"YES\". If the elements in the range \n    (1, 4)\n would\nget set to \n    9\n the array would become \n    9, 9, 9, 9, 2\n, the\nsum would be \n    9+9+9+9+2 = 38\n which is even, so the answer is \"NO\". If the\nelements in the range \n    (2, 4)\n would get set to \n    3\n the array would\nbecome \n    2, 3, 3, 3, 2\n, the sum would be \n    2+3+3+3+2 = 13\n\nwhich is odd, so the answer is \"YES\".\n\n",
