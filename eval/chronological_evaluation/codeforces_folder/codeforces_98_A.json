        "description": "Vasilisa the Wise from a far away kingdom got a present from her friend Helga\nthe Wise from a farther away kingdom. The present is a surprise box, yet\nVasilisa the Wise doesn't know yet what the surprise actually is because she\ncannot open the box. She hopes that you can help her in that. The box's lock\nis constructed like that. The box itself is represented by an absolutely\nperfect black cube with the identical deepening on each face (those are some\nforeign nanotechnologies that the far away kingdom scientists haven't dreamt\nof). The box is accompanied by six gems whose form matches the deepenings in\nthe box's faces. The box can only be opened after it is correctly decorated by\nthe gems, that is, when each deepening contains exactly one gem. Two ways of\ndecorating the box are considered the same if they can be obtained one from\nthe other one by arbitrarily rotating the box (note that the box is\nrepresented by a perfect nanotechnological cube) Now Vasilisa the Wise wants\nto know by the given set of colors the following: in how many ways would she\ndecorate the box in the worst case to open it? To answer this question it is\nuseful to know that two gems of one color are indistinguishable from each\nother. Help Vasilisa to solve this challenging problem. Input The first line\ncontains exactly 6 characters without spaces from the set R, O, Y, G, B, V \u2014\nthey are the colors of gems with which the box should be decorated. Output\nPrint the required number of different ways to decorate the box. Examples\nInput YYYYYY Output 1 Input BOOOOB Output 2 Input ROYGBV Output 30\n\n",
