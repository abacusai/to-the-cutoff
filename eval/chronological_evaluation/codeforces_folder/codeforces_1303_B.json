        "description": "Your company was appointed to lay new asphalt on the highway of length\n\n    n\n. You know that every day you can either repair one unit of the highway\n(lay new asphalt over one unit of the highway) or skip repairing. Skipping the\nrepair is necessary because of the climate. The climate in your region is\nperiodical: there are \n    g\n days when the weather is good and if you lay new\nasphalt these days it becomes high-quality pavement; after that, the weather\nduring the next \n    b\n days is bad, and if you lay new asphalt these days it\nbecomes low-quality pavement; again \n    g\n good days, \n    b\n bad days and so\non. You can be sure that you start repairing at the start of a good season, in\nother words, days \n    1, 2, \n    \u2026, g\n are good. You don't really care about\nthe quality of the highway, you just want to make sure that at least half of\nthe highway will have high-quality pavement. For example, if the \n    n = 5\n\nthen at least \n    3\n units of the highway should have high quality; if \n    n =\n    4\n then at least \n    2\n units should have high quality. What is the minimum\nnumber of days is needed to finish the repair of the whole highway? Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Next \n    T\n lines contain test cases \u2014 one per\nline. Each line contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    g\n and \n    b\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n, g, b \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the length of the highway and the number of\ngood and bad days respectively. Output Print \n    T\n integers \u2014 one per test\ncase. For each test case, print the minimum number of days required to repair\nthe whole highway if at least half of it should have high quality. Example\nInput 3 5 1 1 8 10 10 1000000 1 1000000 Output 5 8 499999500000 Note In the\nfirst test case, you can just lay new asphalt each day, since days \n    1, 3,\n    5\n are good. In the second test case, you can also lay new asphalt each day,\nsince days \n    1\n-\n    8\n are good.\n\n",
