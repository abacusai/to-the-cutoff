        "description": "Shrimpy Duc is a fat and greedy boy who is always hungry. After a while of\nsearching for food to satisfy his never-ending hunger, Shrimpy Duc finds M   M;\ncandies lying unguarded on a \n    L \n    \u00d7 L\n grid. There are \n    n\n M   M;\ncandies on the grid, the \n    i\n-th M   M; is currently located at \n    (x_i +\n    0.5, y_i + 0.5),\n and has color \n    c_i\n out of a total of \n    k\n colors\n(the size of M   Ms; are insignificant). Shrimpy Duc wants to steal a rectangle\nof M   Ms;, specifically, he wants to select a rectangle with integer\ncoordinates within the grid and steal all candies within the rectangle.\nShrimpy Duc doesn't need to steal every single candy, however, he would like\nto steal at least one candy for each color. In other words, he wants to select\na rectangle whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes and whose left-\nbottom vertex \n    (X_1, Y_1)\n and right-top vertex \n    (X_2, Y_2)\n are\npoints with integer coordinates satisfying \n    0 \n    \u2264 X_1 < X_2 \n    \u2264 L\n and\n\n    0 \n    \u2264 Y_1 < Y_2 \n    \u2264 L\n, so that for every color \n    1 \n    \u2264 c \n    \u2264\n    k\n there is at least one M   M; with color \n    c\n that lies within that\nrectangle. How many such rectangles are there? This number may be large, so\nyou only need to find it modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Input The first line contains\nthree positive integers \n    n, k, L\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^3, 1 \n    \u2264 L \n    \u2264 10^9 )\n \u2014 the number of M   Ms;, the number of colors\nand the length of the grid respectively. The following \n    n\n points describe\nthe M   Ms.; Each line contains three integers \n    x_i, y_i, c_i\n \n    (0 \n    \u2264\n    x_i, y_i < L, 1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 k)\n \u2014 the coordinates and color of the\n\n    i\n-th M   M; respectively. Different M   Ms; have different coordinates\n(\n    x_i \n     x_j\n or \n    y_i \n     y_j\n for every \n    i \n     j\n), and\nfor every \n    1 \n    \u2264 c \n    \u2264 k\n there is at least one M   M; with color\n\n    c\n. Output Output a single integer \u2014 the number of rectangles satisfying\nShrimpy Duc's conditions, modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n.
