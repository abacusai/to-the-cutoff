        "description": "The score of a sequence \n    [s_1, s_2, \n    \u2026, s_d]\n is defined as\n\n    s_1\n    \u00b7 s_2\n    \u00b7\n    \u2026\n    \u00b7 s_d/d!\n,\nwhere \n    d!=1\n    \u00b7 2\n    \u00b7\n    \u2026\n    \u00b7 d\n. In particular, the score\nof an empty sequence is \n    1\n. For a sequence \n    [s_1, s_2, \n    \u2026,\n    s_d]\n, let \n    m\n be the maximum score among all its subsequences. Its cost\nis defined as the maximum length of a subsequence with a score of \n    m\n. You\nare given a non-decreasing sequence \n    [a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n]\n of\nintegers of length \n    n\n. In other words, the condition \n    a_1 \n    \u2264 a_2\n    \n    \u2264\n    \u2026\n    \u2264 a_n\n is satisfied. For each \n    k=1, 2, \n    \u2026 ,\n    n\n, find the cost of the sequence \n    [a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026 , a_k]\n. A\nsequence \n    x\n is a subsequence of a sequence \n    y\n if \n    x\n can be\nobtained from \n    y\n by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.\nInput Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the\nnumber of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). The description of\nthe test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the given sequence. The\nsecond line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the given sequence. It\nis guaranteed that its elements are in non-decreasing order. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    5\n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, output \n    n\n integers \u2014 the costs of\nsequences \n    [a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026 , a_k]\n in ascending order of \n    k\n.\nExample Input 3 3 1 2 3 2 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 5 Output 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 Note In\nthe first test case: The maximum score among the subsequences of \n    [1]\n is\n\n    1\n. The subsequences \n    [1]\n and \n    []\n (the empty sequence) are the\nonly ones with this score. Thus, the cost of \n    [1]\n is \n    1\n. The maximum\nscore among the subsequences of \n    [1, 2]\n is \n    2\n. The only subsequence\nwith this score is \n    [2]\n. Thus, the cost of \n    [1, 2]\n is \n    1\n. The\nmaximum score among the subsequences of \n    [1, 2, 3]\n is \n    3\n. The\nsubsequences \n    [2, 3]\n and \n    [3]\n are the only ones with this score.\nThus, the cost of \n    [1, 2, 3]\n is \n    2\n. Therefore, the answer to this\ncase is \n    1\n     \n     1\n     \n     2\n, which are the costs of \n    [1], [1, 2]\n\nand \n    [1, 2, 3]\n in this order.\n\n",
