        "description": "Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed\nto enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis.\nIt's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the\nperiod of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and\nmove to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town\nVi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom! Leha came up\nwith a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers A and B and\nthen calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"A factorial\" and \"B\nfactorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(A!, B!). It's well known\nthat the factorial of an integer x is a product of all positive integers less\nthan or equal to x. Thus x! = 1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(x - 1)\u00b7x. For example 4! = 1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74 =\n24. Recall that GCD(x, y) is the largest positive integer q that divides\n(without a remainder) both x and y. Leha has learned how to solve this task\nvery effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, aren't you? Input The\nfirst and single line contains two integers A and B (1 \u2264 A, B \u2264 10^9, min(A,\nB) \u2264 12). Output Print a single integer denoting the greatest common divisor\nof integers A! and B!. Example Input 4 3 Output 6 Note Consider the sample. 4!\n= 1\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74 = 24. 3! = 1\u00b72\u00b73 = 6. The greatest common divisor of integers 24 and\n6 is exactly 6.\n\n",
