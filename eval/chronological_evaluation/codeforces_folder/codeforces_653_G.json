        "description": "Pussycat Sonya has an array consisting of n positive integers. There are 2^n\npossible subsequences of the array. For each subsequence she counts the\nminimum number of operations to make all its elements equal. Each operation\nmust be one of two: Choose some element of the subsequence and multiply it by\nsome prime number. Choose some element of the subsequence and divide it by\nsome prime number. The chosen element must be divisible by the chosen prime\nnumber. What is the sum of minimum number of operations for all 2^n possible\nsubsequences? Find and print this sum modulo 10^9 + 7. Input The first line of\nthe input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300 000) \u2014 the size of the\narray. The second line contains n integers t1, t2, ..., tn (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 300 000)\n\u2014 elements of the array. Output Print the sum of minimum number of operation\nfor all possible subsequences of the given array modulo 10^9 + 7. Examples\nInput 3 60 60 40 Output 6 Input 4 1 2 3 4 Output 24 Note In the first sample,\nthere are 8 possible subsequences: (60, 60, 40), (60, 60), (60, 40), (60, 40),\n(60), (60), (40) and () (empty subsequence). For a subsequence (60, 60, 40) we\ncan make all elements equal by two operations \u2014 divide 40 by 2 to get 20, and\nthen multiply 20 by 3 to get 60. It's impossible to achieve the goal using\nless operations and thus we add 2 to the answer. There are two subsequences\nequal to (60, 40) and for each of them the also need to make at least 2\noperations. In each of other subsequences all numbers are already equal, so we\nneed 0 operations for each of them. The sum is equal to 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\n",
