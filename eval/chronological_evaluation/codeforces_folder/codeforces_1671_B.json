        "description": "You are given \n    n\n points with integer coordinates on a coordinate axis\n\n    OX\n. The coordinate of the \n    i\n-th point is \n    x_i\n. All points'\ncoordinates are distinct and given in strictly increasing order. For each\npoint \n    i\n, you can do the following operation no more than once: take this\npoint and move it by \n    1\n to the left or to the right (i..e., you can\nchange its coordinate \n    x_i\n to \n    x_i - 1\n or to \n    x_i + 1\n). In\nother words, for each point, you choose (separately) its new coordinate. For\nthe \n    i\n-th point, it can be either \n    x_i - 1\n, \n    x_i\n or \n    x_i +\n    1\n. Your task is to determine if you can move some points as described above\nin such a way that the new set of points forms a consecutive segment of\nintegers, i. e. for some integer \n    l\n the coordinates of points should be\nequal to \n    l, l + 1, \n    \u2026, l + n - 1\n. Note that the resulting points\nshould have distinct coordinates. You have to answer \n    t\n independent test\ncases. Input The first line of the input contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test\ncases follow. The first line of the test case contains one integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of points in the set\n\n    x\n. The second line of the test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    x_1 <\n    x_2 < \n    \u2026 < x_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n), where \n    x_i\n is the\ncoordinate of the \n    i\n-th point. It is guaranteed that the points are given\nin strictly increasing order (this also means that all coordinates are\ndistinct). It is also guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n does not exceed \n    2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n (\n    \u2211 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). Output For each test\ncase, print the answer \u2014 if the set of points from the test case can be moved\nto form a consecutive segment of integers, print YES, otherwise print NO.\nExample Input 5 2 1 4 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 7 1 1000000 3 2 5 6 Output YES YES NO\nYES YES\n\n",
