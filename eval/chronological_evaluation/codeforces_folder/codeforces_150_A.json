        "description": "You can't possibly imagine how cold our friends are this winter in Nvodsk! Two\nof them play the following game to warm up: initially a piece of paper has an\ninteger q. During a move a player should write any integer number that is a\nnon-trivial divisor of the last written number. Then he should run this number\nof circles around the hotel. Let us remind you that a number's divisor is\ncalled non-trivial if it is different from one and from the divided number\nitself. The first person who can't make a move wins as he continues to lie in\nhis warm bed under three blankets while the other one keeps running. Determine\nwhich player wins considering that both players play optimally. If the first\nplayer wins, print any winning first move. Input The first line contains the\nonly integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^13). Please do not use the \nread or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout\nstreams or the \nof the winning player (1 or 2). If the first player wins then the second line\nshould contain another integer \u2014 his first move (if the first player can't\neven make the first move, print 0). If there are multiple solutions, print any\nof them. Examples Input 6 Output 2 Input 30 Output 1 6 Input 1 Output 1 0 Note\nNumber 6 has only two non-trivial divisors: 2 and 3. It is impossible to make\na move after the numbers 2 and 3 are written, so both of them are winning,\nthus, number 6 is the losing number. A player can make a move and write number\n6 after number 30; 6, as we know, is a losing number. Thus, this move will\nbring us the victory.\n\n",
