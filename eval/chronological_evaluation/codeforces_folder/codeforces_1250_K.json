        "description": "There are \n    n\n lectures and \n    m\n seminars to be conducted today at the\nFaculty of Approximate Sciences. The \n    i\n-th lecture starts at \n    a_i\n\nand ends at \n    b_i\n (formally, time of the lecture spans an interval\n\n    [a_i, b_i)\n, the right bound is exclusive). The \n    j\n-th seminar starts\nat \n    p_j\n and ends at \n    q_j\n (similarly, time of the seminar spans an\ninterval \n    [p_j, q_j)\n, the right bound is exclusive). There are \n    x\n\nHD-projectors numbered from \n    1\n to \n    x\n and \n    y\n ordinary projectors\nnumbered from \n    x + 1\n to \n    x + y\n available at the faculty. Projectors\nshould be distributed in such a way that: an HD-projector is used in each\nlecture; some projector (ordinary or HD) is used in each seminar; a projector\n(ordinary or HD) can only be used in one event at the same moment of time; if\na projector is selected for an event, it is used there for the whole duration\nof the event; a projector can be reused in some following event, if it starts\nnot earlier than current event finishes. You are to find such distribution of\nprojectors, if it exists. Again, note that the right bound of the event's time\nrange is not inclusive: if some event starts exactly when another event\nfinishes, the projector can be reused (suppose that it is instantly\ntransported to the location of the event). Input The first line contains an\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 300\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each\ntest case starts with a line containing four integers \n    n, m, x, y\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 n, m, x, y \n    \u2264 300\n; \n    n+m>0\n, \n    x + y > 0\n) \u2014 the number of\nlectures, the number of seminars, the number of HD projectors and the number\nof ordinary projectors, respectively. The next \n    n\n lines describe\nlectures. Each line contains two integers \n    a_i\n, \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    < b_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the start time (inclusive) and finish time (exclusive)\nof the \n    i\n-th lecture. The next \n    m\n lines describe seminars. Each line\ncontains two integers \n    p_j\n, \n    q_j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_j < q_j \n    \u2264\n    10^6\n) \u2014 the start time (inclusive) and finish time (exclusive) of the\n\n    j\n-th seminar. Output For each test case, print YES if it is possible to\ndistribute projectors in order to meet all requirements, or NO otherwise. In\ncase of positive answer, output one additional line containing \n    n + m\n\nintegers. The first \n    n\n integers should be not less than \n    1\n and not\ngreater than \n    x\n, and the \n    i\n-th of them should be the index of HD\nprojector used in the \n    i\n-th lecture. The last \n    m\n integers should be\nnot less than \n    1\n and not greater than \n    x + y\n, and the \n    j\n-th of\nthem should be the index of projector used in the \n    j\n-th seminar. If there\nare multiple answers, print any of them.
