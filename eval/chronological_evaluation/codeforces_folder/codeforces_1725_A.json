        "name": "Accumulation of Dominoes",
        "description": "Pak Chanek has a grid that has \n    N\n rows and \n    M\n columns. Each row is\nnumbered from \n    1\n to \n    N\n from top to bottom. Each column is numbered\nfrom \n    1\n to \n    M\n from left to right. Each tile in the grid contains a\nnumber. The numbers are arranged as follows: Row \n    1\n contains integers\nfrom \n    1\n to \n    M\n from left to right. Row \n    2\n contains integers from\n\n    M+1\n to \n    2 \n    \u00d7 M\n from left to right. Row \n    3\n contains\nintegers from \n    2 \n    \u00d7 M+1\n to \n    3 \n    \u00d7 M\n from left to right.\nAnd so on until row \n    N\n. A domino is defined as two different tiles in the\ngrid that touch by their sides. A domino is said to be tight if and only if\nthe two numbers in the domino have a difference of exactly \n    1\n. Count the\nnumber of distinct tight dominoes in the grid. Two dominoes are said to be\ndistinct if and only if there exists at least one tile that is in one domino,\nbut not in the other. Input The only line contains two integers \n    N\n and\n\n    M\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 N, M \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of rows and columns in\nthe grid. Output An integer representing the number of distinct tight dominoes\nin the grid. Examples Input 3 4 Output 9 Input 2 1 Output 1 Note The picture\nbelow is the grid that Pak Chanek has in the first example. The picture below\nis an example of a tight domino in the grid.\n\n",
