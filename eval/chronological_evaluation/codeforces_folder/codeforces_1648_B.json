        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n of \n    n\n positive integers numbered from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n. Let's call an array integral if for any two, not\nnecessarily different, numbers \n    x\n and \n    y\n from this array, \n    x \n    \u2265\n    y\n, the number \n    \u230a\n    x/y\n    \n    \u230b\n\n(\n    x\n divided by \n    y\n with rounding down) is also in this array. You are\nguaranteed that all numbers in \n    a\n do not exceed \n    c\n. Your task is to\ncheck whether this array is integral. Input The input consists of multiple\ntest cases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 c \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the size of\n\n    a\n and the limit for the numbers in the array. The second line of each\ntest case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n, ..., \n    a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 c\n) \u2014 the array \n    a\n. Let \n    N\n be the sum of \n    n\n\nover all test cases and \n    C\n be the sum of \n    c\n over all test cases. It\nis guaranteed that \n    N \n    \u2264 10^6\n and \n    C \n    \u2264 10^6\n. Output For each\ntest case print Yes if the array is integral and No otherwise. Examples Input\n4 3 5 1 2 5 4 10 1 3 3 7 1 2 2 1 1 1 Output Yes No No Yes Input 1 1 1000000\n1000000 Output No Note In the first test case it is easy to see that the array\nis integral: \n    \u230a\n    1/1\n    \n    \u230b = 1\n,\n\n    a_1 = 1\n, this number occurs in the arry \n    \u230a\n    2/2\n    \n    \u230b = 1\n \n    \u230a\n    5/5\n    \n    \u230b = 1\n \n    \u230a\n    2/1\n    \n    \u230b = 2\n, \n    a_2 = 2\n, this number occurs in the array \n    \u230a\n    5/1\n    \n    \u230b = 5\n, \n    a_3 = 5\n, this number\noccurs in the array \n    \u230a\n    5/2\n    \n    \u230b =\n    2\n, \n    a_2 = 2\n, this number occurs in the array Thus, the condition is\nmet and the array is integral. In the second test case it is enough to see\nthat \n    \u230a\n    7/3\n    \n    \u230b = \n    \n    \u230a\n    2\n    1/3\n    \n    \u230b = 2\n, this number is not in \n    a\n,\nthat's why it is not integral. In the third test case \n    \u230a\n    2/2\n    \n    \u230b = 1\n, but there is only \n    2\n in the\narray, that's why it is not integral.\n\n",
