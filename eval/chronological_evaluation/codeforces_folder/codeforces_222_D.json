        "description": "A boy named Vasya has taken part in an Olympiad. His teacher knows that in\ntotal Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher\nhas the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the\nproblem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know\nVasya's chances. Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers \u2014 the best and the\nworst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the\nparticipants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the\nparticipant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got\nthe same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them\naccording to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the\nOlympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad. Input The first line\ncontains two space-separated integers n, x (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5; 0 \u2264 x \u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014\nthe number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya\nearned. The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an\n(0 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the participants' points in the first tour. The third line\ncontains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 \u2264 bi \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the\nparticipants' points in the second tour. The participants' points are given in\nthe arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad \u2014\nthere are two integers i, j (1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n) such, that ai + bj \u2265 x. Output\nPrint two space-separated integers \u2014 the best and the worst place Vasya could\nhave got on the Olympiad. Examples Input 5 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output 1 5\nInput 6 7 4 3 5 6 4 4 8 6 0 4 3 4 Output 1 5 Note In the first text sample all\n5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's\ndecision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst)\nfifth place. In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins\nagain: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total\nresults' table looks like that \u2014 4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0. In this table\nall participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a\nparticipant earned in the first and in the second tour. In the worst case\nscenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that \u2014 4:8,\n4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second\ntours, correspondingly.\n\n",
