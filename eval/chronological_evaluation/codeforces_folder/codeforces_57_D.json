        "description": "Stewie the Rabbit explores a new parallel universe. This two dimensional\nuniverse has the shape of a rectangular grid, containing n lines and m\ncolumns. The universe is very small: one cell of the grid can only contain one\nparticle. Each particle in this universe is either static or dynamic. Each\nstatic particle always remains in one and the same position. Due to\nunintelligible gravitation laws no two static particles in the parallel\nuniverse can be present in one column or row, and they also can't be present\nin the diagonally adjacent cells. A dynamic particle appears in a random empty\ncell, randomly chooses the destination cell (destination cell may coincide\nwith the start cell, see the samples) and moves there along the shortest path\nthrough the cells, unoccupied by the static particles. All empty cells have\nthe same probability of being selected as the beginning or end of the path.\nHaving reached the destination cell, the particle disappears. Only one dynamic\nparticle can exist at one moment of time. This particle can move from a cell\nto a cell if they have an adjacent side, and this transition takes exactly one\ngalactic second. Stewie got interested in what is the average lifespan of one\nparticle in the given universe. Input The first line contains two space-\nseparated integers: n, m (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000) which represent the sizes of the\nuniverse. The next n lines containing m symbols each describe the universe\nwithout dynamic particles \u2014 the j-th symbol of the i-th line equals to 'X' if\nthe cell is occupied by a static particle, and to '.' if it is empty. It is\nguaranteed that the described universe satisfies the properties described\nabove, that is no two static particles can be in one column or in one row,\nbesides, they can't be positioned in the diagonally adjacent cells. Output You\nhave to print on a single line a single number which is the average life span\nof a particle with an accuracy of at least 6 decimal places. The answer will\nbe accepted if it is within 10^-6 of absolute or relative error from the\ncorrect answer. Examples Input 2 2 .. .X Output 0.888888888889 Input 3 3 ...\n.X. ... Output 2.000000000000\n\n",
