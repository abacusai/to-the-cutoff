        "description": "The Third Doctor Who once correctly said that travel between parallel\nuniverses is \"like travelling sideways\". However, he incorrectly thought that\nthere were infinite parallel universes, whereas in fact, as we now all know,\nthere will never be more than 250. Heidi recently got her hands on a\nmultiverse observation tool. She was able to see all \n    n\n universes lined\nup in a row, with non-existent links between them. She also noticed that the\nDoctor was in the \n    k\n-th universe. The tool also points out that due to\nrestrictions originating from the space-time discontinuum, the number of\nuniverses will never exceed \n    m\n. Obviously, the multiverse is unstable\nbecause of free will. Each time a decision is made, one of two events will\nrandomly happen: a new parallel universe is created, or a non-existent link is\nbroken. More specifically, When a universe is created, it will manifest itself\nbetween any two adjacent universes or at one of the ends. When a link is\nbroken, it could be cut between any two adjacent universes. After separating\nthe multiverse into two segments, the segment NOT containing the Doctor will\ncease to exist. Heidi wants to perform a simulation of \n    t\n decisions. Each\ntime a decision is made, Heidi wants to know the length of the multiverse\n(i.e. the number of universes), and the position of the Doctor. Input The\nfirst line contains four integers \n    n\n, \n    k\n, \n    m\n and \n    t\n (\n    2\n    \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 250\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n). Each of the\nfollowing \n    t\n lines is in one of the following formats: \"\n    1\n \n    i\n\"\n\u2014 meaning that a universe is inserted at the position \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i\n    \n    \u2264 l + 1\n), where \n    l\n denotes the current length of the multiverse.\n\"\n    0\n \n    i\n\" \u2014 meaning that the \n    i\n-th link is broken (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i\n    \n    \u2264 l - 1\n), where \n    l\n denotes the current length of the multiverse.\nOutput Output \n    t\n lines. Each line should contain \n    l\n, the current\nlength of the multiverse and \n    k\n, the current position of the Doctor. It\nis guaranteed that the sequence of the steps will be valid, i.e. the\nmultiverse will have length at most \n    m\n and when the link breaking is\nperformed, there will be at least one universe in the multiverse. Example\nInput 5 2 10 4 0 1 1 1 0 4 1 2 Output 4 1 5 2 4 2 5 3 Note The multiverse\ninitially consisted of 5 universes, with the Doctor being in the second.\nFirst, link 1 was broken, leaving the multiverse with 4 universes, and the\nDoctor in the first. Then, a universe was added to the leftmost end of the\nmultiverse, increasing the multiverse length to 5, and the Doctor was then in\nthe second universe. Then, the rightmost link was broken. Finally, a universe\nwas added between the first and the second universe.\n\n",
