        "description": "Everyone knows that DNA strands consist of nucleotides. There are four types\nof nucleotides: \"A\", \"T\", \"G\", \"C\". A DNA strand is a sequence of nucleotides.\nScientists decided to track evolution of a rare species, which DNA strand was\nstring s initially. Evolution of the species is described as a sequence of\nchanges in the DNA. Every change is a change of some nucleotide, for example,\nthe following change can happen in DNA strand \"AAGC\": the second nucleotide\ncan change to \"T\" so that the resulting DNA strand is \"ATGC\". Scientists know\nthat some segments of the DNA strand can be affected by some unknown\ninfections. They can represent an infection as a sequence of nucleotides.\nScientists are interested if there are any changes caused by some infections.\nThus they sometimes want to know the value of impact of some infection to some\nsegment of the DNA. This value is computed as follows: Let the infection be\nrepresented as a string e, and let scientists be interested in DNA strand\nsegment starting from position l to position r, inclusive. Prefix of the\nstring eee... (i.e. the string that consists of infinitely many repeats of\nstring e) is written under the string s from position l to position r,\ninclusive. The value of impact is the number of positions where letter of\nstring s coincided with the letter written under it. Being a developer,\nInnokenty is interested in bioinformatics also, so the scientists asked him\nfor help. Innokenty is busy preparing VK Cup, so he decided to delegate the\nproblem to the competitors. Help the scientists! Input The first line contains\nthe string s (1 \u2264 |s| \u2264 10^5) that describes the initial DNA strand. It\nconsists only of capital English letters \"A\", \"T\", \"G\" and \"C\". The next line\ncontains single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of events. After that, q\nlines follow, each describes one event. Each of the lines has one of two\nformats: 1 x c, where x is an integer (1 \u2264 x \u2264 |s|), and c is a letter \"A\",\n\"T\", \"G\" or \"C\", which means that there is a change in the DNA: the nucleotide\nat position x is now c. 2 l r e, where l, r are integers (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 |s|),\nand e is a string of letters \"A\", \"T\", \"G\" and \"C\" (1 \u2264 |e| \u2264 10), which means\nthat scientists are interested in the value of impact of infection e to the\nsegment of DNA strand from position l to position r, inclusive. Output For\neach scientists' query (second type query) print a single integer in a new\nline \u2014 the value of impact of the infection on the DNA. Examples Input\nATGCATGC 4 2 1 8 ATGC 2 2 6 TTT 1 4 T 2 2 6 TA Output 8 2 4 Input GAGTTGTTAA 6\n2 3 4 TATGGTG 1 1 T 1 6 G 2 5 9 AGTAATA 1 10 G 2 2 6 TTGT Output 0 3 1 Note\nConsider the first example. In the first query of second type all characters\ncoincide, so the answer is 8. In the second query we compare string \"TTTTT...\"\nand the substring \"TGCAT\". There are two matches. In the third query, after\nthe DNA change, we compare string \"TATAT...\"' with substring \"TGTAT\". There\nare 4 matches.\n\n",
