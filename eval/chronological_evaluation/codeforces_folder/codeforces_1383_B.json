        "description": "Koa the Koala and her best friend want to play a game. The game starts with an\narray \n    a\n of length \n    n\n consisting of non-negative integers. Koa and\nher best friend move in turns and each have initially a score equal to\n\n    0\n. Koa starts. Let's describe a move in the game: During his move, a\nplayer chooses any element of the array and removes it from this array, xor-\ning it with the current score of the player. More formally: if the current\nscore of the player is \n    x\n and the chosen element is \n    y\n, his new\nscore will be \n    x \n    \u2295 y\n. Here \n    \u2295\n denotes bitwise XOR\noperation. Note that after a move element \n    y\n is removed from \n    a\n. The\ngame ends when the array is empty. At the end of the game the winner is the\nplayer with the maximum score. If both players have the same score then it's a\ndraw. If both players play optimally find out whether Koa will win, lose or\ndraw the game. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line\ncontains \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nDescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains the integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of\n\n    a\n. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 elements of \n    a\n. It\nis guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case print: WIN if Koa will win the game.\nLOSE if Koa will lose the game. DRAW if the game ends in a draw. Examples\nInput 3 3 1 2 2 3 2 2 3 5 0 0 0 2 2 Output WIN LOSE DRAW Input 4 5 4 1 5 1 3 4\n1 0 1 6 1 0 2 5 4 Output WIN WIN DRAW WIN Note In testcase \n    1\n of the\nfirst sample we have: \n    a = [1, 2, 2]\n. Here Koa chooses \n    1\n, other\nplayer has to choose \n    2\n, Koa chooses another \n    2\n. Score for Koa is\n\n    1 \n    \u2295 2 = 3\n and score for other player is \n    2\n so Koa wins.\n\n",
