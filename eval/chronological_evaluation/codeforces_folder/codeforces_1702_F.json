        "name": "Equate Multisets",
        "description": "Multiset \u2014is a set of numbers in which there can be equal elements, and the\norder of the numbers does not matter. Two multisets are equal when each value\noccurs the same number of times. For example, the multisets\n\n    2,2,4\n and \n    2,4,2\n are equal, but the multisets\n\n    1,2,2\n and \n    1,1,2\n \u2014 are not. You are given two\nmultisets \n    a\n and \n    b\n, each consisting of \n    n\n integers. In a\nsingle operation, any element of the \n    b\n multiset can be doubled or halved\n(rounded down). In other words, you have one of the following operations\navailable for an element \n    x\n of the \n    b\n multiset: replace \n    x\n with\n\n    x \n    \u00b7 2\n, or replace \n    x\n with \n    \u230a\n    x/2\n    \u230b\n (round down). Note that you cannot change the elements of the\n\n    a\n multiset. See if you can make the multiset \n    b\n become equal to the\nmultiset \n    a\n in an arbitrary number of operations (maybe \n    0\n). For\nexample, if \n    n = 4\n, \n    a = \n    \n    4, 24, 5, 2\n, \n    b = \n    \n    4, 1, 6,\n    11\n, then the answer is yes. We can proceed as follows: Replace \n    1\n\nwith \n    1 \n    \u00b7 2 = 2\n. We get \n    b = \n    \n    4, 2, 6, 11\n. Replace\n\n    11\n with \n    \u230a\n    11/2\n    \u230b = 5\n. We get \n    b =\n    \n    \n    4, 2, 6, 5\n. Replace \n    6\n with \n    6 \n    \u00b7 2 = 12\n. We get\n\n    b = \n    \n    4, 2, 12, 5\n. Replace \n    12\n with \n    12 \n    \u00b7 2 =\n    24\n. We get \n    b = \n    \n    4, 2, 24, 5\n. Got equal multisets \n    a =\n    \n    \n    4, 24, 5, 2\n and \n    b = \n    \n    4, 2, 24, 5\n. Input The first\nline of input data contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines.\nThe first line of the test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014the number of elements in the multisets \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n. The second line gives \n    n\n integers: \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_1 \n    \u2264 a_2 \n    \u2264\n    \u2026\n    \u2264 a_n \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014the elements\nof the multiset \n    a\n. Note that the elements may be equal. The third line\ncontains \n    n\n integers: \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_1 \n    \u2264\n    b_2 \n    \u2264\n    \u2026\n    \u2264 b_n \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 elements of the multiset \n    b\n.\nNote that the elements may be equal. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n\nvalues over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case, print on a separate line: YES if you can make the multiset\n\n    b\n become equal to \n    a\n, NO otherwise. You can output YES and NO in\nany case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as\npositive answer). Example Input 5 4 2 4 5 24 1 4 6 11 3 1 4 17 4 5 31 5 4 7 10\n13 14 2 14 14 26 42 5 2 2 4 4 4 28 46 62 71 98 6 1 2 10 16 64 80 20 43 60 74\n85 99 Output YES NO YES YES YES Note The first example is explained in the\nstatement. In the second example, it is impossible to get the value \n    31\n\nfrom the numbers of the multiset \n    b\n by available operations. In the third\nexample, we can proceed as follows: Replace \n    2\n with \n    2 \n    \u00b7 2 =\n    4\n. We get \n    b = \n    \n    4, 14, 14, 26, 42\n. Replace \n    14\n with\n\n    \u230a\n    14/2\n    \u230b = 7\n. We get \n    b = \n    \n    4, 7, 14, 26,\n    42\n. Replace \n    26\n with \n    \u230a\n    26/2\n    \u230b =\n    13\n. We get \n    b = \n    \n    4, 7, 14, 13, 42\n. Replace \n    42\n with\n\n    \u230a\n    42/2\n    \u230b = 21\n. We get \n    b = \n    \n    4, 7, 14,\n    13, 21\n. Replace \n    21\n with \n    \u230a\n    21/2\n    \u230b =\n    10\n. We get \n    b = \n    \n    4, 7, 14, 13, 10\n. Got equal multisets \n    a =\n    \n    \n    4, 7, 10, 13, 14\n and \n    b = \n    \n    4, 7, 14, 13, 10\n.\n\n",
