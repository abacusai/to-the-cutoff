        "description": "To confuse the opponents, the Galactic Empire represents fractions in an\nunusual format. The fractions are represented as two sets of integers. The\nproduct of numbers from the first set gives the fraction numerator, the\nproduct of numbers from the second set gives the fraction denominator.\nHowever, it turned out that the programs that work with fractions in this\nrepresentations aren't complete, they lack supporting the operation of\nreducing fractions. Implement this operation and the Empire won't forget you.\nInput The first input line contains two space-separated integers n, m (1 \u2264 n,\nm \u2264 10^5) that show how many numbers the first set (the numerator) and the\nsecond set (the denominator) contain, correspondingly. The second line\ncontains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the\nnumbers that are multiplied to produce the numerator. The third line contains\nm space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bm (1 \u2264 bi \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the numbers that\nare multiplied to produce the denominator. Output Print the answer to the\nproblem in the form, similar to the form of the input data. The number of\nvalues in the sets you print nout, mout must satisfy the inequality 1 \u2264 nout,\nmout \u2264 10^5, and the actual values in the sets aout, i and bout, i must\nsatisfy the inequality 1 \u2264 aout, i, bout, i \u2264 10^7. Separate the values in the\nlines by spaces. The printed fraction must be reduced, that is, there mustn't\nbe such integer x (x > 1), that the numerator and the denominator of the\nprinted fraction are divisible by x. If there are several matching answers,\nprint any of them. Examples Input 3 2 100 5 2 50 10 Output 2 3 2 1 1 1 1 Input\n4 3 2 5 10 20 100 1 3 Output 1 1 20 3 Note In the first test sample the\nnumerator equals 1000, the denominator equals 500. If we reduce fraction\n1000/500 by the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator\n(by 500), we obtain fraction 2/1. In the second test sample the numerator\nequals 2000, the denominator equals 300. If we reduce fraction 2000/300 by the\ngreatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator (by 100), we\nobtain fraction 20/3.\n\n",
