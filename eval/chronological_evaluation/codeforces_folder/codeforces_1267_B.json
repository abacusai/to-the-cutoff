        "description": "Balph is learning to play a game called Buma. In this game, he is given a row\nof colored balls. He has to choose the color of one new ball and the place to\ninsert it (between two balls, or to the left of all the balls, or to the right\nof all the balls). When the ball is inserted the following happens repeatedly:\nif some segment of balls of the same color became longer as a result of a\nprevious action and its length became at least \n    3\n, then all the balls of\nthis segment are eliminated. Consider, for example, a row of balls\n'AAABBBWWBB'. Suppose Balph chooses a ball of color 'W' and the place to\ninsert it after the sixth ball, i. e. to the left of the two 'W's. After Balph\ninserts this ball, the balls of color 'W' are eliminated, since this segment\nwas made longer and has length \n    3\n now, so the row becomes 'AAABBBBB'. The\nballs of color 'B' are eliminated now, because the segment of balls of color\n'B' became longer and has length \n    5\n now. Thus, the row becomes 'AAA'.\nHowever, none of the balls are eliminated now, because there is no elongated\nsegment. Help Balph count the number of possible ways to choose a color of a\nnew ball and a place to insert it that leads to the elimination of all the\nballs. Input The only line contains a non-empty string of uppercase English\nletters of length at most \n    3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Each letter represents a ball\nwith the corresponding color. Output Output the number of ways to choose a\ncolor and a position of a new ball in order to eliminate all the balls.\nExamples Input BBWWBB Output 3 Input BWWB Output 0 Input BBWBB Output 0 Input\nOOOWWW Output 0 Input WWWOOOOOOWWW Output 7\n\n",
