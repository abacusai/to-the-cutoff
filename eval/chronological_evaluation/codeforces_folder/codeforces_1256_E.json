        "description": "There are \n    n\n students at your university. The programming skill of the\n\n    i\n-th student is \n    a_i\n. As a coach, you want to divide them into\nteams to prepare them for the upcoming ICPC finals. Just imagine how good this\nuniversity is if it has \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n students ready for the finals!\nEach team should consist of at least three students. Each student should\nbelong to exactly one team. The diversity of a team is the difference between\nthe maximum programming skill of some student that belongs to this team and\nthe minimum programming skill of some student that belongs to this team (in\nother words, if the team consists of \n    k\n students with programming skills\n\n    a[i_1], a[i_2], \n    \u2026, a[i_k]\n, then the diversity of this team is\n\n    max\n    _j=1^k a[i_j] - \n    min\n    _j=1^k a[i_j]\n).\nThe total diversity is the sum of diversities of all teams formed. Your task\nis to minimize the total diversity of the division of students and find the\noptimal way to divide the students. Input The first line of the input contains\none integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\nstudents. The second line of the input contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), where \n    a_i\n is the\nprogramming skill of the \n    i\n-th student. Output In the first line print\ntwo integers \n    res\n and \n    k\n \u2014 the minimum total diversity of the\ndivision of students and the number of teams in your division,\ncorrespondingly. In the second line print \n    n\n integers \n    t_1, t_2,\n    \n    \u2026, t_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t_i \n    \u2264 k\n), where \n    t_i\n is the number of\nteam to which the \n    i\n-th student belong. If there are multiple answers,\nyou can print any. Note that you don't need to minimize the number of teams.\nEach team should consist of at least three students. Examples Input 5 1 1 3 4\n2 Output 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 Input 6 1 5 12 13 2 15 Output 7 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 Input 10\n1 2 5 129 185 581 1041 1909 1580 8150 Output 7486 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 Note\nIn the first example, there is only one team with skills \n    [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nso the answer is \n    3\n. It can be shown that you cannot achieve a better\nanswer. In the second example, there are two teams with skills \n    [1, 2, 5]\n\nand \n    [12, 13, 15]\n so the answer is \n    4 + 3 = 7\n. In the third example,\nthere are three teams with skills \n    [1, 2, 5]\n, \n    [129, 185, 581, 1041]\n\nand \n    [1580, 1909, 8150]\n so the answer is \n    4 + 912 + 6570 = 7486\n.\n\n",
