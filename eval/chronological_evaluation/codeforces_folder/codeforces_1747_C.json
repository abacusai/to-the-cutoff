        "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game on an array \n    a\n of \n    n\n positive\nintegers. Alice and Bob make alternating moves with Alice going first. In\nhis/her turn, the player makes the following move: If \n    a_1 = 0\n, the\nplayer loses the game, otherwise: Player chooses some \n    i\n with \n    2\n    \u2264 i\n    \n    \u2264 n\n. Then player decreases the value of \n    a_1\n by \n    1\n and swaps\n\n    a_1\n with \n    a_i\n. Determine the winner of the game if both players\nplay optimally. Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The first\nline contains a single integer \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^4)\n \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n\n    (2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5)\n \u2014 the length of the array \n    a\n. The second\nline of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,a_2 \n    \u2026 a_n\n\n\n    (1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 the elements of the array \n    a\n. It is\nguaranteed that sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, if Alice will win the game, output\n\"Alice\". Otherwise, output \"Bob\". You can output each letter in any case. For\nexample, \"alIcE\", \"Alice\", \"alice\" will all be considered identical. Example\nInput 3 2 1 1 2 2 1 3 5 4 4 Output Bob Alice Alice Note In the first testcase,\nin her turn, Alice can only choose \n    i = 2\n, making the array equal \n    [1,\n    0]\n. Then Bob, in his turn, will also choose \n    i = 2\n and make the array\nequal \n    [0, 0]\n. As \n    a_1 = 0\n, Alice loses. In the second testcase,\nonce again, players can only choose \n    i = 2\n. Then the array will change as\nfollows: \n    [2, 1] \n    \u2192 [1, 1] \n    \u2192 [1, 0] \n    \u2192 [0, 0]\n, and Bob loses.\nIn the third testcase, we can show that Alice has a winning strategy.\n\n",
