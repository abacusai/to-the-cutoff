        "description": "Polycarp has decided to do a problemsolving marathon. He wants to solve\n\n    s\n problems in \n    n\n days. Let \n    a_i\n be the number of problems he\nsolves during the \n    i\n-th day. He wants to find a distribution of problems\ninto days such that: \n    a_i\n is an integer value for all \n    i\n from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n; \n    a_i \n    \u2265 1\n for all \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n;\n\n    a_i + 1\n    \u2265 a_i\n for all \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n-1\n; \n    a_i +\n    1\n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 a_i\n for all \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n-1\n; \n    a_n\n\nis maximized. Note that \n    a_1\n can be arbitrarily large. What is the\nlargest value of \n    a_n\n Polycarp can obtain? Input The first line contains\na single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of\ntestcases. Then the descriptions of \n    t\n testcases follow. The only line of\neach testcase contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    s\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 s\n    \n    \u2264 10^18\n) \u2014 the number of days and the number of problems Polycarp\nwants to solve. It's guaranteed that the distribution always exists within the\ngiven constraints. Output For each testcase print a single integer \u2014 the\nmaximum value of \n    a_n\n. Example Input 3 1 15 3 9 2 6 Output 15 4 4 Note In\nthe first testcase there is only one distribution: \n    [15]\n. In the second\ntestcase the distribution that maximizes \n    a_n\n is: \n    [2, 3, 4]\n. In the\nthird testcase the distribution that maximizes \n    a_n\n is: \n    [2, 4]\n.\n\n    [3, 3]\n is a valid distribution but \n    a_n=3\n which is smaller than\n\n    4\n. \n    [1, 5]\n is not a valid distribution because \n    5 > 2 \n    \u00b7\n    1\n.\n\n",
