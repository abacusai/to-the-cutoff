        "description": "You have a password which you often type \u2014 a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n.\nEvery character of this string is one of the first \n    m\n lowercase Latin\nletters. Since you spend a lot of time typing it, you want to buy a new\nkeyboard. A keyboard is a permutation of the first \n    m\n Latin letters. For\nexample, if \n    m = 3\n, then there are six possible keyboards: abc, acb, bac,\nbca, cab and cba. Since you type your password with one finger, you need to\nspend time moving your finger from one password character to the next. The\ntime to move from character \n    s_i\n to character \n    s_i+1\n is equal to\nthe distance between these characters on keyboard. The total time you have to\nspend typing the password with a keyboard is called the slowness of this\nkeyboard. More formaly, the slowness of keyboard is equal to\n\n    \u2211\n    _i=2^n |pos_s_i-1 - pos_s_i |\n, where\n\n    pos_x\n is position of letter \n    x\n in keyboard. For example, if \n    s\n\nis aacabc and the keyboard is bac, then the total time of typing this password\nis \n    |pos_a - pos_a| + |pos_a - pos_c| + |pos_c - pos_a| + |pos_a - pos_b| +\n    |pos_b - pos_c|\n = \n    |2 - 2| + |2 - 3| + |3 - 2| + |2 - 1| + |1 - 3|\n =\n\n    0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5\n. Before buying a new keyboard you want to know the\nminimum possible slowness that the keyboard can have. Input The first line\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5, 1 \n    \u2264 m\n    \n    \u2264 20\n). The second line contains the string \n    s\n consisting of\n\n    n\n characters. Each character is one of the first \n    m\n Latin letters\n(lowercase). Output Print one integer \u2013 the minimum slowness a keyboard can\nhave. Examples Input 6 3 aacabc Output 5 Input 6 4 aaaaaa Output 0 Input 15 4\nabacabadabacaba Output 16 Note The first test case is considered in the\nstatement. In the second test case the slowness of any keyboard is \n    0\n. In\nthe third test case one of the most suitable keyboards is bacd.\n\n",
