        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n. Friends asked you to make the greatest common divisor (GCD)\nof all numbers in the array equal to \n    1\n. In one operation, you can do the\nfollowing: Select an arbitrary index in the array \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n;\nMake \n    a_i = \n    (a_i, i)\n, where \n    (x, y)\n denotes the GCD of\nintegers \n    x\n and \n    y\n. The cost of such an operation is \n    n - i +\n    1\n.You need to find the minimum total cost of operations we need to perform\nso that the GCD of the all array numbers becomes equal to \n    1\n. Input Each\ntest consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 5\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a\nsingle integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 20\n) \u2014 the length of the array.\nThe second line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the elements of the array.\nOutput For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum total cost of\noperations that will need to be performed so that the GCD of all numbers in\nthe array becomes equal to \n    1\n. We can show that it's always possible to\ndo so. Example Input 9 1 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 3 6 9 4 5 10 15 20 5 120 60 80 40 80 6\n150 90 180 120 60 30 6 2 4 6 9 12 18 6 30 60 90 120 125 125 Output 0 1 2 2 1 3\n3 0 1 Note In the first test case, the GCD of the entire array is already\nequal to \n    1\n, so there is no need to perform operations. In the second\ntest case, select \n    i = 1\n. After this operation, \n    a_1 = \n    (2, 1) =\n    1\n. The cost of this operation is \n    1\n. In the third test case, you can\nselect \n    i = 1\n, after that the array \n    a\n will be equal to \n    [1,\n    4]\n. The GCD of this array is \n    1\n, and the total cost is \n    2\n. In the\nfourth test case, you can select \n    i = 2\n, after that the array \n    a\n\nwill be equal to \n    [3, 2, 9]\n. The GCD of this array is \n    1\n, and the\ntotal cost is \n    2\n. In the sixth test case, you can select \n    i = 4\n and\n\n    i = 5\n, after that the array \n    a\n will be equal to \n    [120, 60, 80, 4,\n    5]\n. The GCD of this array is \n    1\n, and the total cost is \n    3\n.\n\n",
