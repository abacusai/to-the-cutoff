        "description": "Aleksey has \n    n\n friends. He is also on a vacation right now, so he has\n\n    m\n days to play this new viral cooperative game! But since it's\ncooperative, Aleksey will need one teammate in each of these \n    m\n days. On\neach of these days some friends will be available for playing, and all others\nwill not. On each day Aleksey must choose one of his available friends to\noffer him playing the game (and they, of course, always agree). However, if\nany of them happens to be chosen strictly more than\n\n    \u2308\n    m2\n    \n    \u2309\n times, then all other\nfriends are offended. Of course, Aleksey doesn't want to offend anyone. Help\nhim to choose teammates so that nobody is chosen strictly more than\n\n    \u2308\n    m2\n    \n    \u2309\n times. Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n). Description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n, m\n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) standing for the number of\nfriends and the number of days to play, respectively. The \n    i\n-th of the\nfollowing \n    m\n lines contains an integer \n    k_i\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 k_i\n    \u2264\n    n\n), followed by \n    k_i\n distinct integers \n    f_i1\n, ...,\n\n    f_ik_i\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 f_ij\n    \u2264 n\n), separated by spaces \u2014 indices\nof available friends on the day \n    i\n. It is guaranteed that the sums of\n\n    n\n and \n    m\n over all test cases do not exceed \n    100\n     000\n. It's\nguaranteed that the sum of all \n    k_i\n over all days of all test cases\ndoesn't exceed \n    200\n     000\n. Output Print an answer for each test case. If\nthere is no way to achieve the goal, print \"NO\". Otherwise, in the first line\nprint \"YES\", and in the second line print \n    m\n space separated integers\n\n    c_1\n, ..., \n    c_m\n. Each \n    c_i\n must denote the chosen friend on day\n\n    i\n (and therefore must be one of \n    f_ij\n). No value must occur more\nthan \n    \u2308\n    m2\n    \n    \u2309\n times. If there is\nmore than one possible answer, print any of them. Example Input 2 4 6 1 1 2 1\n2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 1 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 Output YES 1 2 1 1 2 3 NO\n\n",
