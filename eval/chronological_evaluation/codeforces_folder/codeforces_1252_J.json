        "name": "Tiling Terrace",
        "description": "Talia has just bought an abandoned house in the outskirt of Jakarta. The house\nhas a nice and long yard which can be represented as a one-dimensional grid\ncontaining \n    1 \n    \u00d7 N\n cells. To beautify the house, Talia is going to\nbuild a terrace on the yard by tiling the cells. Each cell on the yard\ncontains either soil (represented by the character '.') or rock (represented\nby the character '#'), and there are at most \n    50\n cells containing rocks.\nBeing a superstitious person, Talia wants to tile the terrace with mystical\ntiles that have the power to repel ghosts. There are three types of mystical\ntiles: Type-1: Covers \n    1 \n    \u00d7 1\n cell and can only be placed on a soil\ncell (\".\"). Type-2: Covers \n    1 \n    \u00d7 2\n cells and can only be placed on\ntwo consecutive soil cells (\"..\"). Type-3: Covers \n    1 \n    \u00d7 3\n cells and\ncan only be placed on consecutive soil-rock-soil cells (\".#.\"). Each tile of\nType-1, Type-2, and Type-3 has the power to repel \n    G_1\n, \n    G_2\n, and\n\n    G_3\n ghosts per day, respectively. There are also some mystical rules\nwhich must be followed for the power to be effective: There should be no\noverlapping tiles, i.e. each cell is covered by at most one tile. There should\nbe at most \n    K\n tiles of Type-1, while there are no limitations for tiles\nof Type-2 and Type-3. Talia is scared of ghosts, thus, the terrace (which is\ntiled by mystical tiles) should be able to repel as many ghosts as possible.\nHelp Talia to find the maximum number of ghosts that can be repelled per day\nby the terrace. Note that Talia does not need to tile all the cells on the\nyard as long as the number of ghosts that can be repelled by the terrace is\nmaximum. Input Input begins with a line containing five integers: \n    N\n\n\n    K\n \n    G_1\n \n    G_2\n \n    G_3\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n; \n    0\n    \n    \u2264 K \n    \u2264 N\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264 G_1, G_2, G_3 \n    \u2264 1000\n) representing the\nnumber of cells, the maximum number of tiles of Type-1, the number of ghosts\nrepelled per day by a tile of Type-1, the number of ghosts repelled per day by\na tile of Type-2, and the number of ghosts repelled by a tile of Type-3,\nrespectively. The next line contains a string of \n    N\n characters\nrepresenting the yard. Each character in the string is either '.' which\nrepresents a soil cell or '#' which represents a rock cell. There are at most\n\n    50\n rock cells. Output Output in a line an integer representing the\nmaximum number of ghosts that can be repelled per day. Examples Input 6 4 10\n25 40 ..#... Output 75 Input 6 4 10 100 40 ..#... Output 210 Input 7 2 30 10\n100 ..#...# Output 160 Note Explanation for the sample input/output #1 Let \"A\"\nbe a tile of Type-1, \"BB\" be a tile of Type-2, and \"CCC\" be a tile of Type-3.\nThe tiling \"ACCCBB\" in this case produces the maximum number of ghosts that\ncan be repelled, i.e. \n    10 + 40 + 25 = 75\n Explanation for the sample\ninput/output #2 This sample input has the same yard with the previous sample\ninput, but each tile of Type-2 can repel more ghosts per day. The tiling\n\"BB#BBA\" or \"BB#ABB\" produces the maximum number of ghosts that can be\nrepelled, i.e. \n    100 + 100 + 10 = 210\n. Observe that the third cell is left\nuntiled. Explanation for the sample input/output #3 The tiling \"ACCCA.#\",\n\"ACCC.A#\", or \".CCCAA#\" produces the maximum number of ghosts that can be\nrepelled, i.e. \n    30 + 100 + 30 = 160\n. Observe that there is no way to tile\nthe last cell.\n\n",
