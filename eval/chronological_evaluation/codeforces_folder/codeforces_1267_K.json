        "description": "Karl is developing a key storage service. Each user has a positive integer\nkey. Karl knows that storing keys in plain text is bad practice. So, instead\nof storing a key, he decided to store a fingerprint of a key. However, using\nsome existing fingerprint algorithm looked too boring to him, so he invented\nhis own one. Karl's fingerprint is calculated by the following process: divide\nthe given integer by 2, then divide the result by 3, then divide the result by\n4, and so on, until we get a result that equals zero (we are speaking about\ninteger division each time). The fingerprint is defined as the multiset of the\nremainders of these divisions. For example, this is how Karl's fingerprint\nalgorithm is applied to the key 11: 11 divided by 2 has remainder 1 and result\n5, then 5 divided by 3 has remainder 2 and result 1, and 1 divided by 4 has\nremainder 1 and result 0. Thus, the key 11 produces the sequence of remainders\n\n    [1, 2, 1]\n and has the fingerprint multiset \n    1, 1, 2\n.\nKsenia wants to prove that Karl's fingerprint algorithm is not very good. For\nexample, she found that both keys 178800 and 123456 produce the fingerprint of\n\n    0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 4\n. Thus, users are at risk of fingerprint\ncollision with some commonly used and easy to guess keys like 123456. Ksenia\nwants to make her words more persuasive. She wants to calculate the number of\nother keys that have the same fingerprint as the keys in the given list of\nsome commonly used keys. Your task is to help her. Input The first line\ncontains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 50\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of\ncommonly used keys to examine. Each of the next \n    t\n lines contains one\ninteger \n    k_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k_i \n    \u2264 10^18\n) \u2014 the key itself. Output\nFor each of the keys print one integer \u2014 the number of other keys that have\nthe same fingerprint. Example Input 3 1 11 123456 Output 0 1 127 Note The\nother key with the same fingerprint as 11 is 15. 15 produces a sequence of\nremainders \n    [1, 1, 2]\n. So both numbers have the fingerprint multiset\n\n    1, 1, 2\n.\n\n",
