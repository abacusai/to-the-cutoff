        "description": "A patient has been infected with an unknown disease. His body can be seen as\nan infinite grid of triangular cells which looks as follows: Two cells are\nneighboring if they share a side. Therefore, each cell (\n    x\n, \n    y\n) has\nexactly three neighbors: (\n    x+1\n, \n    y\n) (\n    x-1\n, \n    y\n) (\n    x+1\n,\n\n    y-1\n) if \n    x\n is even and (\n    x-1\n, \n    y+1\n) otherwise. Initially\nsome cells are infected, all the others are healthy. The process of recovery\nbegins. Each second, for exactly one cell (even though there might be multiple\ncells that could change its state) one of the following happens: A healthy\ncell with at least \n    2\n infected neighbors also becomes infected. An\ninfected cell with at least \n    2\n healthy neighbors also becomes healthy. If\nno such cell exists, the process of recovery stops. Patient is considered\nrecovered if the process of recovery has stopped and all the cells are\nhealthy. We're interested in a worst-case scenario: is it possible that the\npatient never recovers, or if it's not possible, what is the maximum possible\nduration of the recovery process? Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 250000)\n \u2014 the number of infected cells. The\n\n    i\n-th of the next \n    n\n lines contains two space-separated integers\n\n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n \n    (0 \n    \u2264 x_i, y_i < 500)\n, meaning that cell\n\n    (x_i, y_i)\n is infected. All cells \n    (x_i, y_i)\n are distinct, and all\nother cells are considered healthy. Output If it is possible that the organism\nnever fully recovers from the disease, print SICK. Otherwise, you should print\nRECOVERED and in the next line an integer \n    k\n \u2014 the longest possible\nrecovery period, modulo \n    998244353\n. Examples Input 4 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1\nOutput RECOVERED 4 Input 3 1 0 3 0 1 1 Output SICK Note For the first\ntestcase, the following drawings describe the longest possible recovery\nprocess. It can be proven that there are no recovery periods of length \n    5\n\nor longer, and the organism always recovers in this testcase.\n\n    \u2193\n \n    \u2193\n\n\n    \u2193\n \n    \u2193\n\n\n    \n RECOVERED For the second testcase, it is possible for\nthe cells \n    (2, 0)\n, \n    (2, 1)\n, \n    (0, 1)\n to become infected. After\nthat, no cell can change its state, so the answer is SICK, as not all of the\ncells are healthy.\n\n",
