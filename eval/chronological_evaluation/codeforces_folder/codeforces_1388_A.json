        "name": "Captain Flint and Crew Recruitment",
        "description": "Despite his bad reputation, Captain Flint is a friendly person (at least,\nfriendly to animals). Now Captain Flint is searching worthy sailors to join\nhis new crew (solely for peaceful purposes). A sailor is considered as worthy\nif he can solve Flint's task. Recently, out of blue Captain Flint has been\ninterested in math and even defined a new class of integers. Let's define a\npositive integer \n    x\n as nearly prime if it can be represented as \n    p\n    \n    \u00b7 q\n, where \n    1 < p < q\n and \n    p\n and \n    q\n are prime numbers.\nFor example, integers \n    6\n and \n    10\n are nearly primes (since \n    2\n    \n    \u00b7 3 = 6\n and \n    2 \n    \u00b7 5 = 10\n), but integers \n    1\n, \n    3\n,\n\n    4\n, \n    16\n, \n    17\n or \n    44\n are not. Captain Flint guessed an\ninteger \n    n\n and asked you: can you represent it as the sum of \n    4\n\ndifferent positive integers where at least \n    3\n of them should be nearly\nprime. Uncle Bogdan easily solved the task and joined the crew. Can you do the\nsame? Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Next \n    t\n lines contain test\ncases \u2014 one per line. The first and only line of each test case contains the\nsingle integer \n    n\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5)\n \u2014 the number\nFlint guessed. Output For each test case print: YES and \n    4\n different\npositive integers such that at least \n    3\n of them are nearly prime and\ntheir sum is equal to \n    n\n (if there are multiple answers print any of\nthem); NO if there is no way to represent \n    n\n as the sum of \n    4\n\ndifferent positive integers where at least \n    3\n of them are nearly prime.\nYou can print each character of YES or NO in any case. Example Input 7 7 23 31\n36 44 100 258 Output NO NO YES 14 10 6 1 YES 5 6 10 15 YES 6 7 10 21 YES 2 10\n33 55 YES 10 21 221 6 Note In the first and second test cases, it can be\nproven that there are no four different positive integers such that at least\nthree of them are nearly prime. In the third test case, \n    n=31=2 \n    \u00b7 7 +\n    2 \n    \u00b7 5 + 2 \n    \u00b7 3 + 1\n: integers \n    14\n, \n    10\n, \n    6\n are\nnearly prime. In the fourth test case, \n    n=36=5 + 2 \n    \u00b7 3 + 2 \n    \u00b7 5 +\n    3 \n    \u00b7 5\n: integers \n    6\n, \n    10\n, \n    15\n are nearly prime. In the\nfifth test case, \n    n=44=2 \n    \u00b7 3 + 7 + 2 \n    \u00b7 5 + 3 \n    \u00b7 7\n:\nintegers \n    6\n, \n    10\n, \n    21\n are nearly prime. In the sixth test case,\n\n    n=100=2 + 2 \n    \u00b7 5 + 3 \n    \u00b7 11 + 5 \n    \u00b7 11\n: integers \n    10\n,\n\n    33\n, \n    55\n are nearly prime. In the seventh test case, \n    n=258=2\n    \n    \u00b7 5 + 3 \n    \u00b7 7 + 13 \n    \u00b7 17 + 2 \n    \u00b7 3\n: integers \n    10\n,\n\n    21\n, \n    221\n, \n    6\n are nearly prime.\n\n",
