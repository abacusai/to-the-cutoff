        "description": "Ivan likes to learn different things about numbers, but he is especially\ninterested in really big numbers. Ivan thinks that a positive integer number x\nis really big if the difference between x and the sum of its digits (in\ndecimal representation) is not less than s. To prove that these numbers may\nhave different special properties, he wants to know how rare (or not rare)\nthey are \u2014 in fact, he needs to calculate the quantity of really big numbers\nthat are not greater than n. Ivan tried to do the calculations himself, but\nsoon realized that it's too difficult for him. So he asked you to help him in\ncalculations. Input The first (and the only) line contains two integers n and\ns (1 \u2264 n, s \u2264 10^18). Output Print one integer \u2014 the quantity of really big\nnumbers that are not greater than n. Examples Input 12 1 Output 3 Input 25 20\nOutput 0 Input 10 9 Output 1 Note In the first example numbers 10, 11 and 12\nare really big. In the second example there are no really big numbers that are\nnot greater than 25 (in fact, the first really big number is 30: 30 - 3 \u2265 20).\nIn the third example 10 is the only really big number (10 - 1 \u2265 9).\n\n",
