        "description": "You come home and fell some unpleasant smell. Where is it coming from? You are\ngiven an array a. You have to answer the following queries: You are given two\nintegers l and r. Let ci be the number of occurrences of i in al: r, where al:\nr is the subarray of a from l-th element to r-th inclusive. Find the Mex of\nc0, c1, ..., c10^9 You are given two integers p to x. Change ap to x. The\nMex of a multiset of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not in the\nset. Note that in this problem all elements of a are positive, which means\nthat c0 = 0 and 0 is never the answer for the query of the second type. Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers n and q (1 \u2264 n, q \u2264 100 000) \u2014\nthe length of the array and the number of queries respectively. The second\nline of input contains n integers \u2014 a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9). Each of\nthe next q lines describes a single query. The first type of query is\ndescribed by three integers ti = 1, li, ri, where 1 \u2264 li \u2264 ri \u2264 n \u2014 the bounds\nof the subarray. The second type of query is described by three integers ti =\n2, pi, xi, where 1 \u2264 pi \u2264 n is the index of the element, which must be changed\nand 1 \u2264 xi \u2264 10^9 is the new value. Output For each query of the first type\noutput a single integer \u2014 the Mex of c0, c1, ..., c10^9. Example Input 10 4\n1 2 3 1 1 2 2 2 9 9 1 1 1 1 2 8 2 7 1 1 2 8 Output 2 3 2 Note The subarray of\nthe first query consists of the single element \u2014 1. The subarray of the second\nquery consists of four 2s, one 3 and two 1s. The subarray of the fourth query\nconsists of three 1s, three 2s and one 3.\n\n",
