        "description": "Berland National Library has recently been built in the capital of Berland. In\naddition, in the library you can take any of the collected works of Berland\nleaders, the library has a reading room. Today was the pilot launch of an\nautomated reading room visitors' accounting system! The scanner of the system\nis installed at the entrance to the reading room. It records the events of the\nform \"reader entered room\", \"reader left room\". Every reader is assigned a\nregistration number during the registration procedure at the library \u2014 it's a\nunique integer from 1 to 10^6. Thus, the system logs events of two forms: \"+\nri\" \u2014 the reader with registration number ri entered the room; \"- ri\" \u2014 the\nreader with registration number ri left the room. The first launch of the\nsystem was a success, it functioned for some period of time, and, at the time\nof its launch and at the time of its shutdown, the reading room may already\nhave visitors. Significant funds of the budget of Berland have been spent on\nthe design and installation of the system. Therefore, some of the citizens of\nthe capital now demand to explain the need for this system and the benefits\nthat its implementation will bring. Now, the developers of the system need to\nurgently come up with reasons for its existence. Help the system developers to\nfind the minimum possible capacity of the reading room (in visitors) using the\nlog of the system available to you. Input The first line contains a positive\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of records in the system log. Next follow\nn events from the system journal in the order in which the were made. Each\nevent was written on a single line and looks as \"+ ri\" or \"- ri\", where ri is\nan integer from 1 to 10^6, the registration number of the visitor (that is,\ndistinct visitors always have distinct registration numbers). It is guaranteed\nthat the log is not contradictory, that is, for every visitor the types of any\nof his two consecutive events are distinct. Before starting the system, and\nafter stopping the room may possibly contain visitors. Output Print a single\ninteger \u2014 the minimum possible capacity of the reading room. Examples Input 6\n 12001 \u00ad 12001 \u00ad 1 \u00ad 1200  1  7 Output 3 Input 2 \u00ad 1 \u00ad 2 Output 2\nInput 2  1 \u00ad 1 Output 1 Note In the first sample test, the system log will\nensure that at some point in the reading room were visitors with registration\nnumbers 1, 1200 and 12001. More people were not in the room at the same time\nbased on the log. Therefore, the answer to the test is 3.\n\n",
