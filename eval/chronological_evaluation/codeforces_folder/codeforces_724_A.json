        "description": "You are given names of two days of the week. Please, determine whether it is\npossible that during some non-leap year the first day of some month was equal\nto the first day of the week you are given, while the first day of the next\nmonth was equal to the second day of the week you are given. Both months\nshould belong to one year. In this problem, we consider the Gregorian calendar\nto be used. The number of months in this calendar is equal to 12. The number\nof days in months during any non-leap year is: 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31,\n30, 31, 30, 31. Names of the days of the week are given with lowercase English\nletters: \"monday\", \"tuesday\", \"wednesday\", \"thursday\", \"friday\", \"saturday\",\n\"sunday\". Input The input consists of two lines, each of them containing the\nname of exactly one day of the week. It's guaranteed that each string in the\ninput is from the set \"monday\", \"tuesday\", \"wednesday\", \"thursday\", \"friday\",\n\"saturday\", \"sunday\". Output Print \"YES\" (without quotes) if such situation is\npossible during some non-leap year. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\nExamples Input monday tuesday Output NO Input sunday sunday Output YES Input\nsaturday tuesday Output YES Note In the second sample, one can consider\nFebruary 1 and March 1 of year 2015. Both these days were Sundays. In the\nthird sample, one can consider July 1 and August 1 of year 2017. First of\nthese two days is Saturday, while the second one is Tuesday.\n\n",
