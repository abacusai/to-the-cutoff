        "description": "You have \n    n\n distinct points \n    (x_1, y_1),\n    \u2026,(x_n,y_n)\n on the\nplane and a non-negative integer parameter \n    k\n. Each point is a\nmicroscopic steel ball and \n    k\n is the attract power of a ball when it's\ncharged. The attract power is the same for all balls. In one operation, you\ncan select a ball \n    i\n to charge it. Once charged, all balls with Manhattan\ndistance at most \n    k\n from ball \n    i\n move to the position of ball\n\n    i\n. Many balls may have the same coordinate after an operation. More\nformally, for all balls \n    j\n such that \n    |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| \n    \u2264\n    k\n, we assign \n    x_j:=x_i\n and \n    y_j:=y_i\n. An example of an operation.\nAfter charging the ball in the center, two other balls move to its position.\nOn the right side, the red dot in the center is the common position of those\nballs. Your task is to find the minimum number of operations to move all balls\nto the same position, or report that this is impossible. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n,\n\n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number\nof balls and the attract power of all balls, respectively. The following\n\n    n\n lines describe the balls' coordinates. The \n    i\n-th of these lines\ncontains two integers \n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x_i, y_i \n    \u2264 10^5\n)\n\u2014 the coordinates of the \n    i\n-th ball. It is guaranteed that all points are\ndistinct. Output For each test case print a single integer \u2014 the minimum\nnumber of operations to move all balls to the same position, or \n    -1\n if it\nis impossible. Example Input 3 3 2 0 0 3 3 1 1 3 3 6 7 8 8 6 9 4 1 0 0 0 1 0 2\n0 3 Output -1 1 -1 Note In the first test case, there are three balls at\n\n    (0, 0)\n, \n    (3, 3)\n, and \n    (1, 1)\n and the attract power is \n    2\n.\nIt is possible to move two balls together with one operation, but not all\nthree balls together with any number of operations. In the second test case,\nthere are three balls at \n    (6, 7)\n, \n    (8, 8)\n, and \n    (6, 9)\n and the\nattract power is \n    3\n. If we charge any ball, the other two will move to\nthe same position, so we only require one operation. In the third test case,\nthere are four balls at \n    (0, 0)\n, \n    (0, 1)\n, \n    (0, 2)\n, and \n    (0,\n    3)\n, and the attract power is \n    1\n. We can show that it is impossible to\nmove all balls to the same position with a sequence of operations.\n\n",
