        "description": "You are a lover of bacteria. You want to raise some bacteria in a box.\nInitially, the box is empty. Each morning, you can put any number of bacteria\ninto the box. And each night, every bacterium in the box will split into two\nbacteria. You hope to see exactly x bacteria in the box at some moment. What\nis the minimum number of bacteria you need to put into the box across those\ndays? Input The only line containing one integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 10^9). Output The\nonly line containing one integer: the answer. Examples Input 5 Output 2 Input\n8 Output 1 Note For the first sample, we can add one bacterium in the box in\nthe first day morning and at the third morning there will be 4 bacteria in the\nbox. Now we put one more resulting 5 in the box. We added 2 bacteria in the\nprocess so the answer is 2. For the second sample, we can put one in the first\nmorning and in the 4-th morning there will be 8 in the box. So the answer is\n1.\n\n",
