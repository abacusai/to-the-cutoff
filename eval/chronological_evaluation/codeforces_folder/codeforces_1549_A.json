        "description": "Gregor is learning about RSA cryptography, and although he doesn't understand\nhow RSA works, he is now fascinated with prime numbers and factoring them.\nGregor's favorite prime number is \n    P\n. Gregor wants to find two bases of\n\n    P\n. Formally, Gregor is looking for two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n\nwhich satisfy both of the following properties. \n    P \n     a = P \n    \n    b\n, where \n    x \n     y\n denotes the remainder when \n    x\n is divided by\n\n    y\n, and \n    2 \n    \u2264 a < b \n    \u2264 P\n. Help Gregor find two bases of his\nfavorite prime number! Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first\nline contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n).\nEach subsequent line contains the integer \n    P\n (\n    5 \n    \u2264 P \n    \u226410^9\n), with \n    P\n guaranteed to be prime. Output Your output should\nconsist of \n    t\n lines. Each line should consist of two integers \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 a < b \n    \u2264 P\n). If there are multiple possible\nsolutions, print any. Example Input 2 17 5 Output 3 5 2 4 Note The first query\nis \n    P=17\n. \n    a=3\n and \n    b=5\n are valid bases in this case, because\n\n    17 \n     3 = 17 \n     5 = 2\n. There are other pairs which work as\nwell. In the second query, with \n    P=5\n, the only solution is \n    a=2\n and\n\n    b=4\n.\n\n",
