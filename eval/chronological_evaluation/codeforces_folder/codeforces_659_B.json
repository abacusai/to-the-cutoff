        "name": "Qualifying Contest",
        "description": "Very soon Berland will hold a School Team Programming Olympiad. From each of\nthe m Berland regions a team of two people is invited to participate in the\nolympiad. The qualifying contest to form teams was held and it was attended by\nn Berland students. There were at least two schoolboys participating from each\nof the m regions of Berland. The result of each of the participants of the\nqualifying competition is an integer score from 0 to 800 inclusive. The team\nof each region is formed from two such members of the qualifying competition\nof the region, that none of them can be replaced by a schoolboy of the same\nregion, not included in the team and who received a greater number of points.\nThere may be a situation where a team of some region can not be formed\nuniquely, that is, there is more than one school team that meets the\nproperties described above. In this case, the region needs to undertake an\nadditional contest. The two teams in the region are considered to be different\nif there is at least one schoolboy who is included in one team and is not\nincluded in the other team. It is guaranteed that for each region at least two\nits representatives participated in the qualifying contest. Your task is,\ngiven the results of the qualifying competition, to identify the team from\neach region, or to announce that in this region its formation requires\nadditional contests. Input The first line of the input contains two integers n\nand m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10 000, n \u2265 2m) \u2014 the number of participants\nof the qualifying contest and the number of regions in Berland. Next n lines\ncontain the description of the participants of the qualifying contest in the\nfollowing format: Surname (a string of length from 1 to 10 characters and\nconsisting of large and small English letters), region number (integer from 1\nto m) and the number of points scored by the participant (integer from 0 to\n800, inclusive). It is guaranteed that all surnames of all the participants\nare distinct and at least two people participated from each of the m regions.\nThe surnames that only differ in letter cases, should be considered distinct.\nOutput Print m lines. On the i-th line print the team of the i-th region \u2014 the\nsurnames of the two team members in an arbitrary order, or a single character\n\"?\" (without the quotes) if you need to spend further qualifying contests in\nthe region. Examples Input 5 2 Ivanov 1 763 Andreev 2 800 Petrov 1 595 Sidorov\n1 790 Semenov 2 503 Output Sidorov Ivanov Andreev Semenov Input 5 2 Ivanov 1\n800 Andreev 2 763 Petrov 1 800 Sidorov 1 800 Semenov 2 503 Output ? Andreev\nSemenov Note In the first sample region teams are uniquely determined. In the\nsecond sample the team from region 2 is uniquely determined and the team from\nregion 1 can have three teams: \"Petrov\"-\"Sidorov\", \"Ivanov\"-\"Sidorov\",\n\"Ivanov\" -\"Petrov\", so it is impossible to determine a team uniquely.\n\n",
