        "description": "Everyone knows that long ago on the territory of present-day Berland there\nlived Bindian tribes. Their capital was surrounded by n hills, forming a\ncircle. On each hill there was a watchman, who watched the neighbourhood day\nand night. In case of any danger the watchman could make a fire on the hill.\nOne watchman could see the signal of another watchman, if on the circle arc\nconnecting the two hills there was no hill higher than any of the two. As for\nany two hills there are two different circle arcs connecting them, the signal\nwas seen if the above mentioned condition was satisfied on at least one of the\narcs. For example, for any two neighbouring watchmen it is true that the\nsignal of one will be seen by the other. An important characteristics of this\nwatch system was the amount of pairs of watchmen able to see each other's\nsignals. You are to find this amount by the given heights of the hills. Input\nThe first line of the input data contains an integer number n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6),\nn \u2014 the amount of hills around the capital. The second line contains n numbers\n\u2014 heights of the hills in clockwise order. All height numbers are integer and\nlie between 1 and 10^9. Output Print the required amount of pairs. Examples\nInput 5 1 2 4 5 3 Output 7\n\n",
