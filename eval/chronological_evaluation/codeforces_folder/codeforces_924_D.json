        "description": "Arkady the air traffic controller is now working with n planes in the air. All\nplanes move along a straight coordinate axis with Arkady's station being at\npoint 0 on it. The i-th plane, small enough to be represented by a point,\ncurrently has a coordinate of xi and is moving with speed vi. It's guaranteed\nthat xi\u00b7vi < 0, i.e., all planes are moving towards the station. Occasionally,\nthe planes are affected by winds. With a wind of speed vwind (not necessarily\npositive or integral), the speed of the i-th plane becomes vi + vwind.\nAccording to weather report, the current wind has a steady speed falling\ninside the range [ - w, w] (inclusive), but the exact value cannot be measured\naccurately since this value is rather small \u2014 smaller than the absolute value\nof speed of any plane. Each plane should contact Arkady at the exact moment it\npasses above his station. And you are to help Arkady count the number of pairs\nof planes (i, j) (i < j) there are such that there is a possible value of wind\nspeed, under which planes i and j contact Arkady at the same moment. This\nvalue needn't be the same across different pairs. The wind speed is the same\nfor all planes. You may assume that the wind has a steady speed and lasts\narbitrarily long. Input The first line contains two integers n and w (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n100 000, 0 \u2264 w < 10^5) \u2014 the number of planes and the maximum wind speed. The\ni-th of the next n lines contains two integers xi and vi (1 \u2264 |xi| \u2264 10^5, w +\n1 \u2264 |vi| \u2264 10^5, xi\u00b7vi < 0) \u2014 the initial position and speed of the i-th\nplane. Planes are pairwise distinct, that is, no pair of (i, j) (i < j) exists\nsuch that both xi = xj and vi = vj. Output Output a single integer \u2014 the\nnumber of unordered pairs of planes that can contact Arkady at the same\nmoment. Examples Input 5 1 -3 2 -3 3 -1 2 1 -3 3 -5 Output 3 Input 6 1 -3 2 -2\n2 -1 2 1 -2 2 -2 3 -2 Output 9 Note In the first example, the following 3\npairs of planes satisfy the requirements: (2, 5) passes the station at time 3\n/ 4 with vwind = 1; (3, 4) passes the station at time 2 / 5 with vwind = 1 /\n2; (3, 5) passes the station at time 4 / 7 with vwind = - 1 / 4. In the second\nexample, each of the 3 planes with negative coordinates can form a valid pair\nwith each of the other 3, totaling 9 pairs.\n\n",
