        "description": "Let's say that two strings \n    s\n and \n    t\n rhyme if both strings have\nlength at least \n    k\n, and their last \n    k\n characters are equal. For\nexample, if \n    k = 3\n, the strings abcd and cebcd rhyme, the strings ab and\nab don't rhyme, the strings aaaa and aaaaa rhyme, the strings abcd and abce\ndon't rhyme. You have \n    n\n pairs of strings \n    (s_i, t_i)\n, and for each\npair of strings you know, should they rhyme or should not. Find all possible\nnon-negative integer values for \n    k\n such that pairs that have to rhyme,\nrhyme and pairs that must not rhyme, don't rhyme. Input Each test contains\nmultiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n). Description of the test cases follows. The first\nline of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of string pairs. Next \n    n\n lines contains\ndescriptions of pairs \u2014 one per line. The \n    i\n-th line contains space-\nseparated strings \n    s_i\n and \n    t_i\n and marker \n    r_i\n. Strings are\nnon-empty, consist of lowercase Latin letters and each have length at most\n\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. The marker \n    r_i\n equals to \n    1\n if strings have\nto rhyme, or \n    0\n if they must not rhyme. It's guaranteed that for each\ntest case there is at least one pair with \n    r_i\n equal to \n    1\n and that\nthe total length of all strings over all test cases doesn't exceed \n    4\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, firstly print integer \n    m\n \u2014\nthe number of possible non-negative integer values of \n    k\n such that pairs\nthat have to rhyme, rhyme and pairs that must not rhyme, don't rhyme. Next,\nprint all these values of \n    k\n (without repetitions). You can print them in\nany order. Example Input 3 1 kotlin heroes 1 2 join kotlin 1 episode eight 0 4\nabc abcdef 0 xyz zzz 1 aaa bba 0 c d 0 Output 1 0 2 1 2 0 Note In the first\ntest case, if \n    k\n is at least \n    1\n then kotlin and heroes don't rhyme.\nIn the second test case, for \n    k = 2\n join and kotlin rhyme, and episode\nand eight don't rhyme.\n\n",
