        "description": "Fafa owns a company that works on huge projects. There are n employees in\nFafa's company. Whenever the company has a new project to start working on,\nFafa has to divide the tasks of this project among all the employees. Fafa\nfinds doing this every time is very tiring for him. So, he decided to choose\nthe best l employees in his company as team leaders. Whenever there is a new\nproject, Fafa will divide the tasks among only the team leaders and each team\nleader will be responsible of some positive number of employees to give them\nthe tasks. To make this process fair for the team leaders, each one of them\nshould be responsible for the same number of employees. Moreover, every\nemployee, who is not a team leader, has to be under the responsibility of\nexactly one team leader, and no team leader is responsible for another team\nleader. Given the number of employees n, find in how many ways Fafa could\nchoose the number of team leaders l in such a way that it is possible to\ndivide employees between them evenly. Input The input consists of a single\nline containing a positive integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of employees\nin Fafa's company. Output Print a single integer representing the answer to\nthe problem. Examples Input 2 Output 1 Input 10 Output 3 Note In the second\nsample Fafa has 3 ways: choose only 1 employee as a team leader with 9\nemployees under his responsibility. choose 2 employees as team leaders with 4\nemployees under the responsibility of each of them. choose 5 employees as team\nleaders with 1 employee under the responsibility of each of them.\n\n",
