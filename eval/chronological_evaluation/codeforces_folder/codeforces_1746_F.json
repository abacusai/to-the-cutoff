        "description": "You have an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n positive integers and you have\nto handle \n    q\n queries of the following types: \n    1\n \n    i\n \n    x\n:\nchange \n    a_i\n to \n    x\n, \n    2\n \n    l\n \n    r\n \n    k\n: check if the\nnumber of occurrences of every positive integer in the subarray \n    a_l,\n    a_l+1, \n    \u2026 a_r\n is a multiple of \n    k\n (check the example for\nbetter understanding). Input The first line of the input contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n , q \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n), the length of\n\n    a\n and the number of queries. Next line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026 a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the\nelements of \n    a\n. Each of the next \n    q\n lines describes a query. It has\none of the following forms. \n    1\n \n    i\n \n    x\n, (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^9\n), or \n    2\n \n    l\n \n    r\n \n    k\n, (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n , \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n). Output For each query of the\nsecond type, if answer of the query is yes, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\".\nExample Input 10 8 1234 2 3 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 2 1 6 2 1 1 1 2 1 6 2 2 1 9 2 1 10 5\n2 1 9 3 1 3 5 2 3 10 2 Output NO YES NO YES YES Note In the first query,\nrequested subarray is \n    [1234, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]\n, and it's obvious that the\nnumber of occurrence of \n    1\n isn't divisible by \n    k = 2\n. So the answer\nis \"NO\". In the third query, requested subarray is \n    [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]\n,\nand it can be seen that the number of occurrence of every integer in this sub\narray is divisible by \n    k = 2\n. So the answer is \"YES\". In the sixth query,\nrequested subarray is \n    [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n, and it can be seen\nthat the number of occurrence of every integer in this sub array is divisible\nby \n    k = 3\n. So the answer is \"YES\".\n\n",
