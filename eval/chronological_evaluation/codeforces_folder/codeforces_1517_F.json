        "description": "It is reported that the 2050 Conference will be held in Yunqi Town in Hangzhou\nfrom April 23 to 25, including theme forums, morning jogging, camping and so\non. The relationship between the \n    n\n volunteers of the 2050 Conference can\nbe represented by a tree (a connected undirected graph with \n    n\n vertices\nand \n    n-1\n edges). The \n    n\n vertices of the tree corresponds to the\n\n    n\n volunteers and are numbered by \n    1,2,\n    \u2026, n\n. We define the\ndistance between two volunteers \n    i\n and \n    j\n, dis\n    (i,j)\n as the\nnumber of edges on the shortest path from vertex \n    i\n to vertex \n    j\n on\nthe tree. dis\n    (i,j)=0\n whenever \n    i=j\n. Some of the volunteers can\nattend the on-site reunion while others cannot. If for some volunteer \n    x\n\nand nonnegative integer \n    r\n, all volunteers whose distance to \n    x\n is\nno more than \n    r\n can attend the on-site reunion, a forum with radius\n\n    r\n can take place. The level of the on-site reunion is defined as the\nmaximum possible radius of any forum that can take place. Assume that each\nvolunteer can attend the on-site reunion with probability \n    1/2\n\nand these events are independent. Output the expected level of the on-site\nreunion. When no volunteer can attend, the level is defined as \n    -1\n. When\nall volunteers can attend, the level is defined as \n    n\n. Input The first\nline contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 300\n) denoting the\nnumber of volunteers. Each of the next \n    n-1\n lines contains two integers\n\n    a\n and \n    b\n denoting an edge between vertex \n    a\n and vertex\n\n    b\n. Output Output the expected level modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n.\nFormally, let \n    M = 998\n     244\n     353\n. It can be shown that the answer can\nbe expressed as an irreducible fraction \n    p/q\n, where \n    p\n and\n\n    q\n are integers and \n    q \n    \u2261 0 \n    M\n. Output the\ninteger equal to \n    p \n    \u00b7 q^-1\n     M\n. In other words, output such\nan integer \n    x\n that \n    0 \n    \u2264 x < M\n and \n    x \n    \u00b7 q \n    \u2261 p\n    \n    M\n. Examples Input 3 1 2 2 3 Output 499122177 Input 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 3\n5 Output 249561089 Input 10 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 10 Output\n821796866 Note For the first example, the following table shows all possible\noutcomes. \n    yes\n means the volunteer can attend the on-site reunion and\n\n    no\n means he cannot attend. \n    \n\n    [     1     2     3 level; ; ;   yes   yes   yes     3; ; ;   yes   yes    no     1; ; ;   yes    no   yes     0; ; ;   yes    no    no     0; ; ;    no   yes   yes     1; ; ;    no   yes    no     0; ; ;    no    no   yes     0; ; ;    no    no    no    -1; ; ;      ;  ]\n\n    \n The expected level is\n\n    3+1+1+(-1)/2^3=\n    1/2\n.\n\n",
