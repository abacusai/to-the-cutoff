        "description": "\n    n\n students attended the first meeting of the Berland SU programming\ncourse (\n    n\n is even). All students will be divided into two groups. Each\ngroup will be attending exactly one lesson each week during one of the five\nworking days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday), and the days\nchosen for the groups must be different. Furthermore, both groups should\ncontain the same number of students. Each student has filled a survey in which\nthey told which days of the week are convenient for them to attend a lesson,\nand which are not. Your task is to determine if it is possible to choose two\ndifferent week days to schedule the lessons for the group (the first group\nwill attend the lesson on the first chosen day, the second group will attend\nthe lesson on the second chosen day), and divide the students into two groups,\nso the groups have equal sizes, and for each student, the chosen lesson day\nfor their group is convenient. Input The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of testcases. Then the\ndescriptions of \n    t\n testcases follow. The first line of each testcase\ncontains one integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of\nstudents. The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    n\n lines contains \n    5\n integers,\neach of them is \n    0\n or \n    1\n. If the \n    j\n-th integer is \n    1\n, then\nthe \n    i\n-th student can attend the lessons on the \n    j\n-th day of the\nweek. If the \n    j\n-th integer is \n    0\n, then the \n    i\n-th student cannot\nattend the lessons on the \n    j\n-th day of the week. Additional constraints\non the input: for each student, at least one of the days of the week is\nconvenient, the total number of students over all testcases doesn't exceed\n\n    10^5\n. Output For each testcase print an answer. If it's possible to\ndivide the students into two groups of equal sizes and choose different days\nfor the groups so each student can attend the lesson in the chosen day of\ntheir group, print \"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without\nquotes). Example Input 2 4 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0 Output YES NO Note In the first testcase, there is a way to meet all\nthe constraints. For example, the first group can consist of the first and the\nthird students, they will attend the lessons on Thursday (the fourth day); the\nsecond group can consist of the second and the fourth students, and they will\nattend the lessons on Tuesday (the second day). In the second testcase, it is\nimpossible to divide the students into groups so they attend the lessons on\ndifferent days.\n\n",
