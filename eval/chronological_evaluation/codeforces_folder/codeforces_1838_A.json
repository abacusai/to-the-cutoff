        "description": "Two integers were written on a blackboard. After that, the following step was\ncarried out \n    n-2\n times: Select any two integers on the board, and write\nthe absolute value of their difference on the board. After this process was\ncomplete, the list of \n    n\n integers was shuffled. You are given the final\nlist. Recover one of the initial two numbers. You do not need to recover the\nother one. You are guaranteed that the input can be generated using the above\nprocess. Input The first line of the input contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the\ntest cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the size of the final list. The next\nline of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026 a_n\n\n(\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the shuffled list of numbers written on\nthe blackboard. It is guaranteed that the input was generated using the\nprocess described above. Output For each test case, output a single integer\n\n    x\n \u2014 one of the two initial numbers on the blackboard. If there are\nmultiple solutions, print any of them. Example Input 9 3 9 2 7 3 15 -4 11 4 -9\n1 11 -10 5 3 0 0 0 3 7 8 16 8 0 8 16 8 4 0 0 0 0 10 27 1 24 28 2 -1 26 25 28\n27 6 600000000 800000000 0 -200000000 1000000000 800000000 3 0 -1000000000\n1000000000 Output 9 11 -9 3 8 0 -1 600000000 0 Note For the first test case,\n\n    a\n can be produced by starting with either \n    9\n and \n    2\n, and then\nwriting down \n    |9-2|=7\n, or starting with \n    9\n and \n    7\n and writing\ndown \n    |9-7|=2\n. So \n    2\n, \n    7\n, and \n    9\n are all valid answers,\nbecause they all appear in at least one valid pair. For the second test case,\nwe can show that the two initial numbers must have been \n    -4\n and \n    11\n.\nFor the fourth test case, the starting numbers could have been either \n    3\n\nand \n    3\n, or \n    3\n and \n    0\n, so \n    3\n and \n    0\n are both valid\nanswers. For the fifth test case, we can show that the starting numbers were\n\n    8\n and \n    16\n.\n\n",
