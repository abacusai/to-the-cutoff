        "name": "Fix a Tree",
        "description": "A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles. Let's consider a\nrooted undirected tree with n vertices, numbered 1 through n. There are many\nways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with n integers\np1, p2, ..., pn, where pi denotes a parent of vertex i (here, for convenience\na root is considered its own parent). For this rooted tree the array p is [2,\n3, 3, 2]. Given a sequence p1, p2, ..., pn, one is able to restore a tree:\nThere must be exactly one index r that pr = r. A vertex r is a root of the\ntree. For all other n - 1 vertices i, there is an edge between vertex i and\nvertex pi. A sequence p1, p2, ..., pn is called valid if the described\nprocedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for n = 3 sequences\n(1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid. You are given a sequence a1, a2,\n..., an, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of\nelements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of\nchanges and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If\nthere are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes,\nprint any of them. Input The first line of the input contains an integer n (2\n\u2264 n \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number of vertices in the tree. The second line contains\nn integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 n). Output In the first line print the\nminimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence. In the\nsecond line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a1, a2, ..., an)\nin the minimum number of changes. If there are many such sequences, any of\nthem will be accepted. Examples Input 4 2 3 3 4 Output 1 2 3 4 4 Input 5 3 2 2\n5 3 Output 0 3 2 2 5 3 Input 8 2 3 5 4 1 6 6 7 Output 2 2 3 7 8 1 6 6 7 Note\nIn the first sample, it's enough to change one element. In the provided\noutput, a sequence represents a tree rooted in a vertex 4 (because p4 = 4),\nwhich you can see on the left drawing below. One of other correct solutions\nwould be a sequence 2 3 3 2, representing a tree rooted in vertex 3 (right\ndrawing below). On both drawings, roots are painted red. In the second sample,\nthe given sequence is already valid.\n\n",
