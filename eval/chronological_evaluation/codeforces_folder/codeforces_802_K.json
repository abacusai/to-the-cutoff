        "description": "Thank you for helping Heidi! It is now the second of April, but she has been\nsummoned by Jenny again. The pranks do not seem to end... In the meantime,\nHeidi has decided that she does not trust her friends anymore. Not too much,\nanyway. Her relative lack of trust is manifested as follows: whereas\npreviously she would not be made to visit the same person twice, now she can\nonly be sure that she will not be made to visit the same person more than k\ntimes. (In the case of Jenny, this includes her first visit in the beginning.\nThe situation from the easy version corresponds to setting k = 1.) This is not\nas bad as it looks, since a single ticket for a route between two friends\nallows Heidi to travel between this pair of friends the whole day (in both\ndirections). In other words, once she pays for travel between a pair of\nfriends, all further travels between that pair are free. How much money will\nHeidi waste now, in a worst-case scenario? Input The first line contains two\nspace-separated integers \u2013 the number of friends n () and the parameter k (1 \u2264\nk \u2264 10^5). The next n - 1 lines each contain three space-separated integers u,\nv and c (0 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n - 1, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 10^4) meaning that u and v are friends and\nthe cost for traveling between u and v is c. It is again guaranteed that the\nsocial network of the input forms a tree. Output Again, output a single\ninteger \u2013 the maximum sum of costs of tickets. Examples Input 9 3 0 1 1 0 2 1\n1 3 2 1 4 2 1 5 2 2 6 3 2 7 3 2 8 3 Output 15 Input 9 5 0 1 1 0 2 1 1 3 2 1 4\n2 1 5 2 2 6 3 2 7 3 2 8 3 Output 17 Input 11 6 1 0 7932 2 1 1952 3 2 2227 4 0\n9112 5 4 6067 6 0 6786 7 6 3883 8 4 7137 9 1 2796 10 5 6200 Output 54092 Note\nIn the first example, the worst-case scenario for Heidi is to visit the\nfriends in the following order: 0, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 6, 2, 7, 2, 8. Observe\nthat no friend is visited more than 3 times.\n\n",
