        "description": "Recently, the students of School 179 have developed a unique algorithm, which\ntakes in a binary string \n    s\n as input. However, they soon found out that\nif some substring \n    t\n of \n    s\n is a palindrome of length greater than 1,\nthe algorithm will work incorrectly. Can the students somehow reorder the\ncharacters of \n    s\n so that the algorithm will work correctly on the string?\nA binary string is a string where each character is either 0 or 1. A string\n\n    a\n is a substring of a string \n    b\n if \n    a\n can be obtained from\n\n    b\n by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the\nbeginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end. A\npalindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards. Input Each\ntest contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test\ncases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n). Description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the length of the string \n    s\n. The second\nline of each test case contains the string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n\nconsisting only of the characters 0 and 1. Output For each test case, print\nYES (case-insensitive) if it is possible to reorder the characters of \n    s\n\nso that there are no substrings that are a palindrome of length greater than\n1, or NO (case-insensitive) otherwise. Example Input 4 1 1 2 10 2 01 4 1010\nOutput YES YES YES NO Note In the first three test cases, the given strings do\nnot contain palindromes of length greater than 1, so the answers are YES. In\nthe last test case, it is impossible to reorder the characters so that the\nstring does not contain palindromes of length greater than 1, so the answer is\nNO.\n\n",
