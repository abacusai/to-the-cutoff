        "description": "Alex has bought a new novel that was published in \n    n\n volumes. He has read\nthese volumes one by one, and each volume has taken him several (maybe one)\nfull days to read. So, on the first day, he was reading the first volume, and\non each of the following days, he was reading either the same volume he had\nbeen reading on the previous day, or the next volume. Let \n    v_i\n be the\nnumber of the volume Alex was reading on the \n    i\n-th day. Here are some\nexamples: one of the possible situations is \n    v_1 = 1\n, \n    v_2 = 1\n,\n\n    v_3 = 2\n, \n    v_4 = 3\n, \n    v_5 = 3\n \u2014 this situation means that Alex\nhas spent two days (\n    1\n-st and \n    2\n-nd) on the first volume, one day\n(\n    3\n-rd) on the second volume, and two days (\n    4\n-th and \n    5\n-th) on\nthe third volume; a situation \n    v_1 = 2\n, \n    v_2 = 2\n, \n    v_3 = 3\n is\nimpossible, since Alex started with the first volume (so \n    v_1\n cannot be\nanything but \n    1\n); a situation \n    v_1 = 1\n, \n    v_2 = 2\n, \n    v_3 =\n    3\n, \n    v_4 = 1\n is impossible, since Alex won't return to the first volume\nafter reading the third one; a situation \n    v_1 = 1\n, \n    v_2 = 3\n is\nimpossible, since Alex doesn't skip volumes. You know that Alex was reading\nthe volume \n    v_a\n on the day \n    a\n, and the volume \n    v_c\n on the day\n\n    c\n. Now you want to guess which volume was he reading on the day \n    b\n,\nwhich is between the days \n    a\n and \n    c\n (so \n    a < b < c\n). There may\nbe some ambiguity, so you want to make any valid guess (i. e. choose some\nvolume number \n    v_b\n so it's possible that Alex was reading volume\n\n    v_a\n on day \n    a\n, volume \n    v_b\n on day \n    b\n, and volume\n\n    v_c\n on day \n    c\n). Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The\nfirst line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    100\n). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test\ncase contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of volumes the novel consists of. The second line of each test case\ncontains two integers \n    a\n and \n    v_a\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a \n    \u2264 98\n; \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 v_a \n    \u2264 a\n) denoting that Alex was reading volume \n    v_a\n at day\n\n    a\n. The third line of each test case contains two integers \n    c\n and\n\n    v_c\n (\n    a + 2 \n    \u2264 c \n    \u2264 100\n; \n    v_a \n    \u2264 v_c \n    \u2264 c\n)\ndenoting that Alex was reading volume \n    v_c\n at day \n    c\n. The fourth\nline of each test case contains one integer \n    b\n (\n    a < b < c\n) \u2014 the\nday you are interested in. It's guaranteed that the input is not\ncontroversial, in other words, Alex could read volume \n    v_a\n at day \n    a\n\nand volume \n    v_c\n at day \n    c\n. Output For each test case, print the\npossible index of volume Alex could read at day \n    b\n. If there are multiple\nanswers, print any. Example Input 4 1 1 1 100 1 99 4 10 1 20 4 16 100 1 1 100\n100 42 100 1 1 100 2 99 Output 1 2 42 1 Note In the first test case, since\nAlex was reading volume \n    1\n both at day \n    1\n and at day \n    100\n then\nhe was reading volume \n    1\n at any day between them. In the second test\ncase, Alex could read any volume from \n    1\n to \n    4\n at day \n    16\n. For\nexample, he could read volume \n    1\n from day \n    1\n to day \n    15\n, volume\n\n    2\n at days \n    16\n and \n    17\n, volume \n    3\n at day \n    18\n and\nvolume \n    4\n at days \n    19\n and \n    20\n. In the third test case, there is\nonly one possible situation: Alex read one volume per day, so at day \n    42\n\nhe read volume \n    42\n.\n\n",
