        "description": "The Berland language consists of words having exactly two letters. Moreover,\nthe first letter of a word is different from the second letter. Any\ncombination of two different Berland letters (which, by the way, are the same\nas the lowercase letters of Latin alphabet) is a correct word in Berland\nlanguage. The Berland dictionary contains all words of this language. The\nwords are listed in a way they are usually ordered in dictionaries. Formally,\nword \n    a\n comes earlier than word \n    b\n in the dictionary if one of the\nfollowing conditions hold: the first letter of \n    a\n is less than the first\nletter of \n    b\n; the first letters of \n    a\n and \n    b\n are the same, and\nthe second letter of \n    a\n is less than the second letter of \n    b\n. So,\nthe dictionary looks like that: Word \n    1\n: ab Word \n    2\n: ac ... Word\n\n    25\n: az Word \n    26\n: ba Word \n    27\n: bc ... Word \n    649\n: zx Word\n\n    650\n: zy You are given a word \n    s\n from the Berland language. Your\ntask is to find its index in the dictionary. Input The first line contains one\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 650\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each\ntest case consists of one line containing \n    s\n \u2014 a string consisting of\nexactly two different lowercase Latin letters (i. e. a correct word of the\nBerland language). Output For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the index of\nthe word \n    s\n in the dictionary. Example Input 7 ab ac az ba bc zx zy\nOutput 1 2 25 26 27 649 650\n\n",
