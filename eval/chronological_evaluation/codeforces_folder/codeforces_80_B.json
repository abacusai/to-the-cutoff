        "description": "Do you remember a kind cartoon \"Beauty and the Beast\"? No, no, there was no\nfiring from machine guns or radiation mutants time-travels! There was a beauty\nnamed Belle. Once she had violated the Beast's order and visited the West\nWing. After that she was banished from the castle... Everybody was upset. The\nbeautiful Belle was upset, so was the Beast, so was Lumiere the candlestick.\nBut the worst thing was that Cogsworth was upset. Cogsworth is not a human,\nbut is the mantel clock, which was often used as an alarm clock. Due to\nCogsworth's frustration all the inhabitants of the castle were in trouble: now\nthey could not determine when it was time to drink morning tea, and when it\nwas time for an evening stroll. Fortunately, deep in the basement are lying\ndigital clock showing the time in the format HH:MM. Now the residents of the\ncastle face a difficult task. They should turn Cogsworth's hour and minute\nmustache hands in such a way, that Cogsworth began to show the correct time.\nMoreover they need to find turn angles in degrees for each mustache hands. The\ninitial time showed by Cogsworth is 12:00. You can only rotate the hands\nforward, that is, as is shown in the picture: As since there are many ways too\nselect such angles because of full rotations, choose the smallest angles in\nthe right (non-negative) direction. Note that Cogsworth's hour and minute\nmustache hands move evenly and continuously. Hands are moving independently,\nso when turning one hand the other hand remains standing still. Input The only\nline of input contains current time according to the digital clock, formatted\nas HH:MM (00 \u2264 HH \u2264 23, 00 \u2264 MM \u2264 59). The mantel clock initially shows 12:00.\nPretests contain times of the beginning of some morning TV programs of the\nChannel One Russia. Output Print two numbers x and y \u2014 the angles of turning\nthe hour and minute hands, respectively (0 \u2264 x, y < 360). The absolute or\nrelative error in the answer should not exceed 10^-9. Examples Input 12:00\nOutput 0 0 Input 04:30 Output 135 180 Input 08:17 Output 248.5 102 Note A note\nto the second example: the hour hand will be positioned exactly in the middle,\nbetween 4 and 5.\n\n",
