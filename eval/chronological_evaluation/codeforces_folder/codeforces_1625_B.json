        "description": "Martians are actively engaged in interplanetary trade. Olymp City, the Martian\ncity known for its spaceport, has become a place where goods from all the\ncorners of our Galaxy come. To deliver even more freight from faraway planets,\nMartians need fast spaceships. A group of scientists conducts experiments to\nbuild a fast engine for the new spaceship. In the current experiment, there\nare \n    n\n elementary particles, the \n    i\n-th of them has type \n    a_i\n.\nDenote a subsegment of the particle sequence (\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n) as\na sequence (\n    a_l, a_l+1, \n    \u2026, a_r\n) for some left bound \n    l\n and\nright bound \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n). For instance, the\nsequence \n    (1\n     4\n     2\n     8\n     5\n     7)\n for \n    l=2\n and \n    r=4\n has\nthe sequence \n    (4\n     2\n     8)\n as a subsegment. Two subsegments are\nconsidered different if at least one bound of those subsegments differs. Note\nthat the subsegments can be equal as sequences but still considered different.\nFor example, consider the sequence \n    (1\n     1\n     1\n     1\n     1)\n and two of\nits subsegments: one with \n    l=1\n and \n    r=3\n and another with \n    l=2\n\nand \n    r=4\n. Both subsegments are equal to \n    (1\n     1\n     1)\n, but still\nconsidered different, as their left and right bounds differ. The scientists\nwant to conduct a reaction to get two different subsegments of the same\nlength. Denote this length \n    k\n. The resulting pair of subsegments must be\nharmonious, i. e. for some \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 k\n) it must be true\nthat the types of particles on the \n    i\n-th position are the same for these\ntwo subsegments. For example, the pair \n    (1\n     7\n     3)\n and \n    (4\n     7\n    8)\n is harmonious, as both subsegments have \n    7\n on the second position.\nThe pair \n    (1\n     2\n     3)\n and \n    (3\n     1\n     2)\n is not harmonious. The\nlonger are harmonious subsegments, the more chances for the scientists to\ndesign a fast engine. So, they asked you to calculate the maximal possible\nlength of harmonious pair made of different subsegments. Input The first line\ncontains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. The following are descriptions of the test cases. The first line\ncontains an integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 150\n     000\n) \u2014 the amount of\nelementary particles in the sequence. The second line contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 150\n     000\n) \u2014 types of elementary\nparticles. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does\nnot exceed \n    3\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For each test, print a single integer,\nmaximal possible length of harmonious pair made of different subsegments. If\nsuch pair does not exist, print \n    -1\n instead. Example Input 4 7 3 1 5 2 1\n3 4 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 4 2 8 5 7 2 15 15 Output 4 5 -1 1 Note The first test\ncase is shown on the picture below: As you can see from it, you may choose the\nsubsegments \n    (2\n     1\n     3\n     4)\n and \n    (3\n     1\n     5\n     2)\n, which are a\nharmonious pair. Their length is equal to \n    4\n, so the answer is \n    4\n.\nIn the second test case, you need to take two subsegments: one with \n    l=1\n\nand \n    r=5\n, and one with \n    l=2\n and \n    r=6\n. It's not hard to observe\nthat these segments are a harmonious pair and considered different even though\nthey are both equal to \n    (1\n     1\n     1\n     1\n     1)\n. In the third test case,\nyou cannot make a harmonious pair, so the answer is \n    -1\n.\n\n",
