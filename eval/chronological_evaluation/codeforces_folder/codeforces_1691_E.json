        "description": "You are given \n    n\n colored segments on the number line. Each segment is\neither colored red or blue. The \n    i\n-th segment can be represented by a\ntuple \n    (c_i, l_i, r_i)\n. The segment contains all the points in the range\n\n    [l_i, r_i]\n, inclusive, and its color denoted by \n    c_i\n: if \n    c_i =\n    0\n, it is a red segment; if \n    c_i = 1\n, it is a blue segment. We say that\ntwo segments of different colors are connected, if they share at least one\ncommon point. Two segments belong to the same group, if they are either\nconnected directly, or through a sequence of directly connected segments. Find\nthe number of groups of segments. Input Each test contains multiple test\ncases. The first line contains the number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n). Description of the test cases follows. The first line of each\ntest case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014\nthe number of segments. Each of the next \n    n\n lines contains three integers\n\n    c_i, l_i, r_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 1, 0 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n), describing the \n    i\n-th segment. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test\ncase, print a single integer \n    k\n, the number of groups of segments.\nExample Input 2 5 0 0 5 1 2 12 0 4 7 1 9 16 0 13 19 3 1 0 1 1 1 2 0 3 4 Output\n2 3 Note In the first example there are \n    5\n segments. The segments \n    1\n\nand \n    2\n are connected, because they are of different colors and share a\npoint. Also, the segments \n    2\n and \n    3\n are connected, and so are\nsegments \n    4\n and \n    5\n. Thus, there are two groups: one containing\nsegments \n    1, 2, 3\n, and the other one containing segments\n\n    4, 5\n.\n\n",
