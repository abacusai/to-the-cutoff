        "name": "Dima and Trap Graph",
        "description": "Dima and Inna love spending time together. The problem is, Seryozha isn't too\nenthusiastic to leave his room for some reason. But Dima and Inna love each\nother so much that they decided to get criminal... Dima constructed a trap\ngraph. He shouted: \"Hey Seryozha, have a look at my cool graph!\" to get his\nroommate interested and kicked him into the first node. A trap graph is an\nundirected graph consisting of n nodes and m edges. For edge number k, Dima\ndenoted a range of integers from lk to rk (lk \u2264 rk). In order to get out of\nthe trap graph, Seryozha initially (before starting his movements) should pick\nsome integer (let's call it x), then Seryozha must go some way from the\nstarting node with number 1 to the final node with number n. At that, Seryozha\ncan go along edge k only if lk \u2264 x \u2264 rk. Seryozha is a mathematician. He\ndefined the loyalty of some path from the 1-st node to the n-th one as the\nnumber of integers x, such that if he initially chooses one of them, he passes\nthe whole path. Help Seryozha find the path of maximum loyalty and return to\nhis room as quickly as possible! Input The first line of the input contains\ntwo integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^3, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 3\u00b710^3). Then follow m lines\ndescribing the edges. Each line contains four integers ak, bk, lk and rk (1 \u2264\nak, bk \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 lk \u2264 rk \u2264 10^6). The numbers mean that in the trap graph the\nk-th edge connects nodes ak and bk, this edge corresponds to the range of\nintegers from lk to rk. Note that the given graph can have loops and multiple\nedges. Output In a single line of the output print an integer \u2014 the maximum\nloyalty among all paths from the first node to the n-th one. If such paths do\nnot exist or the maximum loyalty equals 0, print in a single line \"Nice work,\nDima!\" without the quotes. Examples Input 4 4 1 2 1 10 2 4 3 5 1 3 1 5 2 4 2 7\nOutput 6 Input 5 6 1 2 1 10 2 5 11 20 1 4 2 5 1 3 10 11 3 4 12 10000 4 5 6 6\nOutput Nice work, Dima! Note Explanation of the first example. Overall, we\nhave 2 ways to get from node 1 to node 4: first you must go along the edge 1-2\nwith range [1-10], then along one of the two edges 2-4. One of them contains\nrange [3-5], that is, we can pass through with numbers 3, 4, 5. So the loyalty\nof such path is 3. If we go along edge 2-4 with range [2-7], then we can pass\nthrough with numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The loyalty is 6. That is the answer.\nThe edge 1-2 have no influence on the answer because its range includes both\nranges of the following edges.\n\n",
