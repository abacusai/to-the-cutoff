        "description": "A bus moves along the coordinate line Ox from the point x = 0 to the point x =\na. After starting from the point x = 0, it reaches the point x = a,\nimmediately turns back and then moves to the point x = 0. After returning to\nthe point x = 0 it immediately goes back to the point x = a and so on. Thus,\nthe bus moves from x = 0 to x = a and back. Moving from the point x = 0 to x =\na or from the point x = a to x = 0 is called a bus journey. In total, the bus\nmust make k journeys. The petrol tank of the bus can hold b liters of\ngasoline. To pass a single unit of distance the bus needs to spend exactly one\nliter of gasoline. The bus starts its first journey with a full petrol tank.\nThere is a gas station in point x = f. This point is between points x = 0 and\nx = a. There are no other gas stations on the bus route. While passing by a\ngas station in either direction the bus can stop and completely refuel its\ntank. Thus, after stopping to refuel the tank will contain b liters of\ngasoline. What is the minimum number of times the bus needs to refuel at the\npoint x = f to make k journeys? The first journey starts in the point x = 0.\nInput The first line contains four integers a, b, f, k (0 < f < a \u2264 10^6, 1 \u2264\nb \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the endpoint of the first bus journey, the capacity\nof the fuel tank of the bus, the point where the gas station is located, and\nthe required number of journeys. Output Print the minimum number of times the\nbus needs to refuel to make k journeys. If it is impossible for the bus to\nmake k journeys, print -1. Examples Input 6 9 2 4 Output 4 Input 6 10 2 4\nOutput 2 Input 6 5 4 3 Output -1 Note In the first example the bus needs to\nrefuel during each journey. In the second example the bus can pass 10 units of\ndistance without refueling. So the bus makes the whole first journey, passes 4\nunits of the distance of the second journey and arrives at the point with the\ngas station. Then it can refuel its tank, finish the second journey and pass 2\nunits of distance from the third journey. In this case, it will again arrive\nat the point with the gas station. Further, he can refill the tank up to 10\nliters to finish the third journey and ride all the way of the fourth journey.\nAt the end of the journey the tank will be empty. In the third example the bus\ncan not make all 3 journeys because if it refuels during the second journey,\nthe tanks will contain only 5 liters of gasoline, but the bus needs to pass 8\nunits of distance until next refueling.\n\n",
