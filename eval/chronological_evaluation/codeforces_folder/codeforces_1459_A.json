        "description": "There are \n    n\n cards numbered \n    1, \n    \u2026, n\n. The card \n    i\n has a\nred digit \n    r_i\n and a blue digit \n    b_i\n written on it. We arrange all\n\n    n\n cards in random order from left to right, with all permutations of\n\n    1, \n    \u2026, n\n having the same probability. We then read all red digits\non the cards from left to right, and obtain an integer \n    R\n. In the same\nway, we read all blue digits and obtain an integer \n    B\n. When reading a\nnumber, leading zeros can be ignored. If all digits in a number are zeros,\nthen the number is equal to \n    0\n. Below is an illustration of a possible\nrearrangement of three cards, and how \n    R\n and \n    B\n can be found. Two\nplayers, Red and Blue, are involved in a bet. Red bets that after the shuffle\n\n    R > B\n, and Blue bets that \n    R < B\n. If in the end \n    R = B\n, the\nbet results in a draw, and neither player wins. Determine, which of the two\nplayers is more likely (has higher probability) to win the bet, or that their\nchances are equal. Refer to the Note section for a formal discussion of\ncomparing probabilities. Input The first line contains a single integer\n\n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Descriptions\nof \n    T\n test cases follow. Each test case description starts with a line\ncontaining a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of cards. The following line contains a string of \n    n\n digits\n\n    r_1, \n    \u2026, r_n\n \u2014 red digits on cards \n    1, \n    \u2026, n\n\nrespectively. The following line contains a string of \n    n\n digits \n    b_1,\n    \n    \u2026, b_n\n \u2014 blue digits on cards \n    1, \n    \u2026, n\n respectively.\nNote that digits in the same line are not separated with any delimiters.\nOutput Print \n    T\n answers for the test cases in order, one per line. If Red\nhas a strictly higher change to win, print \"RED\". If Blue has a strictly\nhigher change to win, print \"BLUE\". If both players are equally likely to win,\nprint \"EQUAL\". Note that all answers are case-sensitive. Example Input 3 3 777\n111 3 314 159 5 09281 09281 Output RED BLUE EQUAL Note Formally, let \n    n_R\n\nbe the number of permutations of cards \n    1, \n    \u2026, n\n such that the\nresulting numbers \n    R\n and \n    B\n satisfy \n    R > B\n. Similarly, let\n\n    n_B\n be the number of permutations such that \n    R < B\n. If \n    n_R >\n    n_B\n, you should print \"RED\". If \n    n_R < n_B\n, you should print \"BLUE\".\nIf \n    n_R = n_B\n, print \"EQUAL\". In the first sample case, \n    R = 777\n and\n\n    B = 111\n regardless of the card order, thus Red always wins. In the\nsecond sample case, there are two card orders when Red wins, and four card\norders when Blue wins: order \n    1, 2, 3\n: \n    314 > 159\n; order \n    1, 3,\n    2\n: \n    341 > 195\n; order \n    2, 1, 3\n: \n    134 < 519\n; order \n    2, 3,\n    1\n: \n    143 < 591\n; order \n    3, 1, 2\n: \n    431 < 915\n; order \n    3, 2,\n    1\n: \n    413 < 951\n.Since \n    R < B\n is more frequent, the answer is\n\"BLUE\". In the third sample case, \n    R = B\n regardless of the card order,\nthus the bet is always a draw, and both Red and Blue have zero chance to win.\n\n",
