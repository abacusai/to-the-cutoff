        "description": "Mrs. Smith is trying to contact her husband, John Smith, but she forgot the\nsecret phone number! The only thing Mrs. Smith remembered was that any\npermutation of \n    n\n can be a secret phone number. Only those permutations\nthat minimize secret value might be the phone of her husband. The sequence of\n\n    n\n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n exactly once. The secret value of a phone number is defined\nas the sum of the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and\nlength of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS). A subsequence \n    a_i_1,\n    a_i_2, \n    \u2026, a_i_k\n where \n    1\n    \u2264 i_1 < i_2 < \n    \u2026 <\n    i_k\n    \u2264 n\n is called increasing if \n    a_i_1 < a_i_2 < a_i_3 <\n    \n    \u2026 < a_i_k\n. If \n    a_i_1 > a_i_2 > a_i_3 > \n    \u2026 >\n    a_i_k\n, a subsequence is called decreasing. An increasing/decreasing\nsubsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all\nincreasing/decreasing subsequences. For example, if there is a permutation\n\n    [6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 3, 5]\n, LIS of this permutation will be \n    [1, 2, 3,\n    5]\n, so the length of LIS is equal to \n    4\n. LDS can be \n    [6, 4, 1]\n,\n\n    [6, 4, 2]\n, or \n    [6, 4, 3]\n, so the length of LDS is \n    3\n. Note,\nthe lengths of LIS and LDS can be different. So please help Mrs. Smith to find\na permutation that gives a minimum sum of lengths of LIS and LDS. Input The\nonly line contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of permutation that you need to build. Output Print a permutation that\ngives a minimum sum of lengths of LIS and LDS. If there are multiple answers,\nprint any. Examples Input 4 Output 3 4 1 2 Input 2 Output 2 1 Note In the\nfirst sample, you can build a permutation \n    [3, 4, 1, 2]\n. LIS is \n    [3,\n    4]\n (or \n    [1, 2]\n), so the length of LIS is equal to \n    2\n. LDS can be\nony of \n    [3, 1]\n, \n    [4, 2]\n, \n    [3, 2]\n, or \n    [4, 1]\n. The length\nof LDS is also equal to \n    2\n. The sum is equal to \n    4\n. Note that \n    [3,\n    4, 1, 2]\n is not the only permutation that is valid. In the second sample,\nyou can build a permutation \n    [2, 1]\n. LIS is \n    [1]\n (or \n    [2]\n), so\nthe length of LIS is equal to \n    1\n. LDS is \n    [2, 1]\n, so the length of\nLDS is equal to \n    2\n. The sum is equal to \n    3\n. Note that permutation\n\n    [1, 2]\n is also valid.\n\n",
