        "description": "You are given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an. Determine a real\nnumber x such that the weakness of the sequence a1 - x, a2 - x, ..., an - x is\nas small as possible. The weakness of a sequence is defined as the maximum\nvalue of the poorness over all segments (contiguous subsequences) of a\nsequence. The poorness of a segment is defined as the absolute value of sum of\nthe elements of segment. Input The first line contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n200 000), the length of a sequence. The second line contains n integers a1,\na2, ..., an (|ai| \u2264 10 000). Output Output a real number denoting the minimum\npossible weakness of a1 - x, a2 - x, ..., an - x. Your answer will be\nconsidered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10^-6.\nExamples Input 3 1 2 3 Output 1.000000000000000 Input 4 1 2 3 4 Output\n2.000000000000000 Input 10 1 10 2 9 3 8 4 7 5 6 Output 4.500000000000000 Note\nFor the first case, the optimal value of x is 2 so the sequence becomes - 1,\n0, 1 and the max poorness occurs at the segment \"-1\" or segment \"1\". The\npoorness value (answer) equals to 1 in this case. For the second sample the\noptimal value of x is 2.5 so the sequence becomes - 1.5, - 0.5, 0.5, 1.5 and\nthe max poorness occurs on segment \"-1.5 -0.5\" or \"0.5 1.5\". The poorness\nvalue (answer) equals to 2 in this case.\n\n",
