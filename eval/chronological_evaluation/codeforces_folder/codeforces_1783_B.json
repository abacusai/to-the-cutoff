        "description": "For a square matrix of integers of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 n\n, let's define its\nbeauty as follows: for each pair of side-adjacent elements \n    x\n and\n\n    y\n, write out the number \n    |x-y|\n, and then find the number of\ndifferent numbers among them. For example, for the matrix \n    [ 1 3; ; ; 4 2;  ]\n the numbers we consider are\n\n    |1-3|=2\n, \n    |1-4|=3\n, \n    |3-2|=1\n and \n    |4-2|=2\n; there are\n\n    3\n different numbers among them (\n    2\n, \n    3\n and \n    1\n), which\nmeans that its beauty is equal to \n    3\n. You are given an integer \n    n\n.\nYou have to find a matrix of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 n\n, where each integer from\n\n    1\n to \n    n^2\n occurs exactly once, such that its beauty is the maximum\npossible among all such matrices. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 49\n) \u2013 the number of test cases. The\nfirst (and only) line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n). Output For each test case, print \n    n\n rows of\n\n    n\n integers \u2014 a matrix of integers of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 n\n, where each\nnumber from \n    1\n to \n    n^2\n occurs exactly once, such that its beauty is\nthe maximum possible among all such matrices. If there are multiple answers,\nprint any of them. Example Input 2 2 3 Output 1 3 4 2 1 3 4 9 2 7 5 8 6\n\n",
