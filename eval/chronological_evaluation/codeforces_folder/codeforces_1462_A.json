        "description": "Polycarp has a favorite sequence \n    a[1 \n    \u2026 n]\n consisting of \n    n\n\nintegers. He wrote it out on the whiteboard as follows: he wrote the number\n\n    a_1\n to the left side (at the beginning of the whiteboard); he wrote the\nnumber \n    a_2\n to the right side (at the end of the whiteboard); then as far\nto the left as possible (but to the right from \n    a_1\n), he wrote the number\n\n    a_3\n; then as far to the right as possible (but to the left from\n\n    a_2\n), he wrote the number \n    a_4\n; Polycarp continued to act as well,\nuntil he wrote out the entire sequence on the whiteboard. The beginning of the\nresult looks like this (of course, if \n    n \n    \u2265 4\n). For example, if\n\n    n=7\n and \n    a=[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]\n, then Polycarp will write a\nsequence on the whiteboard \n    [3, 4, 5, 2, 9, 1, 1]\n. You saw the sequence\nwritten on the whiteboard and now you want to restore Polycarp's favorite\nsequence. Input The first line contains a single positive integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 300\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test. Then\n\n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 300\n) \u2014 the length of the sequence\nwritten on the whiteboard. The next line contains \n    n\n integers \n    b_1,\n    b_2,\n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the sequence written on\nthe whiteboard. Output Output \n    t\n answers to the test cases. Each answer \u2014\nis a sequence \n    a\n that Polycarp wrote out on the whiteboard. Example Input\n6 7 3 4 5 2 9 1 1 4 9 2 7 1 11 8 4 3 1 2 7 8 7 9 4 2 1 42 2 11 7 8 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 Output 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 9 1 2 7 8 2 4 4 3 9 1 7 2 8 7 42 11 7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nNote In the first test case, the sequence \n    a\n matches the sequence from\nthe statement. The whiteboard states after each step look like this: \n    [3]\n    \n    \u21d2 [3, 1] \n    \u21d2 [3, 4, 1] \n    \u21d2 [3, 4, 1, 1]\n    \n    \u21d2 [3, 4, 5, 1, 1] \n    \u21d2 [3, 4, 5, 9, 1, 1] \n    \u21d2\n    [3, 4, 5, 2, 9, 1, 1]\n.\n\n",
