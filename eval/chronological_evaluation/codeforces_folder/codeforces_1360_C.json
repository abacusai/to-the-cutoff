        "name": "Similar Pairs",
        "description": "We call two numbers \n    x\n and \n    y\n similar if they have the same parity\n(the same remainder when divided by \n    2\n), or if \n    |x-y|=1\n. For\nexample, in each of the pairs \n    (2, 6)\n, \n    (4, 3)\n, \n    (11, 7)\n, the\nnumbers are similar to each other, and in the pairs \n    (1, 4)\n, \n    (3,\n    12)\n, they are not. You are given an array \n    a\n of \n    n\n (\n    n\n is\neven) positive integers. Check if there is such a partition of the array into\npairs that each element of the array belongs to exactly one pair and the\nnumbers in each pair are similar to each other. For example, for the array\n\n    a = [11, 14, 16, 12]\n, there is a partition into pairs \n    (11, 12)\n and\n\n    (14, 16)\n. The numbers in the first pair are similar because they differ\nby one, and in the second pair because they are both even. Input The first\nline contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. Each test case consists\nof two lines. The first line contains an even positive integer \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 length of array \n    a\n. The second line contains\n\n    n\n positive integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    100\n). Output For each test case print: YES if the such a partition exists,\nNO otherwise. The letters in the words YES and NO can be displayed in any\ncase. Example Input 7 4 11 14 16 12 2 1 8 4 1 1 1 1 4 1 2 5 6 2 12 13 6 1 6 3\n10 5 8 6 1 12 3 10 5 8 Output YES NO YES YES YES YES NO Note The first test\ncase was explained in the statement. In the second test case, the two given\nnumbers are not similar. In the third test case, any partition is suitable.\n\n",
