        "description": "A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away two giant IT-corporations Pineapple\nand Gogol continue their fierce competition. Crucial moment is just around the\ncorner: Gogol is ready to release it's new tablet Lastus 3000. This new device\nis equipped with specially designed artificial intelligence (AI). Employees of\nPineapple did their best to postpone the release of Lastus 3000 as long as\npossible. Finally, they found out, that the name of the new artificial\nintelligence is similar to the name of the phone, that Pineapple released 200\nyears ago. As all rights on its name belong to Pineapple, they stand on\nchanging the name of Gogol's artificial intelligence. Pineapple insists, that\nthe name of their phone occurs in the name of AI as a substring. Because the\nname of technology was already printed on all devices, the Gogol's director\ndecided to replace some characters in AI name with \"#\". As this operation is\npretty expensive, you should find the minimum number of characters to replace\nwith \"#\", such that the name of AI doesn't contain the name of the phone as a\nsubstring. Substring is a continuous subsequence of a string. Input The first\nline of the input contains the name of AI designed by Gogol, its length\ndoesn't exceed 100 000 characters. Second line contains the name of the phone\nreleased by Pineapple 200 years ago, its length doesn't exceed 30. Both string\nare non-empty and consist of only small English letters. Output Print the\nminimum number of characters that must be replaced with \"#\" in order to obtain\nthat the name of the phone doesn't occur in the name of AI as a substring.\nExamples Input intellect tell Output 1 Input google apple Output 0 Input\nsirisiri sir Output 2 Note In the first sample AI's name may be replaced with\n\"int#llect\". In the second sample Gogol can just keep things as they are. In\nthe third sample one of the new possible names of AI may be \"s#ris#ri\".\n\n",
