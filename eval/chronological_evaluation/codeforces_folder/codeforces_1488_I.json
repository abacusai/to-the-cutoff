        "description": "Dalaran is a flying city of magic. It consists of \n    n\n floating islands\nconnected by \n    m\n bridges (each bridge can be traversed in both\ndirections). Every island is reachable from every other along these bridges.\nIt would be a shame if some magic experiment went horribly wrong and this\nmagnificent city got destroyed, right? Well, just guess what happened. A\nportal to demons' realm was opened at the island \n    1\n. This is the start of\nday \n    1\n of the catastrophe, and all \n    k\n mages have gathered at the\nisland \n    1\n (they were trying to close the portal, but found out that it\nwas impossible). At the start of day \n    2\n, a gigantic horde of demons will\nemerge from the portal, capture the island \n    1\n and kill every mage staying\nat that island. During each day \n    i\n, if the island \n    v\n was captured by\ndemons by the start of the day, the horde of demons will travel across all\nbridges connected directly to \n    v\n, capture every island they reach, and\nkill every mage they meet along the way. Each bridge contains exactly one\nmagic stone. Each mage at the start of the day can do one of the following\nactions: Spend one day travelling along one of the bridges connected to the\nisland where the mage currently is. When passing through a bridge, the mage\ncan pick up the magic stone from it (if there is any; each magic stone can be\npicked up by at most one mage). If the bridge is passed by the demons during\nthe same day, or by the start of the next day, the island where the mage goes\nis already captured by the demonic horde (even if they arrive there at the\nsame moment), the mage is killed. Perform a teleportation ritual to get to\nsafety outside Dalaran. This ritual consumes two magic stones (and cannot be\nperformed if the mage has less than two stones). Each magic stone decays in\n\n    2\n days, so if is picked up in the middle of day \n    i\n, it decays in\nthe middle of day \n    i + 2\n. Decayed stones cannot be used in teleportation\nritual. Calculate the maximum number of mages that can get to safety. Input\nThe first line contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n and \n    k\n (\n    2\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n; \n    n - 1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^5\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the number of islands, the number of bridges and the number of\nmages. Then \n    m\n lines follow, the \n    i\n-th line contains two integers\n\n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i, y_i \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    x_i \n     y_i\n)\ndenoting a bridge between the islands \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n. Each pair of\nislands has at most one bridge connecting them. Every island is reachable from\nevery other island along the bridges. Output Print one integer \u2014 the maximum\nnumber of mages that can get to safety.
