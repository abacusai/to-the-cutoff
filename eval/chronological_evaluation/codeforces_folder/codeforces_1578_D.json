        "description": "A dragon curve is a self-similar fractal curve. In this problem, it is a curve\nthat consists of straight-line segments of the same length connected at right\nangles. A simple way to construct a dragon curve is as follows: take a strip\nof paper, fold it in half \n    n\n times in the same direction, then partially\nunfold it such that the segments are joined at right angles. This is\nillustrated here: In this example, a dragon curve of order \n    3\n is\nconstructed. In general, a dragon curve of a higher order will have a dragon\ncurve of a lower order as its prefix. This allows us to define a dragon curve\nof infinite order, which is the limit of dragon curves of a finite order as\nthe order approaches infinity. Consider four dragon curves of infinite order.\nEach starts at the origin (the point \n    (0,0)\n), and the length of each\nsegment is \n    \u221a(2)\n. The first segments of the curves end at the points\n\n    (1,1)\n, \n    (-1,1)\n, \n    (-1,-1)\n and \n    (1,-1)\n, respectively. The\nfirst turn of each curve is left (that is, the second segment of the first\ncurve ends at the point \n    (0,2)\n). In this case, every segment is a\ndiagonal of an axis-aligned unit square with integer coordinates, and it can\nbe proven that there is exactly one segment passing through every such square.\nGiven a point \n    (x,y)\n, your task is to find on which of the four curves\nlies the segment passing through the square with the opposite corners at\n\n    (x,y)\n and \n    (x+1,y+1)\n, as well as the position of that segment on\nthat curve. The curves are numbered \n    1\n through \n    4\n. Curve \n    1\n\ngoes through \n    (1,1)\n, \n    2\n through \n    (-1,1)\n, \n    3\n through\n\n    (-1,-1)\n, and \n    4\n through \n    (1,-1)\n. The segments are numbered\nstarting with \n    1\n. Input The first line contains an integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u22642\n    \u00b710^5\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each of the\nfollowing \n    n\n lines contains two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n\n(\n    -10^9\n    \u2264 x,y\n    \u226410^9\n) \u2014 the coordinates. Output For each test case,\nprint a line containing two integers \u2014 the first is the index of the curve (an\ninteger between \n    1\n and \n    4\n, inclusive), and the second is the\nposition on the curve (the first segment has the position \n    1\n). Example\nInput 5 0 0 -2 0 -7 -7 5 -9 9 9 Output 1 1 2 2 3 189 4 186 2 68 Note You can\nuse this illustration to debug your solution:\n\n",
