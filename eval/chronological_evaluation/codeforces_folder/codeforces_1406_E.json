        "description": "This is an interactive problem. There is an unknown integer \n    x\n (\n    1\n    \u2264\n    x\n    \u2264 n\n). You want to find \n    x\n. At first, you have a set of integers\n\n    1, 2, \n    \u2026, n\n. You can perform the following operations no\nmore than \n    10000\n times: A \n    a\n: find how many numbers are multiples of\n\n    a\n in the current set. B \n    a\n: find how many numbers are multiples of\n\n    a\n in this set, and then delete all multiples of \n    a\n, but \n    x\n\nwill never be deleted (even if it is a multiple of \n    a\n). In this\noperation, \n    a\n must be greater than \n    1\n. C \n    a\n: it means that you\nknow that \n    x=a\n. This operation can be only performed once. Remember that\nin the operation of type B \n    a>1\n must hold. Write a program, that will\nfind the value of \n    x\n. Input The first line contains one integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 10^5\n). The remaining parts of the input will be given\nthroughout the interaction process. Interaction In each round, your program\nneeds to print a line containing one uppercase letter A, B or C and an integer\n\n    a\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 a\n    \u2264 n\n for operations A and C, \n    2\n    \u2264 a\n    \u2264 n\n\nfor operation B). This line desribes operation you make. If your operation has\ntype C your program should terminate immediately. Else your program should\nread one line containing a single integer, which is the answer to your\noperation. After outputting each line, don't forget to flush the output. To do\nit use: fflush(stdout) in C/C++; System.out.flush() in Java;\nsys.stdout.flush() in Python; flush(output) in Pascal; See the documentation\nfor other languages. It is guaranteed, that the number \n    x\n is fixed and\nwon't change during the interaction process. Hacks: To make a hack, use such\ninput format: The only line should contain two integers \n    n\n, \n    x\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n). Example Input 10 2 4 0 Output B 4 A 2 A 8 C\n4 Note Note that to make the sample more clear, we added extra empty lines.\nYou shouldn't print any extra empty lines during the interaction process. In\nthe first test \n    n=10\n and \n    x=4\n. Initially the set is:\n\n    1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n. In the first operation, you ask how many\nnumbers are multiples of \n    4\n and delete them. The answer is \n    2\n\nbecause there are two numbers divisible by \n    4\n: \n    4,8\n.\n\n    8\n will be deleted but \n    4\n won't, because the number \n    x\n will\nnever be deleted. Now the set is \n    1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10\n. In the\nsecond operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of \n    2\n. The\nanswer is \n    4\n because there are four numbers divisible by \n    2\n:\n\n    2,4,6,10\n. In the third operation, you ask how many numbers are\nmultiples of \n    8\n. The answer is \n    0\n because there isn't any number\ndivisible by \n    8\n in the current set. In the fourth operation, you know\nthat \n    x=4\n, which is the right answer.\n\n",
