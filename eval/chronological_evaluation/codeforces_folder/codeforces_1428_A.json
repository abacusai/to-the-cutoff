        "description": "Wabbit is trying to move a box containing food for the rest of the zoo in the\ncoordinate plane from the point \n    (x_1,y_1)\n to the point \n    (x_2,y_2)\n.\nHe has a rope, which he can use to pull the box. He can only pull the box if\nhe stands exactly \n    1\n unit away from the box in the direction of one of\ntwo coordinate axes. He will pull the box to where he is standing before\nmoving out of the way in the same direction by \n    1\n unit. For example, if\nthe box is at the point \n    (1,2)\n and Wabbit is standing at the point\n\n    (2,2)\n, he can pull the box right by \n    1\n unit, with the box ending up\nat the point \n    (2,2)\n and Wabbit ending at the point \n    (3,2)\n. Also,\nWabbit can move \n    1\n unit to the right, left, up, or down without pulling\nthe box. In this case, it is not necessary for him to be in exactly \n    1\n\nunit away from the box. If he wants to pull the box again, he must return to a\npoint next to the box. Also, Wabbit can't move to the point where the box is\nlocated. Wabbit can start at any point. It takes \n    1\n second to travel\n\n    1\n unit right, left, up, or down, regardless of whether he pulls the box\nwhile moving. Determine the minimum amount of time he needs to move the box\nfrom \n    (x_1,y_1)\n to \n    (x_2,y_2)\n. Note that the point where Wabbit ends\nup at does not matter. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first\nline contains a single integer \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000)\n: the\nnumber of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. Each of the\nnext \n    t\n lines contains four space-separated integers \n    x_1, y_1, x_2,\n    y_2\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \n    \u2264 10^9)\n, describing the next\ntest case. Output For each test case, print a single integer: the minimum time\nin seconds Wabbit needs to bring the box from \n    (x_1,y_1)\n to\n\n    (x_2,y_2)\n. Example Input 2 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 Output 1 4 Note In the first\ntest case, the starting and the ending points of the box are \n    (1,2)\n and\n\n    (2,2)\n respectively. This is the same as the picture in the statement.\nWabbit needs only \n    1\n second to move as shown in the picture in the\nstatement. In the second test case, Wabbit can start at the point \n    (2,1)\n.\nHe pulls the box to \n    (2,1)\n while moving to \n    (3,1)\n. He then moves to\n\n    (3,2)\n and then to \n    (2,2)\n without pulling the box. Then, he pulls\nthe box to \n    (2,2)\n while moving to \n    (2,3)\n. It takes \n    4\n seconds.\n\n",
