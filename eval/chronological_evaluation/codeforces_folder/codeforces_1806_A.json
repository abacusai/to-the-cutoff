        "description": "YunQian is standing on an infinite plane with the Cartesian coordinate system\non it. In one move, she can move to the diagonally adjacent point on the top\nright or the adjacent point on the left. That is, if she is standing on point\n\n    (x,y)\n, she can either move to point \n    (x+1,y+1)\n or point\n\n    (x-1,y)\n. YunQian initially stands at point \n    (a,b)\n and wants to move\nto point \n    (c,d)\n. Find the minimum number of moves she needs to make or\ndeclare that it is impossible. Input The first line contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description\nof test cases follows. The first line and only line of each test case contain\nfour integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    c\n, \n    d\n (\n    -10^8\n    \u2264 a,b,c,d\n    \u2264\n    10^8\n). Output For each test case, if it is possible to move from point\n\n    (a,b)\n to point \n    (c,d)\n, output the minimum number of moves.\nOtherwise, output \n    -1\n. Example Input 6 -1 0 -1 2 0 0 4 5 -2 -1 1 1 -3 2\n-3 2 2 -1 -1 -1 1 1 0 2 Output 4 6 -1 0 3 3 Note In the first test case, one\npossible way using \n    4\n moves is \n    (-1,0)\n    \u2192 (0,1)\n    \u2192 (-1,1)\n    \u2192\n    (0,2)\n    \u2192 (-1,2)\n. It can be proven that it is impossible to move from\npoint \n    (-1,0)\n to point \n    (-1,2)\n in less than \n    4\n moves.\n\n",
