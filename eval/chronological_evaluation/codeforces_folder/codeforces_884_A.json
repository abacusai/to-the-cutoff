        "description": "Recently Luba bought a very interesting book. She knows that it will take t\nseconds to read the book. Luba wants to finish reading as fast as she can. But\nshe has some work to do in each of n next days. The number of seconds that\nLuba has to spend working during i-th day is ai. If some free time remains,\nshe can spend it on reading. Help Luba to determine the minimum number of day\nwhen she finishes reading. It is guaranteed that the answer doesn't exceed n.\nRemember that there are 86400 seconds in a day. Input The first line contains\ntwo integers n and t (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of days and the\ntime required to read the book. The second line contains n integers ai (0 \u2264 ai\n\u2264 86400) \u2014 the time Luba has to spend on her work during i-th day. Output\nPrint the minimum day Luba can finish reading the book. It is guaranteed that\nanswer doesn't exceed n. Examples Input 2 2 86400 86398 Output 2 Input 2 86400\n0 86400 Output 1\n\n",
