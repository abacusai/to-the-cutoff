        "name": "Ralph And His Tour in Binary Country",
        "description": "Ralph is in the Binary Country. The Binary Country consists of n cities and (n\n- 1) bidirectional roads connecting the cities. The roads are numbered from 1\nto (n - 1), the i-th road connects the city labeled (here \u230a x\u230b denotes the x\nrounded down to the nearest integer) and the city labeled (i + 1), and the\nlength of the i-th road is Li. Now Ralph gives you m queries. In each query he\ntells you some city Ai and an integer Hi. He wants to make some tours starting\nfrom this city. He can choose any city in the Binary Country (including Ai) as\nthe terminal city for a tour. He gains happiness (Hi - L) during a tour, where\nL is the distance between the city Ai and the terminal city. Ralph is\ninterested in tours from Ai in which he can gain positive happiness. For each\nquery, compute the sum of happiness gains for all such tours. Ralph will never\ntake the same tour twice or more (in one query), he will never pass the same\ncity twice or more in one tour. Input The first line contains two integers n\nand m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5). (n - 1) lines follow, each line contains\none integer Li (1 \u2264 Li \u2264 10^5), which denotes the length of the i-th road. m\nlines follow, each line contains two integers Ai and Hi (1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 Hi \u2264\n10^7). Output Print m lines, on the i-th line print one integer \u2014 the answer\nfor the i-th query. Examples Input 2 2 5 1 8 2 4 Output 11 4 Input 6 4 2 1 1 3\n2 2 4 1 3 3 2 1 7 Output 11 6 3 28 Note Here is the explanation for the second\nsample. Ralph's first query is to start tours from city 2 and Hi equals to 4.\nHere are the options: He can choose city 5 as his terminal city. Since the\ndistance between city 5 and city 2 is 3, he can gain happiness 4 - 3 = 1. He\ncan choose city 4 as his terminal city and gain happiness 3. He can choose\ncity 1 as his terminal city and gain happiness 2. He can choose city 3 as his\nterminal city and gain happiness 1. Note that Ralph can choose city 2 as his\nterminal city and gain happiness 4. Ralph won't choose city 6 as his terminal\ncity because the distance between city 6 and city 2 is 5, which leads to\nnegative happiness for Ralph. So the answer for the first query is 1 + 3 + 2 +\n1 + 4 = 11.\n\n",
