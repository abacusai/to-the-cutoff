        "description": "Little Masha loves arranging her toys into piles on the floor. And she also\nhates it when somebody touches her toys. One day Masha arranged all her n toys\ninto several piles and then her elder brother Sasha came and gathered all the\npiles into one. Having seen it, Masha got very upset and started crying. Sasha\nstill can't calm Masha down and mom is going to come home soon and punish\nSasha for having made Masha crying. That's why he decides to restore the\npiles' arrangement. However, he doesn't remember at all the way the toys used\nto lie. Of course, Masha remembers it, but she can't talk yet and can only\nhelp Sasha by shouting happily when he arranges the toys in the way they used\nto lie. That means that Sasha will have to arrange the toys in every possible\nway until Masha recognizes the needed arrangement. The relative position of\nthe piles and toys in every pile is irrelevant, that's why the two ways of\narranging the toys are considered different if can be found two such toys that\nwhen arranged in the first way lie in one and the same pile and do not if\narranged in the second way. Sasha is looking for the fastest way of trying all\nthe ways because mom will come soon. With every action Sasha can take a toy\nfrom any pile and move it to any other pile (as a result a new pile may appear\nor the old one may disappear). Sasha wants to find the sequence of actions as\na result of which all the pile arrangement variants will be tried exactly one\ntime each. Help Sasha. As we remember, initially all the toys are located in\none pile. Input The first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10) \u2014 the number\nof toys. Output In the first line print the number of different variants of\narrangement of toys into piles. Then print all the ways of arranging toys into\npiles in the order in which Sasha should try them (i.e. every next way must\nresult from the previous one through the operation described in the\nstatement). Every way should be printed in the following format. In every pile\nthe toys should be arranged in ascending order of the numbers. Then the piles\nshould be sorted in ascending order of the numbers of the first toys there.\nOutput every way on a single line. Cf. the example to specify the output data\nformat. If the solution is not unique, output any of them. Examples Input 3\nOutput 5 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,3,2\n\n",
