        "description": "In a far away kingdom lived the King, the Prince, the Shoemaker, the\nDressmaker and many other citizens. They lived happily until great trouble\ncame into the Kingdom. The ACMers settled there. Most damage those strange\ncreatures inflicted upon the kingdom was that they loved high precision\nnumbers. As a result, the Kingdom healers had already had three appointments\nwith the merchants who were asked to sell, say, exactly 0.273549107 beer\nbarrels. To deal with the problem somehow, the King issued an order obliging\nrounding up all numbers to the closest integer to simplify calculations.\nSpecifically, the order went like this: If a number's integer part does not\nend with digit 9 and its fractional part is strictly less than 0.5, then the\nrounded up number coincides with the number\u2019s integer part. If a number's\ninteger part does not end with digit 9 and its fractional part is not less\nthan 0.5, the rounded up number is obtained if we add 1 to the last digit of\nthe number\u2019s integer part. If the number\u2019s integer part ends with digit 9, to\nround up the numbers one should go to Vasilisa the Wise. In the whole Kingdom\nshe is the only one who can perform the tricky operation of carrying into the\nnext position. Merchants found the algorithm very sophisticated and they asked\nyou (the ACMers) to help them. Can you write a program that would perform the\nrounding according to the King\u2019s order? Input The first line contains a single\nnumber to round up \u2014 the integer part (a non-empty set of decimal digits that\ndo not start with 0 \u2014 with the exception of a case when the set consists of a\nsingle digit \u2014 in this case 0 can go first), then follows character \u00ab.\u00bb (a\ndot), and then follows the fractional part (any non-empty set of decimal\ndigits). The number's length does not exceed 1000 characters, including the\ndot. There are no other characters in the input data. Output If the last\nnumber of the integer part is not equal to 9, print the rounded-up number\nwithout leading zeroes. Otherwise, print the message \"GOTO Vasilisa.\" (without\nthe quotes). Examples Input 0.0 Output 0 Input 1.49 Output 1 Input 1.50 Output\n2 Input 2.71828182845904523536 Output 3 Input 3.14159265358979323846 Output 3\nInput 12345678901234567890.1 Output 12345678901234567890 Input\n123456789123456789.999 Output GOTO Vasilisa.\n\n",
