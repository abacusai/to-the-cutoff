        "description": "During a daily walk Alina noticed a long number written on the ground. Now\nAlina wants to find some positive number of same length without leading\nzeroes, such that the sum of these two numbers is a palindrome. Recall that a\nnumber is called a palindrome, if it reads the same right to left and left to\nright. For example, numbers \n    121, 66, 98989\n are palindromes, and \n    103,\n    239, 1241\n are not palindromes. Alina understands that a valid number always\nexist. Help her find one! Input The first line of input data contains an\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nNext, descriptions of \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of each test\ncase contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) \u2014\nthe length of the number that is written on the ground. The second line of\ncontains the positive \n    n\n-digit integer without leading zeroes \u2014 the\nnumber itself. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values \n    n\n over all\ntest cases does not exceed \n    100\n     000\n. Output For each of \n    t\n test\ncases print an answer \u2014 a positive \n    n\n-digit integer without leading\nzeros, such that the sum of the input integer and this number is a palindrome.\nWe can show that at least one number satisfying the constraints exists. If\nthere are multiple solutions, you can output any of them. Example Input 3 2 99\n4 1023 3 385 Output 32 8646 604 Note In the first test case \n    99 + 32 =\n    131\n is a palindrome. Note that another answer is \n    12\n, because \n    99 +\n    12 = 111\n is also a palindrome. In the second test case \n    1023 + 8646 =\n    9669\n. In the third test case \n    385 + 604 = 989\n.\n\n",
