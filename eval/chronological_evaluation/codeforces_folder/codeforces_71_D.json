        "description": "Vasya has a pack of 54 cards (52 standard cards and 2 distinct jokers). That\nis all he has at the moment. Not to die from boredom, Vasya plays Solitaire\nwith them. Vasya lays out nm cards as a rectangle n \u00d7 m. If there are jokers\namong them, then Vasya should change them with some of the rest of 54 - nm\ncards (which are not layed out) so that there were no jokers left. Vasya can\npick the cards to replace the jokers arbitrarily. Remember, that each card\npresents in pack exactly once (i. e. in a single copy). Vasya tries to perform\nthe replacements so that the solitaire was solved. Vasya thinks that the\nsolitaire is solved if after the jokers are replaced, there exist two non-\noverlapping squares 3 \u00d7 3, inside each of which all the cards either have the\nsame suit, or pairwise different ranks. Determine by the initial position\nwhether the solitaire can be solved or not. If it can be solved, show the way\nin which it is possible. Input The first line contains integers n and m (3 \u2264\nn, m \u2264 17, n \u00d7 m \u2264 52). Next n lines contain m words each. Each word consists\nof two letters. The jokers are defined as \"J1\" and \"J2\" correspondingly. For\nthe rest of the cards, the first letter stands for the rank and the second one\n\u2014 for the suit. The possible ranks are: \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\",\n\"9\", \"T\", \"J\", \"Q\", \"K\" and \"A\". The possible suits are: \"C\", \"D\", \"H\" and\n\"S\". All the cards are different. Output If the Solitaire can be solved, print\non the first line \"Solution exists.\" without the quotes. On the second line\nprint in what way the jokers can be replaced. Three variants are possible:\n\"There are no jokers.\", if there are no jokers in the input data. \"Replace Jx\nwith y.\", if there is one joker. x is its number, and y is the card it should\nbe replaced with. \"Replace J1 with x and J2 with y.\", if both jokers are\npresent in the input data. x and y here represent distinct cards with which\none should replace the first and the second jokers correspondingly.On the\nthird line print the coordinates of the upper left corner of the first square\n3 \u00d7 3 in the format \"Put the first square to (r, c).\", where r and c are the\nrow and the column correspondingly. In the same manner print on the fourth\nline the coordinates of the second square 3 \u00d7 3 in the format \"Put the second\nsquare to (r, c).\". If there are several solutions to that problem, print any\nof them. If there are no solutions, print of the single line \"No solution.\"\nwithout the quotes. See the samples to understand the output format better.\nExamples Input 4 6 2S 3S 4S 7S 8S AS 5H 6H 7H 5S TC AC 8H 9H TH 7C 8C 9C 2D 2C\n3C 4C 5C 6C Output No solution.
