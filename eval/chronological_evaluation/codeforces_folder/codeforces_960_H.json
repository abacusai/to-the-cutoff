        "description": "Santa has an infinite number of candies for each of \n    m\n flavours. You are\ngiven a rooted tree with \n    n\n vertices. The root of the tree is the vertex\n\n    1\n. Each vertex contains exactly one candy. The \n    i\n-th vertex has a\ncandy of flavour \n    f_i\n. Sometimes Santa fears that candies of flavour\n\n    k\n have melted. He chooses any vertex \n    x\n randomly and sends the\nsubtree of \n    x\n to the Bakers for a replacement. In a replacement, all the\ncandies with flavour \n    k\n are replaced with a new candy of the same\nflavour. The candies which are not of flavour \n    k\n are left unchanged.\nAfter the replacement, the tree is restored. The actual cost of replacing one\ncandy of flavour \n    k\n is \n    c_k\n (given for each \n    k\n). The Baker\nkeeps the price fixed in order to make calculation simple. Every time when a\nsubtree comes for a replacement, the Baker charges \n    C\n, no matter which\nsubtree it is and which flavour it is. Suppose that for a given flavour\n\n    k\n the probability that Santa chooses a vertex for replacement is same\nfor all the vertices. You need to find out the expected value of error in\ncalculating the cost of replacement of flavour \n    k\n. The error in\ncalculating the cost is defined as follows. \n    \n\n    Error\n     E(k) =\n     (Actual\n    Cost\n     \u2013\n     Price\n     charged\n     by\n     the\n     Bakers) ^ 2.\n\n    \n Note that the\nactual cost is the cost of replacement of one candy of the flavour \n    k\n\nmultiplied by the number of candies in the subtree. Also, sometimes Santa may\nwish to replace a candy at vertex \n    x\n with a candy of some flavour from\nhis pocket. You need to handle two types of operations: Change the flavour of\nthe candy at vertex \n    x\n to \n    w\n. Calculate the expected value of error\nin calculating the cost of replacement for a given flavour \n    k\n. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains four integers \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2a7d n\n    \n    \u2a7d 5 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n), \n    m\n, \n    q\n, \n    C\n (\n    1 \n    \u2a7d m,\n    q \n    \u2a7d 5 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n, \n    0 \n    \u2a7d C \n    \u2a7d 10^6\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of nodes, total number of different flavours of candies, the number of\nqueries and the price charged by the Bakers for replacement, respectively. The\nsecond line contains \n    n\n integers \n    f_1, f_2, \n    \u2026, f_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2a7d f_i \n    \u2a7d m\n), where \n    f_i\n is the initial flavour of\nthe candy in the \n    i\n-th node. The third line contains \n    n - 1\n integers\n\n    p_2, p_3, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2a7d p_i \n    \u2a7d n\n), where\n\n    p_i\n is the parent of the \n    i\n-th node. The next line contains \n    m\n\nintegers \n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026 c_m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2a7d c_i \n    \u2a7d\n    10^2\n), where \n    c_i\n is the cost of replacing one candy of flavour\n\n    i\n. The next \n    q\n lines describe the queries. Each line starts with an\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2a7d t \n    \u2a7d 2\n) \u2014 the type of the query.\nIf \n    t = 1\n, then the line describes a query of the first type. Two\nintegers \n    x\n and \n    w\n follow (\n    1 \n    \u2a7d x \n    \u2a7d n\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2a7d w \n    \u2a7d m\n), it means that Santa replaces the candy at\nvertex \n    x\n with flavour \n    w\n. Otherwise, if \n    t = 2\n, the line\ndescribes a query of the second type and an integer \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2a7d\n    k \n    \u2a7d m\n) follows, it means that you should print the expected value\nof the error in calculating the cost of replacement for a given flavour\n\n    k\n. The vertices are indexed from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Vertex \n    1\n is\nthe root. Output Output the answer to each query of the second type in a\nseparate line. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative\nerror does not exceed \n    10^-6\n. Formally, let your answer be \n    a\n, and\nthe jury's answer be \n    b\n. The checker program considers your answer\ncorrect if and only if \n    |a-b|/max(1,b)\n    \u2a7d 10^-6\n.\nExample Input 3 5 5 7 3 1 4 1 1 73 1 48 85 89 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 Output\n2920.333333333333 593.000000000000 49.000000000000 3217.000000000000 Note For\n\n    1\n-st query, the error in calculating the cost of replacement for flavour\n\n    1\n if vertex \n    1\n, \n    2\n or \n    3\n is chosen are \n    66^2\n,\n\n    66^2\n and \n    (-7)^2\n respectively. Since the probability of choosing\nany vertex is same, therefore the expected value of error is\n\n    66^2+66^2+(-7)^2/3\n. Similarly, for \n    2\n-nd query the\nexpected value of error is \n    41^2+(-7)^2+(-7)^2/3\n. After\n\n    3\n-rd query, the flavour at vertex \n    2\n changes from \n    1\n to\n\n    3\n. For \n    4\n-th query, the expected value of error is\n\n    (-7)^2+(-7)^2+(-7)^2/3\n. Similarly, for \n    5\n-th query, the\nexpected value of error is \n    89^2+41^2+(-7)^2/3\n.\n\n",
