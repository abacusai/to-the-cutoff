        "name": "Johnny and Another Rating Drop",
        "description": "The last contest held on Johnny's favorite competitive programming platform\nhas been received rather positively. However, Johnny's rating has dropped\nagain! He thinks that the presented tasks are lovely, but don't show the truth\nabout competitors' skills. The boy is now looking at the ratings of\nconsecutive participants written in a binary system. He thinks that the more\nsuch ratings differ, the more unfair is that such people are next to each\nother. He defines the difference between two numbers as the number of bit\npositions, where one number has zero, and another has one (we suppose that\nnumbers are padded with leading zeros to the same length). For example, the\ndifference of \n    5 = 101_2\n and \n    14 = 1110_2\n equals to \n    3\n, since\n\n    0101\n and \n    1110\n differ in \n    3\n positions. Johnny defines the\nunfairness of the contest as the sum of such differences counted for\nneighboring participants. Johnny has just sent you the rating sequence and\nwants you to find the unfairness of the competition. You have noticed that\nyou've got a sequence of consecutive integers from \n    0\n to \n    n\n. That's\nstrange, but the boy stubbornly says that everything is right. So help him and\nfind the desired unfairness for received numbers. Input The input consists of\nmultiple test cases. The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    t \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The following \n    t\n lines\ncontain a description of test cases. The first and only line in each test case\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^18)\n. Output\nOutput \n    t\n lines. For each test case, you should output a single line with\none integer \u2014 the unfairness of the contest if the rating sequence equals to\n\n    0\n, \n    1\n, ..., \n    n - 1\n, \n    n\n. Example Input 5 5 7 11 1\n2000000000000 Output 8 11 19 1 3999999999987 Note For \n    n = 5\n we calculate\nunfairness of the following sequence (numbers from \n    0\n to \n    5\n written\nin binary with extra leading zeroes, so they all have the same length):\n\n    000\n \n    001\n \n    010\n \n    011\n \n    100\n \n    101\n The differences\nare equal to \n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    1\n, \n    3\n, \n    1\n respectively, so\nunfairness is equal to \n    1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 8\n.\n\n",
