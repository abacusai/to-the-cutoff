        "description": "Joseph really likes the culture of Japan. Last year he learned Japanese\ntraditional clothes and visual arts and now he is trying to find out the\nsecret of the Japanese game called Nonogram. In the one-dimensional version of\nthe game, there is a row of \n    n\n empty cells, some of which are to be\nfilled with a pen. There is a description of a solution called a profile \u2014 a\nsequence of positive integers denoting the lengths of consecutive sets of\nfilled cells. For example, the profile of \n    [4, 3, 1]\n means that there are\nsets of four, three, and one filled cell, in that order, with at least one\nempty cell between successive sets. A suitable solution for \n    n = 12\n and\n\n    p = [4, 3, 1]\n. A wrong solution: the first four filled cells should be\nconsecutive. A wrong solution: there should be at least one empty cell before\nthe last filled cell. Joseph found out that for some numbers \n    n\n and\nprofiles \n    p\n there are lots of ways to fill the cells to satisfy the\nprofile. Now he is in the process of solving a nonogram consisting of \n    n\n\ncells and a profile \n    p\n. He has already created a mask of \n    p\n \u2014 he has\nfilled all the cells that must be filled in every solution of the nonogram.\nThe mask for \n    n = 12\n and \n    p = [4, 3, 1]\n: all the filled cells above\nare filled in every solution. After a break, he lost the source profile\n\n    p\n. He only has \n    n\n and the mask \n    m\n. Help Joseph find any\nprofile \n    p'\n with the mask \n    m\n or say that there is no such profile\nand Joseph has made a mistake. Input The only line contains a string \n    m\n \u2014\nthe mask of the source profile \n    p\n. The length of \n    m\n is \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n). The string \n    m\n consists of symbols # and _ \u2014\ndenoting filled and empty cells respectively. Output If there is no profile\nwith the mask \n    m\n, output the number \n    -1\n. Otherwise, on the first\nline, output an integer \n    k\n \u2014 the number of integers in the profile\n\n    p'\n. On the second line, output \n    k\n integers of the profile \n    p'\n.\nExamples Input __#_____ Output 2 3 2 Input _# Output -1 Input ___ Output 0\n\n",
