        "description": "You are given a positive integer \n    n\n. Let's call some positive integer\n\n    a\n without leading zeroes palindromic if it remains the same after\nreversing the order of its digits. Find the number of distinct ways to express\n\n    n\n as a sum of positive palindromic integers. Two ways are considered\ndifferent if the frequency of at least one palindromic integer is different in\nthem. For example, \n    5=4+1\n and \n    5=3+1+1\n are considered different but\n\n    5=3+1+1\n and \n    5=1+3+1\n are considered the same. Formally, you need to\nfind the number of distinct multisets of positive palindromic integers the sum\nof which is equal to \n    n\n. Since the answer can be quite large, print it\nmodulo \n    10^9+7\n. Input The first line of input contains a single integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 10^4\n) denoting the number of testcases. Each\ntestcase contains a single line of input containing a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264 4\n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014 the required sum of palindromic\nintegers. Output For each testcase, print a single integer denoting the\nrequired answer modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Example Input 2 5 12 Output 7 74 Note For\nthe first testcase, there are \n    7\n ways to partition \n    5\n as a sum of\npositive palindromic integers: \n    5=1+1+1+1+1\n \n    5=1+1+1+2\n \n    5=1+2+2\n\n\n    5=1+1+3\n \n    5=2+3\n \n    5=1+4\n \n    5=5\n For the second testcase, there\nare total \n    77\n ways to partition \n    12\n as a sum of positive integers\nbut among them, the partitions \n    12=2+10\n, \n    12=1+1+10\n and \n    12=12\n\nare not valid partitions of \n    12\n as a sum of positive palindromic integers\nbecause \n    10\n and \n    12\n are not palindromic. So, there are \n    74\n ways\nto partition \n    12\n as a sum of positive palindromic integers.\n\n",
