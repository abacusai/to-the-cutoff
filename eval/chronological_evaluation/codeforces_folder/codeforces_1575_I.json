        "description": "Chanek Jones is back, helping his long-lost relative Indiana Jones, to find a\nsecret treasure in a maze buried below a desert full of illusions. The map of\nthe labyrinth forms a tree with \n    n\n rooms numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n\nand \n    n - 1\n tunnels connecting them such that it is possible to travel\nbetween each pair of rooms through several tunnels. The \n    i\n-th room (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) has \n    a_i\n illusion rate. To go from the \n    x\n-th\nroom to the \n    y\n-th room, there must exist a tunnel between \n    x\n and\n\n    y\n, and it takes \n    max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|)\n energy. \n    |z|\n\ndenotes the absolute value of \n    z\n. To prevent grave robbers, the maze can\nchange the illusion rate of any room in it. Chanek and Indiana would ask\n\n    q\n queries. There are two types of queries to be done: \n    1\n     u\n     c\n\n\u2014 The illusion rate of the \n    x\n-th room is changed to \n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    u \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 |c| \n    \u2264 10^9\n). \n    2\n     u\n     v\n \u2014 Chanek and\nIndiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure\nat room \n    v\n if they are initially at room \n    u\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u, v \n    \u2264\n    n\n). Help them, so you can get a portion of the treasure! Input The first\nline contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    q\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n,\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of rooms in the maze and the number\nof queries. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 |a_i| \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 inital illusion rate of each room.\nThe \n    i\n-th of the next \n    n-1\n lines contains two integers \n    s_i\n and\n\n    t_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 s_i, t_i \n    \u2264 n\n), meaning there is a tunnel\nconnecting \n    s_i\n-th room and \n    t_i\n-th room. The given edges form a\ntree. The next \n    q\n lines contain the query as described. The given queries\nare valid. Output For each type \n    2\n query, output a line containing an\ninteger \u2014 the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the\nsecret treasure. Example Input 6 4 10 -9 2 -1 4 -6 1 5 5 4 5 6 6 2 6 3 2 1 2 1\n1 -3 2 1 2 2 3 3 Output 39 32 0 Note In the first query, their movement from\nthe \n    1\n-st to the \n    2\n-nd room is as follows. \n    1 \n    \u2192 5\n \u2014\ntakes \n    max(|10 + 4|, |10 - 4|) = 14\n energy. \n    5 \n    \u2192 6\n \u2014\ntakes \n    max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10\n energy. \n    6 \n    \u2192\n    2\n \u2014 takes \n    max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15\n energy. In total, it\ntakes \n    39\n energy.In the second query, the illusion rate of the \n    1\n-st\nroom changes from \n    10\n to \n    -3\n. In the third query, their movement\nfrom the \n    1\n-st to the \n    2\n-nd room is as follows. \n    1 \n    \u2192\n    5\n \u2014 takes \n    max(|-3 + 4|, |-3 - 4|) = 7\n energy. \n    5 \n    \u2192\n    6\n \u2014 takes \n    max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10\n energy. \n    6\n    \n    \u2192 2\n \u2014 takes \n    max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15\n energy.\nNow, it takes \n    32\n energy.\n\n",
