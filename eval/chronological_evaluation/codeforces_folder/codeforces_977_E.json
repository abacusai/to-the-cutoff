        "description": "You are given an undirected graph consisting of \n    n\n vertices and \n    m\n\nedges. Your task is to find the number of connected components which are\ncycles. Here are some definitions of graph theory. An undirected graph\nconsists of two sets: set of nodes (called vertices) and set of edges. Each\nedge connects a pair of vertices. All edges are bidirectional (i.e. if a\nvertex \n    a\n is connected with a vertex \n    b\n, a vertex \n    b\n is also\nconnected with a vertex \n    a\n). An edge can't connect vertex with itself,\nthere is at most one edge between a pair of vertices. Two vertices \n    u\n and\n\n    v\n belong to the same connected component if and only if there is at\nleast one path along edges connecting \n    u\n and \n    v\n. A connected\ncomponent is a cycle if and only if its vertices can be reordered in such a\nway that: the first vertex is connected with the second vertex by an edge, the\nsecond vertex is connected with the third vertex by an edge, ... the last\nvertex is connected with the first vertex by an edge, all the described edges\nof a cycle are distinct. A cycle doesn't contain any other edges except\ndescribed above. By definition any cycle contains three or more vertices.\nThere are \n    6\n connected components, \n    2\n of them are cycles: \n    [7, 10,\n    16]\n and \n    [5, 11, 9, 15]\n. Input The first line contains two integer\nnumbers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264\n    m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 number of vertices and edges. The following\n\n    m\n lines contains edges: edge \n    i\n is given as a pair of vertices\n\n    v_i\n, \n    u_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 v_i, u_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    u_i \n     v_i\n).\nThere is no multiple edges in the given graph, i.e. for each pair (\n    v_i,\n    u_i\n) there no other pairs (\n    v_i, u_i\n) and (\n    u_i, v_i\n) in the list\nof edges. Output Print one integer \u2014 the number of connected components which\nare also cycles. Examples Input 5 4 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 5 Output 1 Input 17 15 1 8 1\n12 5 11 11 9 9 15 15 5 4 13 3 13 4 3 10 16 7 10 16 7 14 3 14 4 17 6 Output 2\nNote In the first example only component \n    [3, 4, 5]\n is also a cycle. The\nillustration above corresponds to the second example.\n\n",
