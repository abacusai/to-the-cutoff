        "description": "Arkady's morning seemed to be straight of his nightmare. He overslept through\nthe whole morning and, still half-asleep, got into the tram that arrived the\nfirst. Some time after, leaving the tram, he realized that he was not sure\nabout the line number of the tram he was in. During his ride, Arkady woke up\nseveral times and each time he saw the tram stopping at some stop. For each\nstop he knows which lines of tram stop there. Given this information, can you\nhelp Arkady determine what are the possible lines of the tram he was in? Input\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014\nthe number of stops Arkady saw. The next \n    n\n lines describe the stops.\nEach of them starts with a single integer \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 100\n)\n\u2014 the number of tram lines that stop there. \n    r\n distinct integers follow,\neach one between \n    1\n and \n    100\n, inclusive, \u2014 the line numbers. They\ncan be in arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Arkady's information is\nconsistent, i.e. there is at least one tram line that Arkady could take.\nOutput Print all tram lines that Arkady could be in, in arbitrary order.\nExamples Input 3 3 1 4 6 2 1 4 5 10 5 6 4 1 Output 1 4 Input 5 1 1 10 10 9 8 7\n100 5 4 3 99 1 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 1 3 2 5 4 10 1 5 3 Output 1 Note Consider the\nfirst example. Arkady woke up three times. The first time he saw a stop with\nlines \n    1\n, \n    4\n, \n    6\n. The second time he saw a stop with lines\n\n    1\n, \n    4\n. The third time he saw a stop with lines \n    10\n, \n    5\n,\n\n    6\n, \n    4\n and \n    1\n. He can be in a tram of one of two lines: \n    1\n\nor \n    4\n.\n\n",
