        "description": "Today is an important day for chef Tonio \u2014 an auditor has arrived in his\nhometown of Morioh. He has also arrived at Tonio's restaurant and ordered\ndessert. Tonio has not been prepared for this turn of events. As you know,\ndessert is a string of lowercase English letters. Tonio remembered the rule of\ndesserts \u2014 a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n. Any dessert \n    t\n is\ndelicious if the number of occurrences of \n    t\n in \n    s\n as a substring is\ndivisible by the length of \n    t\n. Now Tonio wants to know the number of\ndelicious substrings of \n    s\n. If the substring occurs several times in the\nstring \n    s\n, then all occurrences must be taken into account. Input The\nfirst line contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the\nlength of the rule \n    s\n. The second line contains the string \n    s\n of\nlength \n    n\n \u2014 the rule. The rule consists only of lowercase English\nletters. Output In a single line print the number of delicious substrings of\n\n    s\n. Examples Input 7 abacaba Output 11 Input 8 abaababa Output 11 Input\n10 deadinside Output 12 Input 5 aaaaa Output 12 Note In the first sample,\nthere are many delicious substrings. \n    7\n of them are substrings of length\n\n    1\n (because any number is divisible by \n    1\n). Consider other delicious\nsubstrings: \"ab\" occurs in \n    s\n \n    2\n times, which is divisible by the\nlength of the substring. \"ba\" also occurs \n    2\n times. Therefore, the answer\nis \n    7 + 2 + 2 = 11\n. Note that the answer includes both occurrences of\n\"ab\" and \"ba\".\n\n",
