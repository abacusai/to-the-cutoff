        "description": "It's our faculty's 34th anniversary! To celebrate this great event, the\nFaculty of Computer Science, University of Indonesia (Fasilkom), held CPC -\nColoring Pavements Competition. The gist of CPC is two players color the\npredetermined routes of Fasilkom in Blue and Red. There are \n    N\n\nCheckpoints and \n    M\n undirected predetermined routes. Routes \n    i\n\nconnects checkpoint \n    U_i\n and \n    V_i\n, for \n    (1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 M)\n. It\nis guaranteed that any pair of checkpoints are connected by using one or more\nroutes. The rules of CPC is as follows: Two players play in each round. One\nplayer plays as blue, the other plays as red. For simplicity, let's call these\nplayers \n    Blue\n and \n    Red\n. \n    Blue\n will color every route in he\nwalks on blue, \n    Red\n will color the route he walks on red. Both players\nstart at checkpoint number \n    1\n. Initially, all routes are gray. Each\nphase, from their current checkpoint, \n    Blue\n and \n    Red\n select a\ndifferent gray route and moves to the checkpoint on the other end of the route\nsimultaneously. The game ends when \n    Blue\n or \n    Red\n can no longer move.\nThat is, there is no two distinct gray routes they can choose to continue\nmoving. Chaneka is interested in participating. However, she does not want to\nwaste much energy. So, She is only interested in the number of final\nconfigurations of the routes after each round. Turns out, counting this is\nalso exhausting, so Chaneka asks you to figure this out! Two final\nconfigurations are considered different if there is a route \n    U\n in a\ndifferent color in the two configurations. Input The first line contains two\nintegers \n    N\n and \n    M\n. \n    N\n \n    (2 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^3)\n\ndenotes the number of checkpoints, \n    M\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 M \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 N)\n\ndenotes the number of routes. It is guaranteed that every checkpoint except\ncheckpoint \n    1\n has exactly two routes connecting it. The next \n    M\n\nlines each contains two integers \n    U_i\n and \n    V_i\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 U_i, V_i\n    \n    \u2264 N, U_i \n     V_i)\n, which denotes the checkpoint that route \n    i\n\nconnects. It is guaranteed that for every pair of checkpoints, there exists a\npath connecting them directly or indirectly using the routes. Output Output a\nsingle integer which denotes the number of final configurations after each\nround of CPC modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n Example Input 5 6 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 1 1 5 5 1\nOutput 8 Note Every possible final configuration for the example is listed\nbelow: The blue-colored numbers give the series of moves \n    Blue\n took, and\nthe red-colored numbers give the series of moves \n    Red\n took.\n\n",
