        "description": "Life has been discovered on Venus! What is more, the life forms appear to be\nconvex polygons. An international consortium is designing a probe to send to\nVenus to take pictures, but they need to estimate the bandwidth needed to send\nback pictures. When the probe takes a picture of a life form and wishes to\nsend it back to Earth, the bandwidth required is proportional to the area of\nthe bounding box (in other words, the smallest axis-aligned rectangle that\ncontains the life-form). The shape and size of the life forms are known, but\nthe orientation relative to the camera is random. You must thus determine the\nexpected (average) area of the bounding box across all orientations. Input The\ninput describes the shape of a life form as a convex polygon in two\ndimensions. The first line of input contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 200\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of vertices. The remaining \n    n\n lines\neach contain two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) \u2014 the coordinates of a vertex. The vertices are given in\ncounterclockwise order, and no three vertices lie on a straight line. Output\nOutput a single line containing the expected area of the bounding box of the\npolygon. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most\n\n    10^-6\n. Examples Input 4 0 0 10 0 10 10 0 10 Output 163.661977237 Input\n5 0 0 10 0 15 8 5 20 -5 7 Output 365.666028588 Note The pictures show example\nlife forms and various camera orientations.\n\n",
