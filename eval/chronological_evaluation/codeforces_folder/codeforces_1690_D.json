        "description": "You have a stripe of checkered paper of length \n    n\n. Each cell is either\nwhite or black. What is the minimum number of cells that must be recolored\nfrom white to black in order to have a segment of \n    k\n consecutive black\ncells on the stripe? If the input data is such that a segment of \n    k\n\nconsecutive black cells already exists, then print 0. Input The first line\ncontains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. Next, descriptions of \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of the\ninput contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n). The second line consists of the letters 'W' (white) and 'B'\n(black). The line length is \n    n\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of values\n\n    n\n does not exceed \n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For each of \n    t\n test\ncases print an integer \u2014 the minimum number of cells that need to be repainted\nfrom white to black in order to have a segment of \n    k\n consecutive black\ncells. Example Input 4 5 3 BBWBW 5 5 BBWBW 5 1 BBWBW 1 1 W Output 1 2 0 1 Note\nIn the first test case, \n    s\n=\"BBWBW\" and \n    k=3\n. It is enough to recolor\n\n    s_3\n and get \n    s\n=\"BBBBW\". This string contains a segment of length\n\n    k=3\n consisting of the letters 'B'. In the second test case of the\nexample \n    s\n=\"BBWBW\" and \n    k=5\n. It is enough to recolor \n    s_3\n and\n\n    s_5\n and get \n    s\n=\"BBBBB\". This string contains a segment of length\n\n    k=5\n consisting of the letters 'B'. In the third test case of the example\n\n    s\n=\"BBWBW\" and \n    k=1\n. The string \n    s\n already contains a segment\nof length \n    k=1\n consisting of the letters 'B'.\n\n",
