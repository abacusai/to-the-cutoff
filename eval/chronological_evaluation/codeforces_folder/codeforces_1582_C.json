        "name": "Grandma Capa Knits a Scarf",
        "description": "Grandma Capa has decided to knit a scarf and asked Grandpa Sher to make a\npattern for it, a pattern is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.\nGrandpa Sher wrote a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n. Grandma Capa wants to\nknit a beautiful scarf, and in her opinion, a beautiful scarf can only be knit\nfrom a string that is a palindrome. She wants to change the pattern written by\nGrandpa Sher, but to avoid offending him, she will choose one lowercase\nEnglish letter and erase some (at her choice, possibly none or all)\noccurrences of that letter in string \n    s\n. She also wants to minimize the\nnumber of erased symbols from the pattern. Please help her and find the\nminimum number of symbols she can erase to make string \n    s\n a palindrome,\nor tell her that it's impossible. Notice that she can only erase symbols equal\nto the one letter she chose. A string is a palindrome if it is the same from\nthe left to the right and from the right to the left. For example, the strings\n'kek', 'abacaba', 'r' and 'papicipap' are palindromes, while the strings 'abb'\nand 'iq' are not. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The next \n    2 \n    \u00b7 t\n\nlines contain the description of test cases. The description of each test case\nconsists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the string. The\nsecond line of each test case contains the string \n    s\n consisting of\n\n    n\n lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n\nover all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test\ncase print the minimum number of erased symbols required to make the string a\npalindrome, if it is possible, and \n    -1\n, if it is impossible. Example\nInput 5 8 abcaacab 6 xyzxyz 4 abba 8 rprarlap 10 khyyhhyhky Output 2 -1 0 3 2\nNote In the first test case, you can choose a letter 'a' and erase its first\nand last occurrences, you will get a string 'bcaacb', which is a palindrome.\nYou can also choose a letter 'b' and erase all its occurrences, you will get a\nstring 'acaaca', which is a palindrome as well. In the second test case, it\ncan be shown that it is impossible to choose a letter and erase some of its\noccurrences to get a palindrome. In the third test case, you don't have to\nerase any symbols because the string is already a palindrome.\n\n",
