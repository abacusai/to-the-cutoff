        "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. They start with a positive integer \n    n\n\nand take alternating turns doing operations on it. Each turn a player can\nsubtract from \n    n\n one of its divisors that isn't \n    1\n or \n    n\n. The\nplayer who cannot make a move on his/her turn loses. Alice always moves first.\nNote that they subtract a divisor of the current number in each turn. You are\nasked to find out who will win the game if both players play optimally. Input\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. Each test\ncase contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the\ninitial number. Output For each test case output \"Alice\" if Alice will win the\ngame or \"Bob\" if Bob will win, if both players play optimally. Example Input 4\n1 4 12 69 Output Bob Alice Alice Bob Note In the first test case, the game\nends immediately because Alice cannot make a move. In the second test case,\nAlice can subtract \n    2\n making \n    n = 2\n, then Bob cannot make a move so\nAlice wins. In the third test case, Alice can subtract \n    3\n so that \n    n =\n    9\n. Bob's only move is to subtract \n    3\n and make \n    n = 6\n. Now, Alice\ncan subtract \n    3\n again and \n    n = 3\n. Then Bob cannot make a move, so\nAlice wins.\n\n",
