        "description": "While swimming at the beach, Mike has accidentally dropped his cellphone into\nthe water. There was no worry as he bought a cheap replacement phone with an\nold-fashioned keyboard. The keyboard has only ten digital equal-sized keys,\nlocated in the following way: Together with his old phone, he lost all his\ncontacts and now he can only remember the way his fingers moved when he put\nsome number in. One can formally consider finger movements as a sequence of\nvectors connecting centers of keys pressed consecutively to put in a number.\nFor example, the finger movements for number \"586\" are the same as finger\nmovements for number \"253\": Mike has already put in a number by his \"finger\nmemory\" and started calling it, so he is now worrying, can he be sure that he\nis calling the correct number? In other words, is there any other number, that\nhas the same finger movements? Input The first line of the input contains the\nonly integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 9) \u2014 the number of digits in the phone number that\nMike put in. The second line contains the string consisting of n digits\n(characters from '0' to '9') representing the number that Mike put in. Output\nIf there is no other phone number with the same finger movements and Mike can\nbe sure he is calling the correct number, print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the\nonly line. Otherwise print \"NO\" (without quotes) in the first line. Examples\nInput 3 586 Output NO Input 2 09 Output NO Input 9 123456789 Output YES Input\n3 911 Output YES Note You can find the picture clarifying the first sample\ncase in the statement above.\n\n",
