        "description": "Ivan has n different boxes. The first of them contains some balls of n\ndifferent colors. Ivan wants to play a strange game. He wants to distribute\nthe balls into boxes in such a way that for every i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) i-th box will\ncontain all balls with color i. In order to do this, Ivan will make some\nturns. Each turn he does the following: Ivan chooses any non-empty box and\ntakes all balls from this box; Then Ivan chooses any k empty boxes (the box\nfrom the first step becomes empty, and Ivan is allowed to choose it),\nseparates the balls he took on the previous step into k non-empty groups and\nputs each group into one of the boxes. He should put each group into a\nseparate box. He can choose either k = 2 or k = 3. The penalty of the turn is\nthe number of balls Ivan takes from the box during the first step of the turn.\nAnd penalty of the game is the total penalty of turns made by Ivan until he\ndistributes all balls to corresponding boxes. Help Ivan to determine the\nminimum possible penalty of the game! Input The first line contains one\ninteger number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200000) \u2014 the number of boxes and colors. The second\nline contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^9), where ai is\nthe number of balls with color i. Output Print one number \u2014 the minimum\npossible penalty of the game. Examples Input 3 1 2 3 Output 6 Input 4 2 3 4 5\nOutput 19 Note In the first example you take all the balls from the first box,\nchoose k = 3 and sort all colors to corresponding boxes. Penalty is 6. In the\nsecond example you make two turns: Take all the balls from the first box,\nchoose k = 3, put balls of color 3 to the third box, of color 4 \u2014 to the\nfourth box and the rest put back into the first box. Penalty is 14; Take all\nthe balls from the first box, choose k = 2, put balls of color 1 to the first\nbox, of color 2 \u2014 to the second box. Penalty is 5. Total penalty is 19.\n\n",
