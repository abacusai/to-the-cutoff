        "description": "Polycarp is going to participate in the contest. It starts at \n    h_1:m_1\n\nand ends at \n    h_2:m_2\n. It is guaranteed that the contest lasts an even\nnumber of minutes (i.e. \n    m_1 \n    % 2 = m_2 \n    % 2\n, where \n    x \n    % y\n is\n\n    x\n modulo \n    y\n). It is also guaranteed that the entire contest is held\nduring a single day. And finally it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at\nleast two minutes. Polycarp wants to know the time of the midpoint of the\ncontest. For example, if the contest lasts from \n    10:00\n to \n    11:00\n\nthen the answer is \n    10:30\n, if the contest lasts from \n    11:10\n to\n\n    11:12\n then the answer is \n    11:11\n. Input The first line of the input\ncontains two integers \n    h_1\n and \n    m_1\n in the format hh:mm. The second\nline of the input contains two integers \n    h_2\n and \n    m_2\n in the same\nformat (hh:mm). It is guaranteed that \n    0 \n    \u2264 h_1, h_2 \n    \u2264 23\n and \n    0\n    \n    \u2264 m_1, m_2 \n    \u2264 59\n. It is guaranteed that the contest lasts an even\nnumber of minutes (i.e. \n    m_1 \n    % 2 = m_2 \n    % 2\n, where \n    x \n    % y\n is\n\n    x\n modulo \n    y\n). It is also guaranteed that the entire contest is held\nduring a single day. And finally it is guaranteed that the contest lasts at\nleast two minutes. Output Print two integers \n    h_3\n and \n    m_3\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 h_3 \n    \u2264 23, 0 \n    \u2264 m_3 \n    \u2264 59\n) corresponding to the midpoint of\nthe contest in the format hh:mm. Print each number as exactly two digits\n(prepend a number with leading zero if needed), separate them with ':'.\nExamples Input 10:00 11:00 Output 10:30 Input 11:10 11:12 Output 11:11 Input\n01:02 03:02 Output 02:02\n\n",
