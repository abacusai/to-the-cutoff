        "description": "Vittorio is playing with his new LEGO Duplo bricks. All the bricks have the\nshape of a square cuboid with a \n    2 \n    \u00d7 2\n square base and a height of\n\n    1\n. They can be arranged in the 3D space to build structures, provided\nthat the following rules are met: No two bricks can intersect, but they can\ntouch on their faces. The corners of every brick must have integer coordinates\n(so bricks are axis-aligned) and the \n    z\n coordinates of all corners must\nbe non-negative. The square bases of every brick must be parallel to the\nground (i.e. the plane \n    z=0\n). The lower base of any brick that is not\ntouching the ground must touch the upper base of some other brick in a region\nof positive area (when this happens, the two bricks stay attached to each\nother thanks to small studs).For example, this is a valid structure: Vittorio\nwants to build a structure that includes purple bricks in the following\n\n    n\n positions: \n    (x_1, 0, h)\n, \n    (x_2, 0, h)\n, \n    \u2026\n,\n\n    (x_n, 0, h)\n \u2014 these are the coordinates of the centers of their lower\nbases; note that all of these bricks have \n    y\n coordinate equal to \n    0\n\nand \n    z\n coordinate equal to \n    h\n. Vittorio will use additional bricks\nof other colors to support the purple bricks. He is willing to place bricks\nonly in positions where the center of the lower base has \n    y\n coordinate\nequal to \n    0\n. What is the minimum number of additional bricks needed? It\ncan be shown that a valid construction always exists. Input The first line\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    h\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 300\n, \n    0\n    \n    \u2264 h \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of purple bricks and their common \n    z\n\ncoordinate. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    x_1, \n      x_2, \n     \n    \u2026, \n      x_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    x_i + 1 < x_i+1\n) \u2014\nthe \n    x\n coordinates of the purple bricks (centers of the bases), given in\nincreasing order. Output Print the minimum number of additional bricks needed.\nExamples Input 4 0 2 7 11 13 Output 0 Input 4 1 2 7 11 13 Output 3 Input 4 100\n2 7 11 13 Output 107 Input 4 3 2 5 8 11 Output 8 Note In the first sample, all\nthe purple bricks lie on the ground, so no additional bricks are needed. In\nthe second sample, Vittorio will have to place supporting bricks under the\npurple bricks, and he can use a single brick to support both the third and the\nfourth purple bricks. For example, he can place additional bricks at positions\n\n    (3, 0, 0)\n, \n    (7, 0, 0)\n and \n    (12, 0, 0)\n. It can be shown that it\nis impossible to build a valid construction using less than \n    3\n additional\nbricks. In the fourth sample, a possible structure that minimizes the number\nof additional bricks is shown in the problem description.\n\n",
