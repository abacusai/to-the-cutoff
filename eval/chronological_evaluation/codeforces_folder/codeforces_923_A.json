        "description": "Alice and Bob begin their day with a quick game. They first choose a starting\nnumber X0 \u2265 3 and try to reach one million by the process described below.\nAlice goes first and then they take alternating turns. In the i-th turn, the\nplayer whose turn it is selects a prime number smaller than the current\nnumber, and announces the smallest multiple of this prime number that is not\nsmaller than the current number. Formally, he or she selects a prime p < Xi -\n1 and then finds the minimum Xi \u2265 Xi - 1 such that p divides Xi. Note that if\nthe selected prime p already divides Xi - 1, then the number does not change.\nEve has witnessed the state of the game after two turns. Given X2, help her\ndetermine what is the smallest possible starting number X0. Note that the\nplayers don't necessarily play optimally. You should consider all possible\ngame evolutions. Input The input contains a single integer X2 (4 \u2264 X2 \u2264 10^6).\nIt is guaranteed that the integer X2 is composite, that is, is not prime.\nOutput Output a single integer \u2014 the minimum possible X0. Examples Input 14\nOutput 6 Input 20 Output 15 Input 8192 Output 8191 Note In the first test, the\nsmallest possible starting number is X0 = 6. One possible course of the game\nis as follows: Alice picks prime 5 and announces X1 = 10 Bob picks prime 7 and\nannounces X2 = 14. In the second case, let X0 = 15. Alice picks prime 2 and\nannounces X1 = 16 Bob picks prime 5 and announces X2 = 20.\n\n",
