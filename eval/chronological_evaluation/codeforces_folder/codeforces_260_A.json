        "description": "Vasya has got two number: a and b. However, Vasya finds number a too short. So\nhe decided to repeat the operation of lengthening number a n times. One\noperation of lengthening a number means adding exactly one digit to the number\n(in the decimal notation) to the right provided that the resulting number is\ndivisible by Vasya's number b. If it is impossible to obtain the number which\nis divisible by b, then the lengthening operation cannot be performed. Your\ntask is to help Vasya and print the number he can get after applying the\nlengthening operation to number a n times. Input The first line contains three\nintegers: a, b, n (1 \u2264 a, b, n \u2264 10^5). Output In a single line print the\ninteger without leading zeros, which Vasya can get when he applies the\nlengthening operations to number a n times. If no such number exists, then\nprint number -1. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them.\nExamples Input 5 4 5 Output 524848 Input 12 11 1 Output 121 Input 260 150 10\nOutput -1\n\n",
