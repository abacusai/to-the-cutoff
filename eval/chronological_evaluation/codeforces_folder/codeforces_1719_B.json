        "description": "A new entertainment has appeared in Buryatia \u2014 a mathematical circus! The\nmagician shows two numbers to the audience \u2014 \n    n\n and \n    k\n, where\n\n    n\n is even. Next, he takes all the integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, and\nsplits them all into pairs \n    (a, b)\n (each integer must be in exactly one\npair) so that for each pair the integer \n    (a + k) \n    \u00b7 b\n is divisible\nby \n    4\n (note that the order of the numbers in the pair matters), or\nreports that, unfortunately for viewers, such a split is impossible. Burenka\nreally likes such performances, so she asked her friend Tonya to be a\nmagician, and also gave him the numbers \n    n\n and \n    k\n. Tonya is a wolf,\nand as you know, wolves do not perform in the circus, even in a mathematical\none. Therefore, he asks you to help him. Let him know if a suitable splitting\ninto pairs is possible, and if possible, then tell it. Input The first line\ncontains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The following is a description of the input data sets. The single\nline of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264\n    n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    n\n is even) \u2014\nthe number of integers and the number being added \n    k\n. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, first output the string \"YES\" if there is\na split into pairs, and \"NO\" if there is none. If there is a split, then in\nthe following \n    n/2\n lines output pairs of the split, in each\nline print \n    2\n numbers \u2014 first the integer \n    a\n, then the integer\n\n    b\n. Example Input 4 4 1 2 0 12 10 14 11 Output YES 1 2 3 4 NO YES 3 4 7 8\n11 12 2 1 6 5 10 9 YES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Note In the first test\ncase, splitting into pairs \n    (1, 2)\n and \n    (3, 4)\n is suitable, same as\nsplitting into \n    (1, 4)\n and \n    (3, 2)\n. In the second test case, \n    (1 +\n    0) \n    \u00b7 2 = 1 \n    \u00b7 (2 + 0) = 2\n is not divisible by \n    4\n, so there\nis no partition.\n\n",
