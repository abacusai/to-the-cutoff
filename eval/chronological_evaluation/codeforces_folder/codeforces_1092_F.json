        "description": "You are given a tree consisting exactly of \n    n\n vertices. Tree is a\nconnected undirected graph with \n    n-1\n edges. Each vertex \n    v\n of this\ntree has a value \n    a_v\n assigned to it. Let \n    dist(x, y)\n be the\ndistance between the vertices \n    x\n and \n    y\n. The distance between the\nvertices is the number of edges on the simple path between them. Let's define\nthe cost of the tree as the following value: firstly, let's fix some vertex of\nthe tree. Let it be \n    v\n. Then the cost of the tree is\n\n    \u2211\n    _i = 1^n dist(i, v) \n    \u00b7 a_i\n. Your task is to\ncalculate the maximum possible cost of the tree if you can choose \n    v\n\narbitrarily. Input The first line contains one integer \n    n\n, the number of\nvertices in the tree (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The second line\nof the input contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n), where \n    a_i\n is the value of the vertex\n\n    i\n. Each of the next \n    n - 1\n lines describes an edge of the tree.\nEdge \n    i\n is denoted by two integers \n    u_i\n and \n    v_i\n, the labels of\nvertices it connects (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    u_i \n     v_i\n). It\nis guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. Output Print one integer \u2014 the\nmaximum possible cost of the tree if you can choose any vertex as \n    v\n.\nExamples Input 8 9 4 1 7 10 1 6 5 1 2 2 3 1 4 1 5 5 6 5 7 5 8 Output 121 Input\n1 1337 Output 0 Note Picture corresponding to the first example: You can\nchoose the vertex \n    3\n as a root, then the answer will be \n    2 \n    \u00b7 9 +\n    1 \n    \u00b7 4 + 0 \n    \u00b7 1 + 3 \n    \u00b7 7 + 3 \n    \u00b7 10 + 4 \n    \u00b7 1 + 4\n    \n    \u00b7 6 + 4 \n    \u00b7 5 = 18 + 4 + 0 + 21 + 30 + 4 + 24 + 20 = 121\n. In the\nsecond example tree consists only of one vertex so the answer is always\n\n    0\n.\n\n",
