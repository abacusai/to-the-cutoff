        "description": "A camera you have accidentally left in a desert has taken an interesting\nphoto. The photo has a resolution of n pixels width, and each column of this\nphoto is all white or all black. Thus, we can represent the photo as a\nsequence of n zeros and ones, where 0 means that the corresponding column is\nall white, and 1 means that the corresponding column is black. You think that\nthis photo can contain a zebra. In this case the whole photo should consist of\nseveral (possibly, only one) alternating black and white stripes of equal\nwidth. For example, the photo [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] can be a photo of\nzebra, while the photo [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] can not, because the width of the\nblack stripe is 3, while the width of the white stripe is 4. Can the given\nphoto be a photo of zebra or not? Input The first line contains a single\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the width of the photo. The second line contains\na sequence of integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 1) \u2014 the description of the\nphoto. If ai is zero, the i-th column is all black. If ai is one, then the\ni-th column is all white. Output If the photo can be a photo of zebra, print\n\"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, print \"NO\". You can print each letter in\nany case (upper or lower). Examples Input 9 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 Output YES Input\n7 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 Output NO Input 5 1 1 1 1 1 Output YES Input 8 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1\nOutput NO Input 9 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 Output NO Note The first two examples are\ndescribed in the statements. In the third example all pixels are white, so the\nphoto can be a photo of zebra. In the fourth example the width of the first\nstripe is equal to three (white color), the width of the second stripe is\nequal to three (black), and the width of the third stripe is equal to two\n(white). Thus, not all stripes have equal length, so this photo is not a photo\nof zebra.\n\n",
