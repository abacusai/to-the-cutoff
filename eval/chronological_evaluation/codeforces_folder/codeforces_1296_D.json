        "description": "There are \n    n\n monsters standing in a row numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n.\nThe \n    i\n-th monster has \n    h_i\n health points (hp). You have your attack\npower equal to \n    a\n hp and your opponent has his attack power equal to\n\n    b\n hp. You and your opponent are fighting these monsters. Firstly, you\nand your opponent go to the first monster and fight it till his death, then\nyou and your opponent go the second monster and fight it till his death, and\nso on. A monster is considered dead if its hp is less than or equal to\n\n    0\n. The fight with a monster happens in turns. You hit the monster by\n\n    a\n hp. If it is dead after your hit, you gain one point and you both\nproceed to the next monster. Your opponent hits the monster by \n    b\n hp. If\nit is dead after his hit, nobody gains a point and you both proceed to the\nnext monster. You have some secret technique to force your opponent to skip\nhis turn. You can use this technique at most \n    k\n times in total (for\nexample, if there are two monsters and \n    k=4\n, then you can use the\ntechnique \n    2\n times on the first monster and \n    1\n time on the second\nmonster, but not \n    2\n times on the first monster and \n    3\n times on the\nsecond monster). Your task is to determine the maximum number of points you\ncan gain if you use the secret technique optimally. Input The first line of\nthe input contains four integers \n    n, a, b\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5, 1 \n    \u2264 a, b, k \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of monsters, your\nattack power, the opponent's attack power and the number of times you can use\nthe secret technique. The second line of the input contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    h_1, h_2, \n    \u2026, h_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 h_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n), where \n    h_i\n\nis the health points of the \n    i\n-th monster. Output Print one integer \u2014 the\nmaximum number of points you can gain if you use the secret technique\noptimally. Examples Input 6 2 3 3 7 10 50 12 1 8 Output 5 Input 1 1 100 99 100\nOutput 1 Input 7 4 2 1 1 3 5 4 2 7 6 Output 6\n\n",
