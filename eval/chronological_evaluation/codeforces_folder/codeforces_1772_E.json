        "description": "Two players are playing a game. They have a permutation of integers \n    1\n,\n\n    2\n, ..., \n    n\n (a permutation is an array where each element from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n occurs exactly once). The permutation is not sorted in\neither ascending or descending order (i. e. the permutation does not have the\nform \n    [1, 2, \n    \u2026, n]\n or \n    [n, n-1, \n    \u2026, 1]\n). Initially, all\nelements of the permutation are colored red. The players take turns. On their\nturn, the player can do one of three actions: rearrange the elements of the\npermutation in such a way that all red elements keep their positions (note\nthat blue elements can be swapped with each other, but it's not obligatory);\nchange the color of one red element to blue; skip the turn. The first player\nwins if the permutation is sorted in ascending order (i. e. it becomes \n    [1,\n    2, \n    \u2026, n]\n). The second player wins if the permutation is sorted in\ndescending order (i. e. it becomes \n    [n, n-1, \n    \u2026, 1]\n). If the game\nlasts for \n    100^500\n turns and nobody wins, it ends in a draw. Your task\nis to determine the result of the game if both players play optimally. Input\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5\n)\n\u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the size of the\npermutation. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026,\n    p_n\n \u2014 the permutation itself. The permutation \n    p\n is not sorted in\neither ascending or descending order. The sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print First\nif the first player wins, Second if the second player wins, and Tie if the\nresult is a draw. Example Input 4 4 1 2 4 3 3 2 3 1 5 3 4 5 2 1 6 1 5 6 3 2 4\nOutput First Tie Second Tie Note Let's show how the first player wins in the\nfirst example. They should color the elements \n    3\n and \n    4\n blue during\ntheir first two turns, and then they can reorder the blue elements in such a\nway that the permutation becomes \n    [1, 2, 3, 4]\n. The second player can\nneither interfere with this strategy nor win faster.\n\n",
