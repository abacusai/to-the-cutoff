        "description": "You are given two positive integer numbers x and y. An array F is called an\ny-factorization of x iff the following conditions are met: There are y\nelements in F, and all of them are integer numbers; . You have to count the\nnumber of pairwise distinct arrays that are y-factorizations of x. Two arrays\nA and B are considered different iff there exists at least one index i (1 \u2264 i\n\u2264 y) such that Ai \u2260 Bi. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo\n10^9 + 7. Input The first line contains one integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the\nnumber of testcases to solve. Then q lines follow, each containing two\nintegers xi and yi (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 10^6). Each of these lines represents a\ntestcase. Output Print q integers. i-th integer has to be equal to the number\nof yi-factorizations of xi modulo 10^9 + 7. Example Input 2 6 3 4 2 Output 36\n6 Note In the second testcase of the example there are six y-factorizations: \n- 4, - 1;  - 2, - 2;  - 1, - 4; 1, 4; 2, 2; 4, 1.\n\n",
