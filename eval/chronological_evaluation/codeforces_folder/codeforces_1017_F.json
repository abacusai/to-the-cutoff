        "description": "Notice: unusual memory limit! After the war, destroyed cities in the neutral\nzone were restored. And children went back to school. The war changed the\nworld, as well as education. In those hard days, a new math concept was\ncreated. As we all know, logarithm function can be described as: \n    \n\n    log(p_1^a_1p_2^a_2...p_k^a_2) = a_1 \n    log p_1 + a_2 \n    log p_2 + ...\n    + a_k \n    log p_k\n\n    \n Where \n    p_1^a_1p_2^a_2...p_k^a_2\n is the\nprime factorization of a integer. A problem is that the function uses itself\nin the definition. That is why it is hard to calculate. So, the mathematicians\nfrom the neutral zone invented this: \n    \n\n    exlog_f(p_1^a_1p_2^a_2...p_k^a_2) = a_1 f(p_1) + a_2 f(p_2) +\n    ... + a_k f(p_k)\n\n    \n Notice that \n    exlog_f(1)\n is always equal\nto \n    0\n. This concept for any function \n    f\n was too hard for children.\nSo teachers told them that \n    f\n can only be a polynomial of degree no more\nthan \n    3\n in daily uses (i.e., \n    f(x) = Ax^3+Bx^2+Cx+D\n). \"Class is\nover! Don't forget to do your homework!\" Here it is: \n    \n\n    \u2211_i=1^n\n    \n    exlog_f(i)\n\n    \n Help children to do their homework. Since the value\ncan be very big, you need to find the answer modulo \n    2^32\n. Input The\nonly line contains five integers \n    n\n, \n    A\n, \n    B\n, \n    C\n, and\n\n    D\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 3 \n    \u00b7 10^8\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 A,B,C,D \n    \u2264\n    10^6\n). Output Print the answer modulo \n    2^32\n.
