        "description": "In Absurdistan, there are n towns (numbered 1 through n) and m bidirectional\nrailways. There is also an absurdly simple road network \u2014 for each pair of\ndifferent towns x and y, there is a bidirectional road between towns x and y\nif and only if there is no railway between them. Travelling to a different\ntown using one railway or one road always takes exactly one hour. A train and\na bus leave town 1 at the same time. They both have the same destination, town\nn, and don't make any stops on the way (but they can wait in town n). The\ntrain can move only along railways and the bus can move only along roads.\nYou've been asked to plan out routes for the vehicles; each route can use any\nroad/railway multiple times. One of the most important aspects to consider is\nsafety \u2014 in order to avoid accidents at railway crossings, the train and the\nbus must not arrive at the same town (except town n) simultaneously. Under\nthese constraints, what is the minimum number of hours needed for both\nvehicles to reach town n (the maximum of arrival times of the bus and the\ntrain)? Note, that bus and train are not required to arrive to the town n at\nthe same moment of time, but are allowed to do so. Input The first line of the\ninput contains two integers n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 400, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n(n - 1) / 2) \u2014 the\nnumber of towns and the number of railways respectively. Each of the next m\nlines contains two integers u and v, denoting a railway between towns u and v\n(1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n, u \u2260 v). You may assume that there is at most one railway\nconnecting any two towns. Output Output one integer \u2014 the smallest possible\ntime of the later vehicle's arrival in town n. If it's impossible for at least\none of the vehicles to reach town n, output - 1. Examples Input 4 2 1 3 3 4\nOutput 2 Input 4 6 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 3 2 4 3 4 Output -1 Input 5 5 4 2 3 5 4 5 5 1\n1 2 Output 3 Note In the first sample, the train can take the route and the\nbus can take the route . Note that they can arrive at town 4 at the same time.\nIn the second sample, Absurdistan is ruled by railwaymen. There are no roads,\nso there's no way for the bus to reach town 4.\n\n",
