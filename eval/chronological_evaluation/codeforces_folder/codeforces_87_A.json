        "description": "Vasya the programmer lives in the middle of the Programming subway branch. He\nhas two girlfriends: Dasha and Masha, who live at the different ends of the\nbranch, each one is unaware of the other one's existence. When Vasya has some\nfree time, he goes to one of his girlfriends. He descends into the subway at\nsome time, waits the first train to come and rides on it to the end of the\nbranch to the corresponding girl. However, the trains run with different\nfrequencies: a train goes to Dasha's direction every a minutes, but a train\ngoes to Masha's direction every b minutes. If two trains approach at the same\ntime, Vasya goes toward the direction with the lower frequency of going\ntrains, that is, to the girl, to whose directions the trains go less\nfrequently (see the note to the third sample). We know that the trains begin\nto go simultaneously before Vasya appears. That is the train schedule is such\nthat there exists a moment of time when the two trains arrive simultaneously.\nHelp Vasya count to which girlfriend he will go more often. Input The first\nline contains two integers a and b (a \u2260 b, 1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 10^6). Output Print\n\"Dasha\" if Vasya will go to Dasha more frequently, \"Masha\" if he will go to\nMasha more frequently, or \"Equal\" if he will go to both girlfriends with the\nsame frequency. Examples Input 3 7 Output Dasha Input 5 3 Output Masha Input 2\n3 Output Equal Note Let's take a look at the third sample. Let the trains\nstart to go at the zero moment of time. It is clear that the moments of the\ntrains' arrival will be periodic with period 6. That's why it is enough to\nshow that if Vasya descends to the subway at a moment of time inside the\ninterval (0, 6], he will go to both girls equally often. If he descends to the\nsubway at a moment of time from 0 to 2, he leaves for Dasha on the train that\narrives by the second minute. If he descends to the subway at a moment of time\nfrom 2 to 3, he leaves for Masha on the train that arrives by the third\nminute. If he descends to the subway at a moment of time from 3 to 4, he\nleaves for Dasha on the train that arrives by the fourth minute. If he\ndescends to the subway at a moment of time from 4 to 6, he waits for both\ntrains to arrive by the sixth minute and goes to Masha as trains go less often\nin Masha's direction. In sum Masha and Dasha get equal time \u2014 three minutes\nfor each one, thus, Vasya will go to both girlfriends equally often.\n\n",
