        "description": "Eugene got Burenka an array \n    a\n of length \n    n\n of integers from \n    1\n\nto \n    m\n for her birthday. Burenka knows that Eugene really likes coprime\nintegers (integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n such that they have only one common\nfactor (equal to \n    1\n)) so she wants to to ask Eugene \n    q\n questions\nabout the present. Each time Burenka will choose a subsegment \n    a_l, a_l +\n    1, \n    \u2026, a_r\n of array \n    a\n, and compute the product of these\nnumbers \n    p = a_l \n    \u00b7 a_l + 1\n    \u00b7\n    \u2026\n    \u00b7 a_r\n. Then she\nwill ask Eugene to count the number of integers between \n    1\n and \n    C\n\ninclusive which are coprime with \n    p\n. Help Eugene answer all the\nquestions! Input In the first line of input there are four integers \n    n\n,\n\n    m\n, \n    C\n, \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, q \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m\n    \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7 10^4\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 C \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the\narray \n    a\n, the maximum possible value of \n    a_i\n, the value \n    C\n,\nand the number of queries. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264 m\n) \u2014 the array \n    a\n . In\nthe next \n    q\n lines the queries are given. Each query consists of two\nintegers \n    l\n and \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n). Output\nPrint \n    q\n integers \u2014 the answers to Burenka's queries. Example Input 5 5 5\n3 1 2 3 2 5 1 1 2 4 4 5 Output 5 2 2 Note Here's an explanation for the\nexample: in the first query, the product is equal to \n    1\n, which is coprime\nwith \n    1,2,3,4,5\n. in the second query, the product is equal to \n    12\n,\nwhich is coprime with \n    1\n and \n    5\n. in the third query, the product is\nequal to \n    10\n, which is coprime with \n    1\n and \n    3\n.\n\n",
