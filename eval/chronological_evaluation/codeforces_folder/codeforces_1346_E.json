        "description": "Masha is going to participate in a talent show conducted by the university she\nstudies at. She wants to impress the audience with lots of different magic\ntricks! For one of her tricks, she uses \n    n\n sponge balls, one of which is\na special one. First, she arranges the balls in a row in such a way that the\nspecial ball is put on position \n    k\n (positions are numbered from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n from left to right). After that, she performs \n    m\n swaps: during\nthe \n    i\n-th swap, she chooses the ball on position \n    x_i\n and the ball\non position \n    y_i\n, and swaps them. Since Masha is a magician, she fakes\nsome of her actions to trick the audience \u2014 when she starts performing a swap,\nshe may fake it, so it is not performed (but it looks like it is performed for\nthe audience). There are no constraints on which swaps Masha should fake or\nshould actually perform \u2014 for example, she may fake all of the swaps, or even\nnot fake anything at all. For the trick to work perfectly, the special ball\nshould end up on a specific position \u2014 Masha has not decided yet, which\nposition is perfect. Since faking swaps is difficult, for each position she\nwants to know the minimum number of swaps she has to fake so that the special\nball ends up there. Unfortunately, Masha is a magician, neither a\nmathematician nor a programmer. So she needs your help in calculating what she\nwants! Input The first line contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n and\n\n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n; \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the number of balls, the number of swaps\nand the initial position of the special ball, respectively. Then \n    m\n lines\nfollow, the \n    i\n-th line contains two integers \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i, y_i \n    \u2264 n\n; \n    x_i \n     y_i\n) denoting the \n    i\n-th\nswap. Output Print \n    n\n integers. The \n    i\n-th integer should be the\nminimum number of swaps Masha has to fake so the special ball ends up on\nposition \n    i\n (or \n    -1\n, if Masha cannot put the special ball there).\nExamples Input 4 5 1 3 4 2 1 4 1 3 1 3 1 Output 2 0 3 1 Input 5 7 4 3 2 3 2 4\n2 3 4 4 1 3 2 5 2 Output 2 2 0 3 1 Input 7 15 5 5 3 4 2 6 1 2 4 1 6 3 7 5 6 4\n2 6 4 2 6 6 3 6 3 7 6 2 6 7 2 Output -1 1 1 1 2 1 0\n\n",
