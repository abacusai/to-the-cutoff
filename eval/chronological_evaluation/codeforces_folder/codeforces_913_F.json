        "name": "Strongly Connected Tournament",
        "description": "There is a chess tournament in All-Right-City. n players were invited to take\npart in the competition. The tournament is held by the following rules:\nInitially, each player plays one game with every other player. There are no\nties; After that, the organizers build a complete directed graph with players\nas vertices. For every pair of players there is exactly one directed edge\nbetween them: the winner of their game is the startpoint of this edge and the\nloser is the endpoint; After that, the organizers build a condensation of this\ngraph. The condensation of this graph is an acyclic complete graph, therefore\nit has the only Hamiltonian path which consists of strongly connected\ncomponents of initial graph A1 \u2192 A2 \u2192 ... \u2192 Ak. The players from the first\ncomponent A1 are placed on the first places, the players from the component A2\nare placed on the next places, and so on. To determine exact place of each\nplayer in a strongly connected component, all the procedures from 1 to 5 are\nrepeated recursively inside each component, i.e. for every i = 1, 2, ..., k\nplayers from the component Ai play games with each other again, and so on; If\na component consists of a single player, then he has no more rivals, his place\nis already determined and the process stops. The players are enumerated with\nintegers from 1 to n. The enumeration was made using results of a previous\ntournament. It is known that player i wins player j (i < j) with probability\np. You need to help to organize the tournament. Find the expected value of\ntotal number of games played by all the players. It can be shown that the\nanswer can be represented as , where P and Q are coprime integers and . Print\nthe value of P\u00b7Q^-1 modulo 998244353. If you are not familiar with any of the\nterms above, you can read about them here. Input The first line of input\ncontains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2000) \u2014 the number of players. The second\nline contains two integers a and b (1 \u2264 a < b \u2264 100) \u2014 the numerator and the\ndenominator of fraction . Output In the only line print the expected value of\ntotal number of games played by all the players. Print the answer using the\nformat above. Examples Input 3 1 2 Output 4 Input 3 4 6 Output 142606340 Input\n4 1 2 Output 598946623 Note In the first example the expected value is 4. In\nthe second example the expected value is . In the third example the expected\nvalue is .\n\n",
