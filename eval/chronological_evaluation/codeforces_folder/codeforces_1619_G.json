        "description": "Polycarp is very fond of playing the game Minesweeper. Recently he found a\nsimilar game and there are such rules. There are mines on the field, for each\nthe coordinates of its location are known (\n    x_i, y_i\n). Each mine has a\nlifetime in seconds, after which it will explode. After the explosion, the\nmine also detonates all mines vertically and horizontally at a distance of\n\n    k\n (two perpendicular lines). As a result, we get an explosion on the\nfield in the form of a \"plus\" symbol ('+'). Thus, one explosion can cause new\nexplosions, and so on. Also, Polycarp can detonate anyone mine every second,\nstarting from zero seconds. After that, a chain reaction of explosions also\ntakes place. Mines explode instantly and also instantly detonate other mines\naccording to the rules described above. Polycarp wants to set a new record and\nasks you to help him calculate in what minimum number of seconds all mines can\nbe detonated. Input The first line of the input contains an integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test. An empty\nline is written in front of each test suite. Next comes a line that contains\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264\n    k \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines\nduring the explosion, respectively. Then \n    n\n lines follow, the \n    i\n-th\nof which describes the \n    x\n and \n    y\n coordinates of the \n    i\n-th mine\nand the time until its explosion (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    0\n    \n    \u2264 timer \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is guaranteed that all mines have different\ncoordinates. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values \n    n\n over all test\ncases in the test does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output Print \n    t\n\nlines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of\ninput data \u2014 the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.\nExample Input 3 5 0 0 0 1 0 1 4 1 0 2 1 1 3 2 2 9 5 2 0 0 1 0 1 4 1 0 2 1 1 3\n2 2 9 6 1 1 -1 3 0 -1 9 0 1 7 -1 0 1 -1 1 9 -1 -1 7 Output 2 1 0 Note Picture\nfrom examples First example: \n    0\n second: we explode a mine at the cell\n\n    (2, 2)\n, it does not detonate any other mine since \n    k=0\n. \n    1\n\nsecond: we explode the mine at the cell \n    (0, 1)\n, and the mine at the cell\n\n    (0, 0)\n explodes itself. \n    2\n second: we explode the mine at the cell\n\n    (1, 1)\n, and the mine at the cell \n    (1, 0)\n explodes itself.Second\nexample: \n    0\n second: we explode a mine at the cell \n    (2, 2)\n we get:\n\n    1\n second: the mine at coordinate \n    (0, 0)\n explodes and since\n\n    k=2\n the explosion detonates mines at the cells \n    (0, 1)\n and \n    (1,\n    0)\n, and their explosions detonate the mine at the cell \n    (1, 1)\n and\nthere are no mines left on the field.\n\n",
