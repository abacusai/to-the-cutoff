        "description": "On a plane are n points (xi, yi) with integer coordinates between 0 and 10^6.\nThe distance between the two points with numbers a and b is said to be the\nfollowing value: (the distance calculated by such formula is called Manhattan\ndistance). We call a hamiltonian path to be some permutation pi of numbers\nfrom 1 to n. We say that the length of this path is value . Find some\nhamiltonian path with a length of no more than 25 \u00d7 10^8. Note that you do not\nhave to minimize the path length. Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264\nn \u2264 10^6). The i + 1-th line contains the coordinates of the i-th point: xi\nand yi (0 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 10^6). It is guaranteed that no two points coincide.\nOutput Print the permutation of numbers pi from 1 to n \u2014 the sought\nHamiltonian path. The permutation must meet the inequality . If there are\nmultiple possible answers, print any of them. It is guaranteed that the answer\nexists. Examples Input 5 0 7 8 10 3 4 5 0 9 12 Output 4 3 1 2 5 Note In the\nsample test the total distance is: (|5 - 3| + |0 - 4|) + (|3 - 0| + |4 - 7|) +\n(|0 - 8| + |7 - 10|) + (|8 - 9| + |10 - 12|) = 2 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 8 + 3 + 1 + 2 =\n26\n\n",
