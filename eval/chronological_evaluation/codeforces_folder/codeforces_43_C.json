        "description": "Vasya thinks that lucky tickets are the tickets whose numbers are divisible by\n3. He gathered quite a large collection of such tickets but one day his\nyounger brother Leonid was having a sulk and decided to destroy the\ncollection. First he tore every ticket exactly in two, but he didn\u2019t think it\nwas enough and Leonid also threw part of the pieces away. Having seen this,\nVasya got terrified but still tried to restore the collection. He chose\nseveral piece pairs and glued each pair together so that each pair formed a\nlucky ticket. The rest of the pieces Vasya threw away reluctantly. Thus, after\nthe gluing of the 2t pieces he ended up with t tickets, each of which was\nlucky. When Leonid tore the tickets in two pieces, one piece contained the\nfirst several letters of his number and the second piece contained the rest.\nVasya can glue every pair of pieces in any way he likes, but it is important\nthat he gets a lucky ticket in the end. For example, pieces 123 and 99 can be\nglued in two ways: 12399 and 99123. What maximum number of tickets could Vasya\nget after that? Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the\nnumber of pieces. The second line contains n space-separated numbers ai (1 \u2264\nai \u2264 10^8) \u2014 the numbers on the pieces. Vasya can only glue the pieces in\npairs. Even if the number of a piece is already lucky, Vasya should glue the\npiece with some other one for it to count as lucky. Vasya does not have to use\nall the pieces. The numbers on the pieces an on the resulting tickets may\ncoincide. Output Print the single number \u2014 the maximum number of lucky tickets\nthat will be able to be restored. Don't forget that every lucky ticket is made\nof exactly two pieces glued together. Examples Input 3 123 123 99 Output 1\nInput 6 1 1 1 23 10 3 Output 1\n\n",
