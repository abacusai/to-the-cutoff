        "name": "Two Arrays",
        "description": "You are given two arrays of integers \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n and\n\n    b_1,b_2,\n    \u2026,b_m\n. Alice and Bob are going to play a game. Alice moves\nfirst and they take turns making a move. They play on a grid of size \n    n\n    \n    \u00d7 m\n (a grid with \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n columns). Initially, there\nis a rook positioned on the first row and first column of the grid. During\nher/his move, a player can do one of the following two operations: Move the\nrook to a different cell on the same row or the same column of the current\ncell. A player cannot move the rook to a cell that has been visited \n    1000\n\ntimes before (i.e., the rook can stay in a certain cell at most \n    1000\n\ntimes during the entire game). Note that the starting cell is considered to be\nvisited once at the beginning of the game. End the game immediately with a\nscore of \n    a_r+b_c\n, where \n    (r, c)\n is the current cell (i.e., the rook\nis on the \n    r\n-th row and \n    c\n-th column). Bob wants to maximize the\nscore while Alice wants to minimize it. If they both play this game optimally,\nwhat is the final score of the game? Input The first line contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n,m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of the arrays \n    a\n and \n    b\n (which coincide with the number of\nrows and columns of the grid). The second line contains the \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^8\n). The\nthird line contains the \n    m\n integers \n    b_1, b_2,\n    \u2026, b_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^8\n). Output Print a single line containing\nthe final score of the game. Examples Input 2 1 3 2 2 Output 4 Input 4 5\n235499701 451218171 355604420 132973458 365049318 264083156 491406845 62875547\n175951751 Output 531556171 Note In the first test case, Alice moves the rook\nto \n    (2, 1)\n and Bob moves the rook to \n    (1, 1)\n. This process will\nrepeat for \n    999\n times until finally, after Alice moves the rook, Bob\ncannot move it back to \n    (1, 1)\n because it has been visited \n    1000\n\ntimes before. So the final score of the game is \n    a_2+b_1=4\n. In the second\ntest case, the final score of the game is \n    a_3+b_5\n.\n\n",
