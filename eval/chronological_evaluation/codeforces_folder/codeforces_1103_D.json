There are \n    n\n judges now\nin the layer and you are trying to pass the entrance exam. You have a number\n\n    k\n \u2014 your skill in Cardbluff.

To pass the exam you need\nto convince all judges by playing with them. You can play only one game with\neach judge. As a result of a particular game, you can divide the uncertainty\nof \n    i\n-th judge by any natural divisor of \n    a_i\n which is at most\n\n    k\n. If GCD of all indicators is equal to \n    1\n, you will enter to the\nprofessional layer and become a judge. Also, you want to minimize the total\namount of spent time. So, if you play with \n    x\n judges with total\nexperience \n    y\n you will spend \n    x \n    \u00b7 y\n seconds. Print minimal\ntime to enter to the professional layer or \n    -1\n if it's impossible. Input\nThere are two numbers in the first line \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^6\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^12\n) \u2014 the number of judges and\nyour skill in Cardbluff.
