        "description": "Monocarp had a sequence \n    a\n consisting of \n    n + m\n integers \n    a_1,\n    a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n + m\n. He painted the elements into two colors, red and\nblue; \n    n\n elements were painted red, all other \n    m\n elements were\npainted blue. After painting the elements, he has written two sequences\n\n    r_1, r_2, \n    \u2026, r_n\n and \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026, b_m\n. The sequence\n\n    r\n consisted of all red elements of \n    a\n in the order they appeared in\n\n    a\n; similarly, the sequence \n    b\n consisted of all blue elements of\n\n    a\n in the order they appeared in \n    a\n as well. Unfortunately, the\noriginal sequence was lost, and Monocarp only has the sequences \n    r\n and\n\n    b\n. He wants to restore the original sequence. In case there are multiple\nways to restore it, he wants to choose a way to restore that maximizes the\nvalue of \n    \n\n    f(a) = \n    max(0, a_1, (a_1 + a_2), (a_1 + a_2 + a_3), \n    \u2026,\n    (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \n    \u2026 + a_n + m))\n\n    \n Help Monocarp to calculate the\nmaximum possible value of \n    f(a)\n. Input The first line contains one\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then\nthe test cases follow. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line\nof each test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n).\nThe second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    r_1, r_2, \n    \u2026, r_n\n\n(\n    -100 \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 100\n). The third line contains one integer \n    m\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 100\n). The fourth line contains \n    m\n integers \n    b_1,\n    b_2, \n    \u2026, b_m\n (\n    -100 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 100\n). Output For each test\ncase, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible value of \n    f(a)\n. Example\nInput 4 4 6 -5 7 -3 3 2 3 -4 2 1 1 4 10 -3 2 2 5 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 5 -1 -2 -3 -4\n-5 1 0 1 0 Output 13 13 0 0 Note In the explanations for the sample test\ncases, red elements are marked as bold. In the first test case, one of the\npossible sequences \n    a\n is \n    [\n    6, 2, \n    -5, 3,\n    \n    7, \n    -3, -4]\n. In the second test case, one of the\npossible sequences \n    a\n is \n    [10, \n    1, -3, \n    1, 2,\n    2]\n. In the third test case, one of the possible sequences \n    a\n is\n\n    [\n    -1, -1, -2, -3, \n    -2, -4, -5, \n    -3,\n    \n    -4, \n    -5]\n. In the fourth test case, one of the possible\nsequences \n    a\n is \n    [0, \n    0]\n.\n\n",
