        "description": "Zombies have found out about the Zombie Contamination level checker and\nmanaged to damage it! Now detecting the shape of their main compound will be a\nreal challenge for Heidi. As before, a lair can be represented as a strictly\nconvex polygon on a lattice. Each vertex of the polygon occupies a point on\nthe lattice. However, the damaged Zombie Contamination level checker can only\ntell, for each cell, whether the level of Zombie Contamination for that cell\nis in the set 1, 2, 3. In other words, Heidi knows all the cells of the\nlattice for which the Contamination level is not 0 and not 4. Given this\ninformation, Heidi still wants to know the exact shape of the lair to rain\ndestruction on the zombies. Help her! Input The input contains multiple test\ncases. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers\nN and M, where N is the size of the lattice grid (5 \u2264 N \u2264 100000) and M is the\nnumber of lattice points for which the Zombie Contamination level is 1, 2, or\n3 (8 \u2264 M \u2264 200000). The second line of each test case contains M pairs of\nintegers x1, y1, ..., xM, yM \u2013 coordinates of the cells with Zombie\nContamination level not equal to 0 nor 4. It is guaranteed that 1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264\nN. All pairs xi, yi are different. Cells are enumerated based on the\ncoordinates of their upper right corner. This means that the bottommost\nleftmost cell that touches the origin has coordinates (1, 1), and the\nuppermost leftmost cell is identified as (1, N). The last line of the file\ncontains two zeroes. This line should not be treated as a test case. The sum\nof the M values for all tests in one file will not exceed 200000. Output For\neach test case, the following output is expected: The first line of the output\nshould contain one integer V, the number of vertices of the polygon that is\nthe secret lair. The next V lines each should contain two integers, denoting\nthe vertices of the polygon in the clockwise order, starting from the\nlexicographically smallest vertex. Example Input 8 19 2 3 2 4 2 5 3 3 3 5 4 3\n4 5 4 6 5 2 5 3 5 6 6 2 6 3 6 4 6 5 6 6 6 7 7 6 7 7 5 8 2 2 2 3 2 4 3 2 3 4 4\n2 4 3 4 4 0 0 Output 4 2 3 2 4 6 6 5 2 4 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 2 Note It is guaranteed\nthat the solution always exists and is unique. It is guaranteed that in the\ncorrect solution the coordinates of the polygon vertices are between 1 and N -\n1. A vertex (x1, y1) is lexicographically smaller than vertex (x2, y2) if x1 <\nx2 or .\n\n",
