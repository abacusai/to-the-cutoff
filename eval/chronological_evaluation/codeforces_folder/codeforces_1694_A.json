        "description": "Define the score of some binary string \n    T\n as the absolute difference\nbetween the number of zeroes and ones in it. (for example, \n    T=\n 010001\ncontains \n    4\n zeroes and \n    2\n ones, so the score of \n    T\n is \n    |4-2|\n    = 2\n). Define the creepiness of some binary string \n    S\n as the maximum\nscore among all of its prefixes (for example, the creepiness of \n    S=\n 01001\nis equal to \n    2\n because the score of the prefix \n    S[1 \n    \u2026 4]\n is\n\n    2\n and the rest of the prefixes have a score of \n    2\n or less). Given\ntwo integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n, construct a binary string consisting of\n\n    a\n zeroes and \n    b\n ones with the minimum possible creepiness. Input\nThe first line contains a single integer \n    t\n \n    (1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 1000)\n \u2014\nthe number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. The only\nline of each test case contains two integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    a, b \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the numbers of zeroes and ones correspondingly. Output\nFor each test case, print a binary string consisting of \n    a\n zeroes and\n\n    b\n ones with the minimum possible creepiness. If there are multiple\nanswers, print any of them. Example Input 5 1 1 1 2 5 2 4 5 3 7 Output 10 011\n0011000 101010101 0001111111 Note In the first test case, the score of \n    S[1\n    \n    \u2026 1]\n is \n    1\n, and the score of \n    S[1 \n    \u2026 2]\n is \n    0\n.\nIn the second test case, the minimum possible creepiness is \n    1\n and one of\nthe other answers is 101. In the third test case, the minimum possible\ncreepiness is \n    3\n and one of the other answers is 0001100.\n\n",
