        "description": "The Smart Beaver from ABBYY came up with another splendid problem for the\nABBYY Cup participants! This time the Beaver invites the contest participants\nto check out a problem on sorting documents by their subjects. Let's describe\nthe problem: You've got some training set of documents. For each document you\nknow its subject. The subject in this problem is an integer from 1 to 3. Each\nof these numbers has a physical meaning. For instance, all documents with\nsubject 3 are about trade. You can download the training set of documents at\nthe following link:\nhttp://download4.abbyy.com/a2/X2RZ2ZWXBG5VYWAL61H76ZQM/train.zip. The archive\ncontains three directories with names \"1\", \"2\", \"3\". Directory named \"1\"\ncontains documents on the 1-st subject, directory \"2\" contains documents on\nthe 2-nd subject, and directory \"3\" contains documents on the 3-rd subject.\nEach document corresponds to exactly one file from some directory. All\ndocuments have the following format: the first line contains the document\nidentifier, the second line contains the name of the document, all subsequent\nlines contain the text of the document. The document identifier is used to\nmake installing the problem more convenient and has no useful information for\nthe participants. You need to write a program that should indicate the subject\nfor a given document. It is guaranteed that all documents given as input to\nyour program correspond to one of the three subjects of the training set.\nInput The first line contains integer id (0 \u2264 id \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the document\nidentifier. The second line contains the name of the document. The third and\nthe subsequent lines contain the text of the document. It is guaranteed that\nthe size of any given document will not exceed 10 kilobytes. The tests for\nthis problem are divided into 10 groups. Documents of groups 1 and 2 are taken\nfrom the training set, but their identifiers will not match the identifiers\nspecified in the training set. Groups from the 3-rd to the 10-th are roughly\nsorted by the author in ascending order of difficulty (these groups contain\ndocuments which aren't present in the training set). Output Print an integer\nfrom 1 to 3, inclusive \u2014 the number of the subject the given document\ncorresponds to. Examples\n\n",
