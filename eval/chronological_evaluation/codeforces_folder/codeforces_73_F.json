        "description": "Vasya plays the Plane of Tanks. The tanks in this game keep trying to finish\neach other off. But your \"Pedalny\" is not like that... He just needs to drive\nin a straight line from point A to point B on the plane. Unfortunately, on the\nsame plane are n enemy tanks. We shall regard all the tanks as points. At the\ninitial moment of time Pedalny is at the point A. Enemy tanks would be happy\nto destroy it immediately, but initially their turrets are tuned in other\ndirections. Specifically, for each tank we know the initial rotation of the\nturret ai (the angle in radians relative to the OX axis in the\ncounterclockwise direction) and the maximum speed of rotation of the turret wi\n(radians per second). If at any point of time a tank turret will be aimed\nprecisely at the tank Pedalny, then the enemy fires and it never misses.\nPedalny can endure no more than k shots. Gun reloading takes very much time,\nso we can assume that every enemy will produce no more than one shot. Your\ntask is to determine what minimum speed of v Pedalny must have to get to the\npoint B. It is believed that Pedalny is able to instantly develop the speed of\nv, and the first k shots at him do not reduce the speed and do not change the\ncoordinates of the tank. Input The first line contains 4 numbers \u2013 the\ncoordinates of points A and B (in meters), the points do not coincide. On the\nsecond line number n is given (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^4). It is the number of enemy tanks.\nEach of the following n lines contain the coordinates of a corresponding tank\nxi, yi and its parameters ai and wi (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 2\u03c0, 0 \u2264 wi \u2264 100). Numbers ai\nand wi contain at most 5 digits after the decimal point. All coordinates are\nintegers and their absolute values do not exceed 10^5. Enemy tanks can rotate\na turret in the clockwise as well as in the counterclockwise direction at the\nangular speed of not more than wi. It is guaranteed that each of the enemy\ntanks will need at least 0.1 seconds to aim at any point of the segment AB and\neach of the enemy tanks is posistioned no closer than 0.1 meters to line AB.\nOn the last line is given the number k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n). Output Print a single\nnumber with absolute or relative error no more than 10^-4 \u2014 the minimum\nrequired speed of Pedalny in meters per second.
