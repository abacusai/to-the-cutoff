        "description": "You are given two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n. You want to choose two\nstrictly positive (greater than zero) integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n, and then\napply the following operation to \n    x\n exactly \n    a\n times: replace\n\n    x\n with \n    b \n    \u00b7 x\n. You want to find two positive integers \n    a\n\nand \n    b\n such that \n    x\n becomes equal to \n    y\n after this process. If\nthere are multiple possible pairs, you can choose any of them. If there is no\nsuch pair, report it. For example: if \n    x = 3\n and \n    y = 75\n, you may\nchoose \n    a = 2\n and \n    b = 5\n, so that \n    x\n becomes equal to \n    3\n    \n    \u00b7 5 \n    \u00b7 5 = 75\n; if \n    x = 100\n and \n    y = 100\n, you may\nchoose \n    a = 3\n and \n    b = 1\n, so that \n    x\n becomes equal to \n    100\n    \n    \u00b7 1 \n    \u00b7 1 \n    \u00b7 1 = 100\n; if \n    x = 42\n and \n    y = 13\n,\nthere is no answer since you cannot decrease \n    x\n with the given\noperations. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line\ncontaining two integers \n    x\n and \n    y\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x, y \n    \u2264 100\n).\nOutput If it is possible to choose a pair of positive integers \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n so that \n    x\n becomes \n    y\n after the aforementioned process,\nprint these two integers. The integers you print should be not less than\n\n    1\n and not greater than \n    10^9\n (it can be shown that if the answer\nexists, there is a pair of integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n meeting these\nconstraints). If there are multiple such pairs, print any of them. If it is\nimpossible to choose a pair of integers \n    a\n and \n    b\n so that \n    x\n\nbecomes \n    y\n, print the integer \n    0\n twice.
