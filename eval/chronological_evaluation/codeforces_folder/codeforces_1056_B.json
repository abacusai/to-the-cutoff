        "description": "Arkady and his friends love playing checkers on an \n    n \n    \u00d7 n\n field.\nThe rows and the columns of the field are enumerated from \n    1\n to \n    n\n.\nThe friends have recently won a championship, so Arkady wants to please them\nwith some candies. Remembering an old parable (but not its moral), Arkady\nwants to give to his friends one set of candies per each cell of the field:\nthe set of candies for cell \n    (i, j)\n will have exactly \n    (i^2 + j^2)\n\ncandies of unique type. There are \n    m\n friends who deserve the present. How\nmany of these \n    n \n    \u00d7 n\n sets of candies can be split equally into\n\n    m\n parts without cutting a candy into pieces? Note that each set has to\nbe split independently since the types of candies in different sets are\ndifferent. Input The only line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the size of the field and\nthe number of parts to split the sets into. Output Print a single integer \u2014\nthe number of sets that can be split equally. Examples Input 3 3 Output 1\nInput 6 5 Output 13 Input 1000000000 1 Output 1000000000000000000 Note In the\nfirst example, only the set for cell \n    (3, 3)\n can be split equally (\n    3^2\n    + 3^2 = 18\n, which is divisible by \n    m=3\n). In the second example, the\nsets for the following cells can be divided equally: \n    (1, 2)\n and \n    (2,\n    1)\n, since \n    1^2 + 2^2 = 5\n, which is divisible by \n    5\n; \n    (1, 3)\n\nand \n    (3, 1)\n; \n    (2, 4)\n and \n    (4, 2)\n; \n    (2, 6)\n and \n    (6,\n    2)\n; \n    (3, 4)\n and \n    (4, 3)\n; \n    (3, 6)\n and \n    (6, 3)\n; \n    (5,\n    5)\n. In the third example, sets in all cells can be divided equally, since\n\n    m = 1\n.\n\n",
