        "description": "An elephant decided to visit his friend. It turned out that the elephant's\nhouse is located at point 0 and his friend's house is located at point x(x >\n0) of the coordinate line. In one step the elephant can move 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5\npositions forward. Determine, what is the minimum number of steps he need to\nmake in order to get to his friend's house. Input The first line of the input\ncontains an integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 1 000 000) \u2014 The coordinate of the friend's\nhouse. Output Print the minimum number of steps that elephant needs to make to\nget from point 0 to point x. Examples Input 5 Output 1 Input 12 Output 3 Note\nIn the first sample the elephant needs to make one step of length 5 to reach\nthe point x. In the second sample the elephant can get to point x if he moves\nby 3, 5 and 4. There are other ways to get the optimal answer but the elephant\ncannot reach x in less than three moves.\n\n",
