        "description": "Little W and Little P decided to send letters to each other regarding the most\nimportant events during a day. There are \n    n\n events during a day: at time\nmoment \n    t_i\n something happens to the person \n    p_i\n (\n    p_i\n is\neither W or P, denoting Little W and Little P, respectively), so he needs to\nimmediately send a letter to the other person. They can send a letter using\none of the two ways: Ask Friendly O to deliver the letter directly. Friendly O\ntakes \n    d\n acorns for each letter. Leave the letter at Wise R's den. Wise R\nvalues free space, so he takes \n    c \n    \u00b7 T\n acorns for storing a letter\nfor a time segment of length \n    T\n. The recipient can take a letter from\nWise R either when he leaves his own letter at Wise R's den, or at time moment\n\n    t_n + 1\n, when everybody comes to Wise R for a tea. It is not possible\nto take a letter from Wise R's den at other time moments. The friends can\nstore as many letters at Wise R's den as they want, paying for each one\nseparately. Help the friends determine the minimum possible total cost of\nsending all letters. Input The first line contains three integers \n    n, c,\n    d\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 c \n    \u2264 10^2\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    d \n    \u2264 10^8\n) \u2014 the number of letters, the cost of storing a letter for\none time unit at Wise R's den and the cost of delivering a letter via Friendly\nO. The next \n    n\n describe the events. The \n    i\n-th of them contains an\ninteger \n    t_i\n and a character \n    p_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 t_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n,\n\n    p_i\n is either W or P) \u2014 the time the \n    i\n-th event happens and the\nperson the event happens to. The last line contains a single integer \n    t_n +\n    1\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 t_n+1\n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the time when everybody comes to\nWise R for a tea and takes all remaining letters. It is guaranteed that \n    t_i\n    < t_i + 1\n for all \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Output Print a single\ninteger \u2014 the minimum possible cost of delivery of all letters. Examples Input\n5 1 4 0 P 1 W 3 P 5 P 8 P 10 Output 16 Input 10 10 94 17 W 20 W 28 W 48 W 51 P\n52 W 56 W 62 P 75 P 78 P 87 Output 916 Note One of optimal solutions in the\nfirst example: At time moment 0 Little P leaves the letter at Wise R's den. At\ntime moment 1 Little W leaves his letter at Wise R's den and takes Little P's\nletter. This letter is at the den from time moment 0 to time moment 1, it\ncosts \n    1\n acorn. At time moment 3 Little P sends his letter via Friendly\nO, it costs \n    4\n acorns. At time moment 5 Little P leaves his letter at the\nden, receiving Little W's letter which storage costs 4 acorns. At time moment\n8 Little P leaves one more letter at the den. At time moment 10 Little W comes\nto the den for a tea and receives the two letters, paying 5 and 2 acorns.The\ntotal cost of delivery is thus \n    1 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16\n acorns.\n\n",
