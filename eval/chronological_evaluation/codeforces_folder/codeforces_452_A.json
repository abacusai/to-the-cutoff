        "description": "You are solving the crossword problem K from IPSC 2014. You solved all the\nclues except for one: who does Eevee evolve into? You are not very into\npokemons, but quick googling helped you find out, that Eevee can evolve into\neight different pokemons: Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon,\nLeafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon. You know the length of the word in the\ncrossword, and you already know some letters. Designers of the crossword made\nsure that the answer is unambiguous, so you can assume that exactly one\npokemon out of the 8 that Eevee evolves into fits the length and the letters\ngiven. Your task is to find it. Input First line contains an integer n (6 \u2264 n\n\u2264 8) \u2013 the length of the string. Next line contains a string consisting of n\ncharacters, each of which is either a lower case english letter (indicating a\nknown letter) or a dot character (indicating an empty cell in the crossword).\nOutput Print a name of the pokemon that Eevee can evolve into that matches the\npattern in the input. Use lower case letters only to print the name (in\nparticular, do not capitalize the first letter). Examples Input 7 j......\nOutput jolteon Input 7 ...feon Output leafeon Input 7 .l.r.o. Output flareon\nNote Here's a set of names in a form you can paste into your solution:\n[\"vaporeon\", \"jolteon\", \"flareon\", \"espeon\", \"umbreon\", \"leafeon\", \"glaceon\",\n\"sylveon\"] \"vaporeon\", \"jolteon\", \"flareon\", \"espeon\", \"umbreon\", \"leafeon\",\n\"glaceon\", \"sylveon\"\n\n",
