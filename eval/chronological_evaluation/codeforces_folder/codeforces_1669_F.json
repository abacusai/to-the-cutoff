        "description": "There are \n    n\n candies put from left to right on a table. The candies are\nnumbered from left to right. The \n    i\n-th candy has weight \n    w_i\n. Alice\nand Bob eat candies. Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she\ncan't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies\nfrom the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row). Of course, if\nAlice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa). They want to be fair.\nTheir goal is to eat the same total weight of candies. What is the most number\nof candies they can eat in total? Input The first line contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first\nline of each test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n) \u2014 the number of candies on the table. The second line of each\ntest case contains \n    n\n integers \n    w_1, w_2, \n    \u2026, w_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    w_i \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the weights of candies from left to right. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the\nmaximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total while satisfying the\ncondition. Example Input 4 3 10 20 10 6 2 1 4 2 4 1 5 1 2 4 8 16 9 7 3 20 5 15\n1 11 8 10 Output 2 6 0 7 Note For the first test case, Alice will eat one\ncandy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no\nbetter way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is\n\n    2\n because they eat two candies in total. For the second test case, Alice\nwill eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight \n    7\n) and\nBob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight\n\n    7\n). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten,\nso the answer is \n    6\n (because they eat six candies in total). For the\nthird test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero\nweight so the answer is \n    0\n. For the fourth test case, Alice will eat\ncandies with weights \n    [7, 3, 20]\n and Bob will eat candies with weights\n\n    [10, 8, 11, 1]\n, they each eat \n    30\n weight. There is no better\npartition so the answer is \n    7\n.\n\n",
