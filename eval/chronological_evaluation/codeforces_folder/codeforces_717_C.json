        "description": "Harry Water, Ronaldo, Her-my-oh-knee and their friends have started a new\nschool year at their MDCS School of Speechcraft and Misery. At the time, they\nare very happy to have seen each other after a long time. The sun is shining,\nbirds are singing, flowers are blooming, and their Potions class teacher,\nprofessor Snipe is sulky as usual. Due to his angst fueled by disappointment\nin his own life, he has given them a lot of homework in Potions class. Each of\nthe n students has been assigned a single task. Some students do certain tasks\nfaster than others. Thus, they want to redistribute the tasks so that each\nstudent still does exactly one task, and that all tasks are finished. Each\nstudent has their own laziness level, and each task has its own difficulty\nlevel. Professor Snipe is trying hard to improve their work ethics, so each\nstudent\u2019s laziness level is equal to their task\u2019s difficulty level. Both sets\nof values are given by the sequence a, where ai represents both the laziness\nlevel of the i-th student and the difficulty of his task. The time a student\nneeds to finish a task is equal to the product of their laziness level and the\ntask\u2019s difficulty. They are wondering, what is the minimum possible total time\nthey must spend to finish all tasks if they distribute them in the optimal\nway. Each person should receive one task and each task should be given to one\nperson. Print the answer modulo 10 007. Input The first line of input contains\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of tasks. The next n lines contain\nexactly one integer number ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 100 000) \u2014 both the difficulty of the\ninitial task and the laziness of the i-th students. Output Print the minimum\ntotal time to finish all tasks modulo 10 007. Example Input 2 1 3 Output 6\nNote In the first sample, if the students switch their tasks, they will be\nable to finish them in 3 + 3 = 6 time units.\n\n",
