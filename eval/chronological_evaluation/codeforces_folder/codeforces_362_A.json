        "name": "Two Semiknights Meet",
        "description": "A boy Petya loves chess very much. He even came up with a chess piece of his\nown, a semiknight. The semiknight can move in any of these four directions: 2\nsquares forward and 2 squares to the right, 2 squares forward and 2 squares to\nthe left, 2 squares backward and 2 to the right and 2 squares backward and 2\nto the left. Naturally, the semiknight cannot move beyond the limits of the\nchessboard. Petya put two semiknights on a standard chessboard. Petya\nsimultaneously moves with both semiknights. The squares are rather large, so\nafter some move the semiknights can meet, that is, they can end up in the same\nsquare. After the meeting the semiknights can move on, so it is possible that\nthey meet again. Petya wonders if there is such sequence of moves when the\nsemiknights meet. Petya considers some squares bad. That is, they do not suit\nfor the meeting. The semiknights can move through these squares but their\nmeetings in these squares don't count. Petya prepared multiple chess boards.\nHelp Petya find out whether the semiknights can meet on some good square for\neach board. Please see the test case analysis. Input The first line contains\nnumber t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 50) \u2014 the number of boards. Each board is described by a\nmatrix of characters, consisting of 8 rows and 8 columns. The matrix consists\nof characters \".\", \"#\", \"K\", representing an empty good square, a bad square\nand the semiknight's position, correspondingly. It is guaranteed that matrix\ncontains exactly 2 semiknights. The semiknight's squares are considered good\nfor the meeting. The tests are separated by empty line. Output For each test,\nprint on a single line the answer to the problem: \"YES\", if the semiknights\ncan meet and \"NO\" otherwise. Examples Input 2 ........ ........ ......#.\nK..##..# .......# ...##..# ......#. K....... ........ ........ ..#.....\n..#..#.. ..####.. ...##... ........ ....K#K# Output YES NO Note Consider the\nfirst board from the sample. We will assume the rows and columns of the matrix\nto be numbered 1 through 8 from top to bottom and from left to right,\ncorrespondingly. The knights can meet, for example, in square (2, 7). The\nsemiknight from square (4, 1) goes to square (2, 3) and the semiknight goes\nfrom square (8, 1) to square (6, 3). Then both semiknights go to (4, 5) but\nthis square is bad, so they move together to square (2, 7). On the second\nboard the semiknights will never meet.\n\n",
