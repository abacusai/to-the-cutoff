        "description": "Pashmak decided to give Parmida a pair of flowers from the garden. There are n\nflowers in the garden and the i-th of them has a beauty number bi. Parmida is\na very strange girl so she doesn't want to have the two most beautiful flowers\nnecessarily. She wants to have those pairs of flowers that their beauty\ndifference is maximal possible! Your task is to write a program which\ncalculates two things: The maximum beauty difference of flowers that Pashmak\ncan give to Parmida. The number of ways that Pashmak can pick the flowers. Two\nways are considered different if and only if there is at least one flower that\nis chosen in the first way and not chosen in the second way. Input The first\nline of the input contains n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^5). In the next line there are n\nspace-separated integers b1, b2, ..., bn (1 \u2264 bi \u2264 10^9). Output The only line\nof output should contain two integers. The maximum beauty difference and the\nnumber of ways this may happen, respectively. Examples Input 2 1 2 Output 1 1\nInput 3 1 4 5 Output 4 1 Input 5 3 1 2 3 1 Output 2 4 Note In the third sample\nthe maximum beauty difference is 2 and there are 4 ways to do this: choosing\nthe first and the second flowers; choosing the first and the fifth flowers;\nchoosing the fourth and the second flowers; choosing the fourth and the fifth\nflowers.\n\n",
