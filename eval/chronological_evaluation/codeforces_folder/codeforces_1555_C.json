        "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game on a matrix, consisting of \n    2\n rows and\n\n    m\n columns. The cell in the \n    i\n-th row in the \n    j\n-th column\ncontains \n    a_i, j\n coins in it. Initially, both Alice and Bob are\nstanding in a cell \n    (1, 1)\n. They are going to perform a sequence of moves\nto reach a cell \n    (2, m)\n. The possible moves are: Move right \u2014 from some\ncell \n    (x, y)\n to \n    (x, y + 1)\n; Move down \u2014 from some cell \n    (x, y)\n\nto \n    (x + 1, y)\n. First, Alice makes all her moves until she reaches \n    (2,\n    m)\n. She collects the coins in all cells she visit (including the starting\ncell). When Alice finishes, Bob starts his journey. He also performs the moves\nto reach \n    (2, m)\n and collects the coins in all cells that he visited, but\nAlice didn't. The score of the game is the total number of coins Bob collects.\nAlice wants to minimize the score. Bob wants to maximize the score. What will\nthe score of the game be if both players play optimally? Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ntestcases. Then the descriptions of \n    t\n testcases follow. The first line\nof the testcase contains a single integer \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^5\n)\n\u2014 the number of columns of the matrix. The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    2\n\nlines contain \n    m\n integers \n    a_i,1, a_i,2, \n    \u2026, a_i,m\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i,j\n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of coins in the cell in the\n\n    i\n-th row in the \n    j\n-th column of the matrix. The sum of \n    m\n over\nall testcases doesn't exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each testcase print a\nsingle integer \u2014 the score of the game if both players play optimally. Example\nInput 3 3 1 3 7 3 5 1 3 1 3 9 3 5 1 1 4 7 Output 7 8 0 Note The paths for the\ntestcases are shown on the following pictures. Alice's path is depicted in red\nand Bob's path is depicted in blue.\n\n",
