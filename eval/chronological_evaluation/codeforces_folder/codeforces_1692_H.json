        "description": "Marian is at a casino. The game at the casino works like this. Before each\nround, the player selects a number between \n    1\n and \n    10^9\n. After that,\na dice with \n    10^9\n faces is rolled so that a random number between \n    1\n\nand \n    10^9\n appears. If the player guesses the number correctly their total\nmoney is doubled, else their total money is halved. Marian predicted the\nfuture and knows all the numbers \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n\n that the dice\nwill show in the next \n    n\n rounds. He will pick three integers \n    a\n,\n\n    l\n and \n    r\n (\n    l \n    \u2264 r\n). He will play \n    r-l+1\n rounds\n(rounds between \n    l\n and \n    r\n inclusive). In each of these rounds, he\nwill guess the same number \n    a\n. At the start (before the round \n    l\n) he\nhas \n    1\n dollar. Marian asks you to determine the integers \n    a\n, \n    l\n\nand \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n)\nsuch that he makes the most money at the end. Note that during halving and\nmultiplying there is no rounding and there are no precision errors. So, for\nexample during a game, Marian could have money equal to\n\n    11024\n, \n    1128\n, \n    12\n,\n\n    1\n, \n    2\n, \n    4\n, etc. (any value of \n    2^t\n, where \n    t\n is an\ninteger of any sign). Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of\neach test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of rounds. The second line of each test case\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    x_1, x_2, \n    \u2026, x_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n), where \n    x_i\n is the number that will fall on the dice in the\n\n    i\n-th round. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For each test case, output three\nintegers \n    a\n, \n    l\n, and \n    r\n such that Marian makes the most amount\nof money gambling with his strategy. If there are multiple answers, you may\noutput any of them. Example Input 4 5 4 4 3 4 4 5 11 1 11 1 11 1 1000000000 10\n8 8 8 9 9 6 6 9 6 6 Output 4 1 5 1 2 2 1000000000 1 1 6 6 10 Note For the\nfirst test case, the best choice is \n    a=4\n, \n    l=1\n, \n    r=5\n, and the\ngame would go as follows. Marian starts with one dollar. After the first\nround, he ends up with \n    2\n dollars because the numbers coincide with the\nchosen one. After the second round, he ends up with \n    4\n dollars because\nthe numbers coincide again. After the third round, he ends up with \n    2\n\ndollars because he guesses \n    4\n even though \n    3\n is the correct choice.\nAfter the fourth round, he ends up with \n    4\n dollars again. In the final\nround, he ends up \n    8\n dollars because he again guessed correctly. There\nare many possible answers for the second test case, but it can be proven that\nMarian will not end up with more than \n    2\n dollars, so any choice with \n    l\n    = r\n with the appropriate \n    a\n is acceptable.\n\n",
