        "description": "Bob has put on some weight recently. In order to lose weight a bit, Bob has\ndecided to swim regularly in the pool. However, the day before he went to the\npool for the first time he had a weird dream. In this dream Bob was swimming\nalong one of the pool's lanes, but also there were some jellyfish swimming\naround him. It's worth mentioning that jellyfish have always been one of Bob's\ndeepest childhood fears. Let us assume the following physical model for Bob's\ndream. The pool's lane is an area of the plane between lines \n    x=0\n and\n\n    x=w\n. Bob is not allowed to swim outside of the lane, but he may touch\nits bounding lines if he wants. The jellyfish are very small, but in Bob's\ndream they are extremely swift. Each jellyfish has its area of activity around\nit. Those areas are circles of various radii, with the jellyfish sitting in\ntheir centers. The areas of activity of two jellyfish may overlap and one area\nof activity may even be fully contained within another one. Bob has a shape of\na convex polygon. Unfortunately, Bob's excess weight has made him very clumsy,\nand as a result he can't rotate his body while swimming. So he swims in a\nparallel translation pattern. However at any given moment of time he can\nchoose any direction of his movement. Whenever Bob swims into a jellyfish's\nactivity area, it will immediately notice him and sting him very painfully. We\nassume that Bob has swum into the activity area if at some moment of time the\nintersection of his body with the jellyfish's activity area had a positive\narea (for example, if they only touch, the jellyfish does not notice Bob).\nOnce a jellyfish stung Bob, it happily swims away and no longer poses any\nthreat to Bob. Bob wants to swim the lane to its end and get stung the least\npossible number of times. He will start swimming on the line \n    y=-h\n, and\nfinish on the line \n    y=h\n where \n    h = 10^10\n. Input The first line\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    w\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 200, 1 \n    \u2264 w\n    \n    \u2264 30000\n) \u2014 the number of vertices in the polygon that constitutes the\nBob's shape and the width of the swimming pool lane. Each of the next \n    n\n\nlines contains two integers \n    x_i\n and \n    y_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 w, 0\n    \n    \u2264 y_i \n    \u2264 30000\n) \u2014 the coordinates of corresponding vertex of the\npolygon. The vertices in the polygon are given in counterclockwise order. It\nis guaranteed that the given polygon is strictly convex. The next line\ncontains an only integer \n    m\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the number of\nthe jellyfish in the pool. Each of the next \n    m\n lines contains three\nintegers (\n    x_i\n, \n    y_i\n, \n    r_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x_i \n    \u2264 w, 0 \n    \u2264 y_i\n    \n    \u2264 30000, 1 \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 30000\n) \u2014 coordinates of the \n    i\n-th\njellyfish in the pool and the radius of her activity. It is guaranteed, that\nno two jellyfish are located in the same point. Output Output a single integer\n\u2014 the least possible number of jellyfish that will sting Bob.
