        "description": "Daniel is watching a football team playing a game during their training\nsession. They want to improve their passing skills during that session. The\ngame involves \n    n\n players, making multiple passes towards each other.\nUnfortunately, since the balls were moving too fast, after the session Daniel\nis unable to know how many balls were involved during the game. The only thing\nhe knows is the number of passes delivered by each player during all the\nsession. Find the minimum possible amount of balls that were involved in the\ngame. Input There are several test cases in the input data. The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^4\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. This is followed by the test cases description. The\nfirst line of each test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of players. The second line of the test case\ncontains a sequence of integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n), where \n    a_i\n is the number of passes delivered by the\n\n    i\n-th player. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test\ncases doesn't exceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case print a single\ninteger \u2014 the answer to the problem. Example Input 4 4 2 3 3 2 3 1 5 2 2 0 0 4\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 Output 1 2 0 1 Note In the first\ntest case, with the only ball, the game can go like this: \n    2 \n    \u2192 1\n    \n    \u2192 3 \n    \u2192 4 \n    \u2192 1 \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192\n    3 \n    \u2192 4 \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 3 \n    \u2192 2\n. In the\nsecond test case, there is no possible way to play the game with only one\nball. One possible way to play with two balls: \n    2 \n    \u2192 1\n    \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 3 \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 1\n. \n    2\n    \n    \u2192 3 \n    \u2192 2 \n    \u2192 1\n In the third example, there\nwere no passes, so \n    0\n balls are possible.\n\n",
