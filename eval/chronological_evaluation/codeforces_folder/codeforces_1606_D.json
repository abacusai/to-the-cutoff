        "description": "You are given a matrix, consisting of \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n columns. The\n\n    j\n-th cell of the \n    i\n-th row contains an integer \n    a_ij\n. First,\nyou have to color each row of the matrix either red or blue in such a way that\nat least one row is colored red and at least one row is colored blue. Then,\nyou have to choose an integer \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k < m\n) and cut the\ncolored matrix in such a way that the first \n    k\n columns become a separate\nmatrix (the left matrix) and the last \n    m-k\n columns become a separate\nmatrix (the right matrix). The coloring and the cut are called perfect if two\nproperties hold: every red cell in the left matrix contains an integer greater\nthan every blue cell in the left matrix; every blue cell in the right matrix\ncontains an integer greater than every red cell in the right matrix. Find any\nperfect coloring and cut, or report that there are none. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of\ntestcases. Then the descriptions of \n    t\n testcases follow. The first line\nof each testcase contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n, m\n    \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; \n    n \n    \u00b7 m \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the number of rows\nand the number of columns in the matrix, respectively. The \n    i\n-th of the\nnext \n    n\n lines contains \n    m\n integers \n    a_i1, a_i2, \n    \u2026,\n    a_im\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_ij\n    \u2264 10^6\n). The sum of \n    n \n    \u00b7 m\n over\nall testcases doesn't exceed \n    10^6\n. Output For each testcase print an\nanswer. If there are no perfect colorings and cuts in the matrix, then print\n\"NO\". Otherwise, first, print \"YES\". Then a string, consisting of \n    n\n\ncharacters: the \n    i\n-th character should be 'R' if the \n    i\n-th row is\ncolored red and 'B' if it's colored blue. The string should contain at least\none 'R' and at least one 'B'. Finally, print an integer \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k\n    < m\n) \u2014 the number of columns from the left that are cut.
