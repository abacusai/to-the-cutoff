        "description": "Ryouko is an extremely forgetful girl, she could even forget something that\nhas just happened. So in order to remember, she takes a notebook with her,\ncalled Ryouko's Memory Note. She writes what she sees and what she hears on\nthe notebook, and the notebook became her memory. Though Ryouko is forgetful,\nshe is also born with superb analyzing abilities. However, analyzing depends\ngreatly on gathered information, in other words, memory. So she has to shuffle\nthrough her notebook whenever she needs to analyze, which is tough work.\nRyouko's notebook consists of n pages, numbered from 1 to n. To make life (and\nthis problem) easier, we consider that to turn from page x to page y, |x - y|\npages should be turned. During analyzing, Ryouko needs m pieces of\ninformation, the i-th piece of information is on page ai. Information must be\nread from the notebook in order, so the total number of pages that Ryouko\nneeds to turn is . Ryouko wants to decrease the number of pages that need to\nbe turned. In order to achieve this, she can merge two pages of her notebook.\nIf Ryouko merges page x to page y, she would copy all the information on page\nx to y (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n), and consequently, all elements in sequence a that was x\nwould become y. Note that x can be equal to y, in which case no changes take\nplace. Please tell Ryouko the minimum number of pages that she needs to turn.\nNote she can apply the described operation at most once before the reading.\nNote that the answer can exceed 32-bit integers. Input The first line of input\ncontains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5). The next line contains m\nintegers separated by spaces: a1, a2, ..., am (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 n). Output Print a\nsingle integer \u2014 the minimum number of pages Ryouko needs to turn. Examples\nInput 4 6 1 2 3 4 3 2 Output 3 Input 10 5 9 4 3 8 8 Output 6 Note In the first\nsample, the optimal solution is to merge page 4 to 3, after merging sequence a\nbecomes 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, so the number of pages Ryouko needs to turn is |1\n- 2| + |2 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 2| = 3. In the second sample,\noptimal solution is achieved by merging page 9 to 4.\n\n",
