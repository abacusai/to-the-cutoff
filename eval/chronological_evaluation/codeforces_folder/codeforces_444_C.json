        "description": "DZY loves colors, and he enjoys painting. On a colorful day, DZY gets a\ncolorful ribbon, which consists of n units (they are numbered from 1 to n from\nleft to right). The color of the i-th unit of the ribbon is i at first. It is\ncolorful enough, but we still consider that the colorfulness of each unit is 0\nat first. DZY loves painting, we know. He takes up a paintbrush with color x\nand uses it to draw a line on the ribbon. In such a case some contiguous units\nare painted. Imagine that the color of unit i currently is y. When it is\npainted by this paintbrush, the color of the unit becomes x, and the\ncolorfulness of the unit increases by |x - y|. DZY wants to perform m\noperations, each operation can be one of the following: Paint all the units\nwith numbers between l and r (both inclusive) with color x. Ask the sum of\ncolorfulness of the units between l and r (both inclusive). Can you help DZY?\nInput The first line contains two space-separated integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264\n10^5). Each of the next m lines begins with a integer type (1 \u2264 type \u2264 2),\nwhich represents the type of this operation. If type = 1, there will be 3 more\nintegers l, r, x (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n; 1 \u2264 x \u2264 10^8) in this line, describing an\noperation 1. If type = 2, there will be 2 more integers l, r (1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n)\nin this line, describing an operation 2. Output For each operation 2, print a\nline containing the answer \u2014 sum of colorfulness. Examples Input 3 3 1 1 2 4 1\n2 3 5 2 1 3 Output 8 Input 3 4 1 1 3 4 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 Output 3 2 1 Input 10\n6 1 1 5 3 1 2 7 9 1 10 10 11 1 3 8 12 1 1 10 3 2 1 10 Output 129 Note In the\nfirst sample, the color of each unit is initially [1, 2, 3], and the\ncolorfulness is [0, 0, 0]. After the first operation, colors become [4, 4, 3],\ncolorfulness become [3, 2, 0]. After the second operation, colors become [4,\n5, 5], colorfulness become [3, 3, 2]. So the answer to the only operation of\ntype 2 is 8.\n\n",
