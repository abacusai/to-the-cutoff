        "description": "In the NN country, there are \n    n\n cities, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n,\nand \n    n - 1\n roads, connecting them. There is a roads path between any two\ncities. There are \n    m\n bidirectional bus routes between cities. Buses drive\nbetween two cities taking the shortest path with stops in every city they\ndrive through. Travelling by bus, you can travel from any stop on the route to\nany other. You can travel between cities only by bus. You are interested in\n\n    q\n questions: is it possible to get from one city to another and what is\nthe minimum number of buses you need to use for it? Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of cities. The second line contains \n    n - 1\n integers \n    p_2, p_3,\n    \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i < i\n), where \n    p_i\n means that cities\n\n    p_i\n and \n    i\n are connected by road. The third line contains a single\ninteger \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of bus\nroutes. Each of the next \n    m\n lines contains \n    2\n integers \n    a\n and\n\n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    a \n    \u2260 b\n), meaning that there is\na bus route between cities \n    a\n and \n    b\n. It is possible that there is\nmore than one route between two cities. The next line contains a single\ninteger \n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\nquestions you are interested in. Each of the next \n    q\n lines contains\n\n    2\n integers \n    v\n and \n    u\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 v, u \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    v \n    \u2260\n    u\n), meaning that you are interested if it is possible to get from city\n\n    v\n to city \n    u\n and what is the minimum number of buses you need to\nuse for it. Output Print the answer for each question on a separate line. If\nthere is no way to get from one city to another, print \n    -1\n. Otherwise\nprint the minimum number of buses you have to use.
