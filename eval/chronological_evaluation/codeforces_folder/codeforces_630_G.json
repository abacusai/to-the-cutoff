        "description": "Because of budget cuts one IT company established new non-financial reward\nsystem instead of bonuses. Two kinds of actions are rewarded: fixing critical\nbugs and suggesting new interesting features. A man who fixed a critical bug\ngets \"I fixed a critical bug\" pennant on his table. A man who suggested a new\ninteresting feature gets \"I suggested a new feature\" pennant on his table.\nBecause of the limited budget of the new reward system only 5 \"I fixed a\ncritical bug\" pennants and 3 \"I suggested a new feature\" pennants were bought.\nIn order to use these pennants for a long time they were made challenge ones.\nWhen a man fixes a new critical bug one of the earlier awarded \"I fixed a\ncritical bug\" pennants is passed on to his table. When a man suggests a new\ninteresting feature one of the earlier awarded \"I suggested a new feature\"\npennants is passed on to his table. One man can have several pennants of one\ntype and of course he can have pennants of both types on his table. There are\nn tables in the IT company. Find the number of ways to place the pennants on\nthese tables given that each pennant is situated on one of the tables and each\ntable is big enough to contain any number of pennants. Input The only line of\nthe input contains one integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 500) \u2014 the number of tables in the\nIT company. Output Output one integer \u2014 the amount of ways to place the\npennants on n tables. Examples Input 2 Output 24\n\n",
