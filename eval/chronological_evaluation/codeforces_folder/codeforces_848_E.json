        "name": "Days of Floral Colours",
        "description": "The Floral Clock has been standing by the side of Mirror Lake for years.\nThough unable to keep time, it reminds people of the passage of time and the\ngood old days. On the rim of the Floral Clock are 2n flowers, numbered from 1\nto 2n clockwise, each of which has a colour among all n possible ones. For\neach colour, there are exactly two flowers with it, the distance between which\neither is less than or equal to 2, or equals n. Additionally, if flowers u and\nv are of the same colour, then flowers opposite to u and opposite to v should\nbe of the same colour as well \u2014 symmetry is beautiful! Formally, the distance\nbetween two flowers is 1 plus the number of flowers on the minor arc (or\nsemicircle) between them. Below is a possible arrangement with n = 6 that\ncover all possibilities. The beauty of an arrangement is defined to be the\nproduct of the lengths of flower segments separated by all opposite flowers of\nthe same colour. In other words, in order to compute the beauty, we remove\nfrom the circle all flowers that have the same colour as flowers opposite to\nthem. Then, the beauty is the product of lengths of all remaining segments.\nNote that we include segments of length 0 in this product. If there are no\nflowers that have the same colour as flower opposite to them, the beauty\nequals 0. For instance, the beauty of the above arrangement equals 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 \u00d7\n3 = 9 \u2014 the segments are 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10, 11, 12. While keeping\nthe constraints satisfied, there may be lots of different arrangements. Find\nout the sum of beauty over all possible arrangements, modulo 998 244 353. Two\narrangements are considered different, if a pair (u, v) (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 2n) exists\nsuch that flowers u and v are of the same colour in one of them, but not in\nthe other. Input The first and only line of input contains a lonely positive\ninteger n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 50 000) \u2014 the number of colours present on the Floral\nClock. Output Output one integer \u2014 the sum of beauty over all possible\narrangements of flowers, modulo 998 244 353. Examples Input 3 Output 24 Input\n4 Output 4 Input 7 Output 1316 Input 15 Output 3436404 Note With n = 3, the\nfollowing six arrangements each have a beauty of 2 \u00d7 2 = 4. While many others,\nsuch as the left one in the figure below, have a beauty of 0. The right one is\ninvalid, since it's asymmetric.\n\n",
