        "description": "In winter, the inhabitants of the Moscow Zoo are very bored, in particular, it\nconcerns gorillas. You decided to entertain them and brought a permutation\n\n    p\n of length \n    n\n to the zoo. A permutation of length \n    n\n is an\narray consisting of \n    n\n distinct integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n in any\norder. For example, \n    [2,3,1,5,4]\n is a permutation, but \n    [1,2,2]\n is\nnot a permutation (\n    2\n occurs twice in the array) and \n    [1,3,4]\n is\nalso not a permutation (\n    n=3\n, but \n    4\n is present in the array). The\ngorillas had their own permutation \n    q\n of length \n    n\n. They suggested\nthat you count the number of pairs of integers \n    l, r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264\n    r \n    \u2264 n\n) such that \n    MEX([p_l, p_l+1, \n    \u2026,\n    p_r])=\n    MEX([q_l, q_l+1, \n    \u2026, q_r])\n. The\n\n    MEX\n of the sequence is the minimum integer positive\nnumber missing from this sequence. For example, \n    MEX([1,\n    3]) = 2\n, \n    MEX([5]) = 1\n, \n    MEX([3,\n    1, 2, 6]) = 4\n. You do not want to risk your health, so you will not dare to\nrefuse the gorillas. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the permutations length. The second\nline contains \n    n\n integers \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i\n    \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the elements of the permutation \n    p\n. The third line contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    q_1, q_2, \n    \u2026, q_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 q_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\nthe elements of the permutation \n    q\n. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the\nnumber of suitable pairs \n    l\n and \n    r\n. Examples Input 3 1 3 2 2 1 3\nOutput 2 Input 7 7 3 6 2 1 5 4 6 7 2 5 3 1 4 Output 16 Input 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 5\n4 3 2 1 Output 11 Note In the first example, two segments are correct \u2013 \n    [1,\n    3]\n with \n    MEX\n equal to \n    4\n in both arrays and\n\n    [3, 3]\n with \n    MEX\n equal to \n    1\n in both of\narrays. In the second example, for example, the segment \n    [1, 4]\n is\ncorrect, and the segment \n    [6, 7]\n isn't correct, because\n\n    MEX(5, 4) \n    \u2260\n    MEX(1, 4)\n.\n\n",
