        "description": "All techniques in the ninja world consist of hand seals. At the moment Naruto\nis learning a new technique, which consists of \n    n\n    \u00b7 m\n different\nseals, denoted by distinct numbers. All of them were written in an\n\n    n\n    \u00d7 m\n table. The table is lost now. Naruto managed to remember\nelements of each row from left to right, and elements of each column from top\nto bottom, but he doesn't remember the order of rows and columns. Please\nrestore the table consistent with this data so that Naruto will be able to\nlearn the new technique. Input The first line of the input contains the only\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) denoting the number of test\ncases. Their descriptions follow. The first line of each test case description\nconsists of two space-separated integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m\n    \n    \u2264 500\n) standing for the number of rows and columns in the table,\nrespectively. All hand seals are encoded by the positive integers from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n    \u00b7 m\n. The following \n    n\n lines contain \n    m\n space\nseparated integers each, denoting elements of an arbitrary row in the table\nleft to right. The following \n    m\n lines contain \n    n\n space separated\nintegers each, denoting elements of an arbitrary column in the table top to\nbottom. Sum of \n    nm\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    250\n     000\n.\nIt is guaranteed that each row occurs in the input exactly once, as well as\neach column. It is also guaranteed that each number from \n    1\n to \n    nm\n\noccurs exactly once in all rows, as well as in all columns. Finally, it is\nguaranteed that a table consistent with the input exists. Output For each test\ncase, output \n    n\n lines with \n    m\n space-separated integers each,\ndenoting the restored table. One can show that the answer is always unique.\nExample Input 2 2 3 6 5 4 1 2 3 1 6 2 5 3 4 3 1 2 3 1 3 1 2 Output 1 2 3 6 5 4\n3 1 2 Note Consider the first test case. The matrix is \n    2 \n    \u00d7 3\n. You\nare given the rows and columns in arbitrary order. One of the rows is \n    [6,\n    5, 4]\n. One of the rows is \n    [1, 2, 3]\n. One of the columns is \n    [1,\n    6]\n. One of the columns is \n    [2, 5]\n. One of the columns is \n    [3, 4]\n.\nYou are to reconstruct the matrix. The answer is given in the output.\n\n",
