        "description": "When the river brought Gerda to the house of the Old Lady who Knew Magic, this\nlady decided to make Gerda her daughter. She wants Gerda to forget about Kay,\nso she puts all the roses from the garden underground. Mole, who lives in this\ngarden, now can watch the roses without going up to the surface. Typical mole\nis blind, but this mole was granted as special vision by the Old Lady. He can\nwatch any underground objects on any distance, even through the obstacles and\nother objects. However, the quality of the picture depends on the Manhattan\ndistance to object being observed. Mole wants to find an optimal point to\nwatch roses, that is such point with integer coordinates that the maximum\nManhattan distance to the rose is minimum possible. As usual, he asks you to\nhelp. Manhattan distance between points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is\ndefined as |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| + |z1 - z2|. Input The first line of the\ninput contains an integer t t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThen follow exactly t blocks, each containing the description of exactly one\ntest. The first line of each block contains an integer ni (1 \u2264 ni \u2264 100 000) \u2014\nthe number of roses in the test. Then follow ni lines, containing three\nintegers each \u2014 the coordinates of the corresponding rose. Note that two or\nmore roses may share the same position. It's guaranteed that the sum of all ni\ndoesn't exceed 100 000 and all coordinates are not greater than 10^18 by their\nabsolute value. Output For each of t test cases print three integers \u2014 the\ncoordinates of the optimal point to watch roses. If there are many optimal\nanswers, print any of them. The coordinates of the optimal point may coincide\nwith the coordinates of any rose. Examples Input 1 5 0 0 4 0 0 -4 0 4 0 4 0 0\n1 1 1 Output 0 0 0 Input 2 1 3 5 9 2 3 5 9 3 5 9 Output 3 5 9 3 5 9 Note In\nthe first sample, the maximum Manhattan distance from the point to the rose is\nequal to 4. In the second sample, the maximum possible distance is 0. Note\nthat the positions of the roses may coincide with each other and with the\nposition of the optimal point.\n\n",
