        "description": "Three guys play a game: first, each person writes down \n    n\n distinct words\nof length \n    3\n. Then, they total up the number of points as follows: if a\nword was written by one person \u2014 that person gets 3 points, if a word was\nwritten by two people \u2014 each of the two gets 1 point, if a word was written by\nall \u2014 nobody gets any points. In the end, how many points does each player\nhave? Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains\nan integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of\nwords written by each person. The following three lines each contain \n    n\n\ndistinct strings \u2014 the words written by each person. Each string consists of\n\n    3\n lowercase English characters. Output For each test case, output three\nspace-separated integers \u2014 the number of points each of the three guys earned.\nYou should output the answers in the same order as the input; the \n    i\n-th\ninteger should be the number of points earned by the \n    i\n-th guy. Example\nInput 3 1 abc def abc 3 orz for qaq qaq orz for cod for ces 5 iat roc hem ica\nlly bac ter iol ogi sts bac roc lly iol iat Output 1 3 1 2 2 6 9 11 5 Note In\nthe first test case: The word \n    \n was written by the first\nand third guys \u2014 they each get \n    1\n point. The word \n    \n\nwas written by the second guy only \u2014 he gets \n    3\n points.\n\n",
