        "name": "Vasya and Endless Credits",
        "description": "Vasya wants to buy himself a nice new car. Unfortunately, he lacks some money.\nCurrently he has exactly 0 burles. However, the local bank has \n    n\n credit\noffers. Each offer can be described with three numbers \n    a_i\n, \n    b_i\n\nand \n    k_i\n. Offers are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. If Vasya takes the\n\n    i\n-th offer, then the bank gives him \n    a_i\n burles at the beginning of\nthe month and then Vasya pays bank \n    b_i\n burles at the end of each month\nfor the next \n    k_i\n months (including the month he activated the offer).\nVasya can take the offers any order he wants. Each month Vasya can take no\nmore than one credit offer. Also each credit offer can not be used more than\nonce. Several credits can be active at the same time. It implies that Vasya\npays bank the sum of \n    b_i\n over all the \n    i\n of active credits at the\nend of each month. Vasya wants to buy a car in the middle of some month. He\njust takes all the money he currently has and buys the car of that exact\nprice. Vasya don't really care what he'll have to pay the bank back after he\nbuys a car. He just goes out of the country on his car so that the bank can't\nfind him anymore. What is the maximum price that car can have? Input The first\nline contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 500\n) \u2014 the number of\ncredit offers. Each of the next \n    n\n lines contains three integers\n\n    a_i\n, \n    b_i\n and \n    k_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i, k_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n).\nOutput Print one integer \u2014 the maximum price of the car. Examples Input 4 10 9\n2 20 33 1 30 115 1 5 3 2 Output 32 Input 3 40 1 2 1000 1100 5 300 2 1 Output\n1337 Note In the first example, the following sequence of offers taken is\noptimal: 4 \n    \u2192\n 3. The amount of burles Vasya has changes the\nfollowing way: 5 \n    \u2192\n 32 \n    \u2192\n -86\n\n    \u2192\n .... He takes the money he has in the middle of the second\nmonth (32 burles) and buys the car. The negative amount of money means that\nVasya has to pay the bank that amount of burles. In the second example, the\nfollowing sequence of offers taken is optimal: 3 \n    \u2192\n 1\n\n    \u2192\n 2. The amount of burles Vasya has changes the following\nway: 0 \n    \u2192\n 300 \n    \u2192\n 338 \n    \u2192\n\n1337 \n    \u2192\n 236 \n    \u2192\n -866 \n    \u2192\n ....\n\n",
