        "description": "Diamond Miner is a game that is similar to Gold Miner, but there are \n    n\n\nminers instead of \n    1\n in this game. The mining area can be described as a\nplane. The \n    n\n miners can be regarded as \n    n\n points on the y-axis.\nThere are \n    n\n diamond mines in the mining area. We can regard them as\n\n    n\n points on the x-axis. For some reason, no miners or diamond mines can\nbe at the origin (point \n    (0, 0)\n). Every miner should mine exactly one\ndiamond mine. Every miner has a hook, which can be used to mine a diamond\nmine. If a miner at the point \n    (a,b)\n uses his hook to mine a diamond mine\nat the point \n    (c,d)\n, he will spend \n    \u221a((a-c)^2+(b-d)^2)\n energy\nto mine it (the distance between these points). The miners can't move or help\neach other. The object of this game is to minimize the sum of the energy that\nminers spend. Can you find this minimum? Input The input consists of multiple\ntest cases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264\n    10\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of miners and mines. Each of the next \n    2n\n\nlines contains two space-separated integers \n    x\n (\n    -10^8 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264\n    10^8\n) and \n    y\n (\n    -10^8 \n    \u2264 y \n    \u2264 10^8\n), which represent the\npoint \n    (x,y)\n to describe a miner's or a diamond mine's position. Either\n\n    x = 0\n, meaning there is a miner at the point \n    (0, y)\n, or \n    y =\n    0\n, meaning there is a diamond mine at the point \n    (x, 0)\n. There can be\nmultiple miners or diamond mines at the same point. It is guaranteed that no\npoint is at the origin. It is guaranteed that the number of points on the\nx-axis is equal to \n    n\n and the number of points on the y-axis is equal to\n\n    n\n. It's guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n for all test cases does not\nexceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print a single real number \u2014 the\nminimal sum of energy that should be spent. Your answer is considered correct\nif its absolute or relative error does not exceed \n    10^-9\n. Formally, let\nyour answer be \n    a\n, and the jury's answer be \n    b\n. Your answer is\naccepted if and only if \n    |a - b|/\n    max(1, |b|)\n    \u2264\n    10^-9\n. Example Input 3 2 0 1 1 0 0 -1 -2 0 4 1 0 3 0 -5 0 6 0 0 3 0 1 0 2\n0 4 5 3 0 0 4 0 -3 4 0 2 0 1 0 -3 0 0 -10 0 -2 0 -10 Output 3.650281539872885\n18.061819283610362 32.052255376143336 Note In the first test case, the miners\nare at \n    (0,1)\n and \n    (0,-1)\n, while the diamond mines are at\n\n    (1,0)\n and \n    (-2,0)\n. If you arrange the miners to get the diamond\nmines in the way, shown in the picture, you can get the sum of the energy\n\n    \u221a(2) + \n    \u221a(5)\n.\n\n",
