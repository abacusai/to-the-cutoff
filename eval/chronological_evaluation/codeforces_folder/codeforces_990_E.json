        "description": "Adilbek's house is located on a street which can be represented as the OX\naxis. This street is really dark, so Adilbek wants to install some post lamps\nto illuminate it. Street has \n    n\n positions to install lamps, they\ncorrespond to the integer numbers from \n    0\n to \n    n - 1\n on the OX axis.\nHowever, some positions are blocked and no post lamp can be placed there.\nThere are post lamps of different types which differ only by their power. When\nplaced in position \n    x\n, post lamp of power \n    l\n illuminates the segment\n\n    [x; x + l]\n. The power of each post lamp is always a positive integer\nnumber. The post lamp shop provides an infinite amount of lamps of each type\nfrom power \n    1\n to power \n    k\n. Though each customer is only allowed to\norder post lamps of exactly one type. Post lamps of power \n    l\n cost\n\n    a_l\n each. What is the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly\none type Adilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment \n    [0; n]\n of the\nstreet? If some lamps illuminate any other segment of the street, Adilbek does\nnot care, so, for example, he may place a lamp of power \n    3\n in position\n\n    n - 1\n (even though its illumination zone doesn't completely belong to\nsegment \n    [0; n]\n). Input The first line contains three integer numbers\n\n    n\n, \n    m\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 m\n    \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the length of the segment of the street Adilbek wants to\nilluminate, the number of the blocked positions and the maximum power of the\npost lamp available. The second line contains \n    m\n integer numbers \n    s_1,\n    s_2, \n    \u2026, s_m\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 s_1 < s_2 < \n    \u2026 s_m < n\n) \u2014 the blocked\npositions. The third line contains \n    k\n integer numbers \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the costs of the post lamps.\nOutput Print the minimal total cost of the post lamps of exactly one type\nAdilbek can buy to illuminate the entire segment \n    [0; n]\n of the street.\nIf illumintaing the entire segment \n    [0; n]\n is impossible, print -1.\nExamples Input 6 2 3 1 3 1 2 3 Output 6 Input 4 3 4 1 2 3 1 10 100 1000 Output\n1000 Input 5 1 5 0 3 3 3 3 3 Output -1 Input 7 4 3 2 4 5 6 3 14 15 Output -1\n\n",
