        "description": "Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive\nintegers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7.\nFor example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not. Petya calls\na number almost lucky if it could be evenly divided by some lucky number. Help\nhim find out if the given number n is almost lucky. Input The single line\ncontains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number that needs to be checked.\nOutput In the only line print \"YES\" (without the quotes), if number n is\nalmost lucky. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without the quotes). Examples Input 47\nOutput YES Input 16 Output YES Input 78 Output NO Note Note that all lucky\nnumbers are almost lucky as any number is evenly divisible by itself. In the\nfirst sample 47 is a lucky number. In the second sample 16 is divisible by 4.\n\n",
