        "description": "Makes solves problems on Decoforces and lots of other different online judges.\nEach problem is denoted by its difficulty \u2014 a positive integer number.\nDifficulties are measured the same across all the judges (the problem with\ndifficulty d on Decoforces is as hard as the problem with difficulty d on any\nother judge). Makes has chosen n problems to solve on Decoforces with\ndifficulties a1, a2, ..., an. He can solve these problems in arbitrary order.\nThough he can solve problem i with difficulty ai only if he had already solved\nsome problem with difficulty (no matter on what online judge was it). Before\nstarting this chosen list of problems, Makes has already solved problems with\nmaximum difficulty k. With given conditions it's easy to see that Makes\nsometimes can't solve all the chosen problems, no matter what order he\nchooses. So he wants to solve some problems on other judges to finish solving\nproblems from his list. For every positive integer y there exist some problem\nwith difficulty y on at least one judge besides Decoforces. Makes can solve\nproblems on any judge at any time, it isn't necessary to do problems from the\nchosen list one right after another. Makes doesn't have too much free time, so\nhe asked you to calculate the minimum number of problems he should solve on\nother judges in order to solve all the chosen problems from Decoforces. Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n, k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^3, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^9).\nThe second line contains n space-separated integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1\n\u2264 ai \u2264 10^9). Output Print minimum number of problems Makes should solve on\nother judges in order to solve all chosen problems on Decoforces. Examples\nInput 3 3 2 1 9 Output 1 Input 4 20 10 3 6 3 Output 0 Note In the first\nexample Makes at first solves problems 1 and 2. Then in order to solve the\nproblem with difficulty 9, he should solve problem with difficulty no less\nthan 5. The only available are difficulties 5 and 6 on some other judge.\nSolving any of these will give Makes opportunity to solve problem 3. In the\nsecond example he can solve every problem right from the start.\n\n",
