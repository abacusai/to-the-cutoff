        "description": "The legend of the foundation of Vectorland talks of two integers \n    x\n and\n\n    y\n. Centuries ago, the array king placed two markers at points \n    |x|\n\nand \n    |y|\n on the number line and conquered all the land in between\n(including the endpoints), which he declared to be Arrayland. Many years\nlater, the vector king placed markers at points \n    |x - y|\n and \n    |x +\n    y|\n and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which\nhe declared to be Vectorland. He did so in such a way that the land of\nArrayland was completely inside (including the endpoints) the land of\nVectorland. Here \n    |z|\n denotes the absolute value of \n    z\n. Now, Jose is\nstuck on a question of his history exam: \"What are the values of \n    x\n and\n\n    y\n?\" Jose doesn't know the answer, but he believes he has narrowed the\npossible answers down to \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n. Now,\nhe wants to know the number of unordered pairs formed by two different\nelements from these \n    n\n integers such that the legend could be true if\n\n    x\n and \n    y\n were equal to these two values. Note that it is possible\nthat Jose is wrong, and that no pairs could possibly make the legend true.\nInput The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of choices. The second line contains \n    n\n\npairwise distinct integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    -10^9 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the choices Jose is considering. Output Print a single\ninteger number \u2014 the number of unordered pairs \n    x, y\n formed by\ndifferent numbers from Jose's choices that could make the legend true.\nExamples Input 3 2 5 -3 Output 2 Input 2 3 6 Output 1 Note Consider the first\nsample. For the pair \n    2, 5\n, the situation looks as follows,\nwith the Arrayland markers at \n    |2| = 2\n and \n    |5| = 5\n, while the\nVectorland markers are located at \n    |2 - 5| = 3\n and \n    |2 + 5| = 7\n: The\nlegend is not true in this case, because the interval \n    [2, 3]\n is not\nconquered by Vectorland. For the pair \n    5, -3\n the situation\nlooks as follows, with Arrayland consisting of the interval \n    [3, 5]\n and\nVectorland consisting of the interval \n    [2, 8]\n: As Vectorland completely\ncontains Arrayland, the legend is true. It can also be shown that the legend\nis true for the pair \n    2, -3\n, for a total of two pairs. In the\nsecond sample, the only pair is \n    3, 6\n, and the situation looks\nas follows: Note that even though Arrayland and Vectorland share \n    3\n as\nendpoint, we still consider Arrayland to be completely inside of Vectorland.\n\n",
