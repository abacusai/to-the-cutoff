        "description": "You are given two integers \n    l\n and \n    r\n, \n    l\n    \u2264 r\n. Find the\nlargest possible value of \n    a \n     b\n over all pairs \n    (a, b)\n of\nintegers for which \n    r\n    \u2265 a \n    \u2265 b \n    \u2265 l\n. As a reminder, \n    a \n    \n    b\n is a remainder we get when dividing \n    a\n by \n    b\n. For example,\n\n    26 \n     8 = 2\n. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The\nfirst line contains one positive integer \n    t\n \n    (1\n    \u2264 t\n    \u2264 10^4)\n,\ndenoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The\nonly line of each test case contains two integers \n    l\n, \n    r\n (\n    1\n    \u2264\n    l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Output For every test case, output the largest\npossible value of \n    a \n     b\n over all pairs \n    (a, b)\n of integers\nfor which \n    r\n    \u2265 a \n    \u2265 b \n    \u2265 l\n. Example Input 4 1 1 999999999\n1000000000 8 26 1 999999999 Output 0 1 12 499999999 Note In the first test\ncase, the only allowed pair is \n    (a, b) = (1, 1)\n, for which \n    a \n     b\n    = 1 \n     1 = 0\n. In the second test case, the optimal choice is pair\n\n    (a, b) = (1000000000, 999999999)\n, for which \n    a \n     b = 1\n.\n\n",
