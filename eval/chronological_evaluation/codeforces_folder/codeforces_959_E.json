        "description": "Ehab is interested in the bitwise-xor operation and the special graphs.\nMahmoud gave him a problem that combines both. He has a complete graph\nconsisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1. For all 0 \u2264 u < v < n,\nvertex u and vertex v are connected with an undirected edge that has weight\n(where is the bitwise-xor operation). Can you find the weight of the minimum\nspanning tree of that graph? You can read about complete graphs in\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph You can read about the minimum\nspanning tree in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree The\nweight of the minimum spanning tree is the sum of the weights on the edges\nincluded in it. Input The only line contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^12), the\nnumber of vertices in the graph. Output The only line contains an integer x,\nthe weight of the graph's minimum spanning tree. Example Input 4 Output 4 Note\nIn the first sample: The weight of the minimum spanning tree is 1+2+1=4.\n\n",
