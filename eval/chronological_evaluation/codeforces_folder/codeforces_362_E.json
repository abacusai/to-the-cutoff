        "description": "A little boy Petya dreams of growing up and becoming the Head Berland Plumber.\nHe is thinking of the problems he will have to solve in the future.\nUnfortunately, Petya is too inexperienced, so you are about to solve one of\nsuch problems for Petya, the one he's the most interested in. The Berland\ncapital has n water tanks numbered from 1 to n. These tanks are connected by\nunidirectional pipes in some manner. Any pair of water tanks is connected by\nat most one pipe in each direction. Each pipe has a strictly positive integer\nwidth. Width determines the number of liters of water per a unit of time this\npipe can transport. The water goes to the city from the main water tank (its\nnumber is 1). The water must go through some pipe path and get to the sewer\ntank with cleaning system (its number is n). Petya wants to increase the width\nof some subset of pipes by at most k units in total so that the width of each\npipe remains integer. Help him determine the maximum amount of water that can\nbe transmitted per a unit of time from the main tank to the sewer tank after\nsuch operation is completed. Input The first line contains two space-separated\nintegers n and k (2 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1000). Then follow n lines, each line\ncontains n integers separated by single spaces. The i + 1-th row and j-th\ncolumn contain number cij \u2014 the width of the pipe that goes from tank i to\ntank j (0 \u2264 cij \u2264 10^6, cii = 0). If cij = 0, then there is no pipe from tank\ni to tank j. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the maximum amount of water that\ncan be transmitted from the main tank to the sewer tank per a unit of time.\nExamples Input 5 7 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 4 10 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 0 0 0 Output\n10 Input 5 10 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 4 100 0 0 0 0 Output 5\nNote In the first test Petya can increase width of the pipe that goes from the\n1st to the 2nd water tank by 7 units. In the second test Petya can increase\nwidth of the pipe that goes from the 1st to the 2nd water tank by 4 units,\nfrom the 2nd to the 3rd water tank by 3 units, from the 3rd to the 4th water\ntank by 2 units and from the 4th to 5th water tank by 1 unit.\n\n",
