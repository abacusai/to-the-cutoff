        "name": "New Year Garland",
        "description": "Polycarp is sad \u2014 New Year is coming in few days but there is still no snow in\nhis city. To bring himself New Year mood, he decided to decorate his house\nwith some garlands. The local store introduced a new service this year, called\n\"Build your own garland\". So you can buy some red, green and blue lamps,\nprovide them and the store workers will solder a single garland of them. The\nresulting garland will have all the lamps you provided put in a line.\nMoreover, no pair of lamps of the same color will be adjacent to each other in\nthis garland! For example, if you provide \n    3\n red, \n    3\n green and\n\n    3\n blue lamps, the resulting garland can look like this: \"RGBRBGBGR\"\n(\"RGB\" being the red, green and blue color, respectively). Note that it's ok\nto have lamps of the same color on the ends of the garland. However, if you\nprovide, say, \n    1\n red, \n    10\n green and \n    2\n blue lamps then the\nstore workers won't be able to build any garland of them. Any garland\nconsisting of these lamps will have at least one pair of lamps of the same\ncolor adjacent to each other. Note that the store workers should use all the\nlamps you provided. So Polycarp has bought some sets of lamps and now he wants\nto know if the store workers can build a garland from each of them. Input The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of sets of lamps Polycarp has bought. Each of the next \n    t\n lines\ncontains three integers \n    r\n, \n    g\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 r, g, b \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) \u2014 the number of red, green and blue lamps in the set, respectively.\nOutput Print \n    t\n lines \u2014 for each set of lamps print \"Yes\" if the store\nworkers can build a garland from them and \"No\" otherwise. Example Input 3 3 3\n3 1 10 2 2 1 1 Output Yes No Yes Note The first two sets are desribed in the\nstatement. The third set produces garland \"RBRG\", for example.\n\n",
