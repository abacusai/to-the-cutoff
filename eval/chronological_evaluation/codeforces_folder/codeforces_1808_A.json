        "description": "Olympus City recently launched the production of personal starships. Now\neveryone on Mars can buy one and fly to other planets inexpensively. Each\nstarship has a number \u2014some positive integer \n    x\n. Let's define the\nluckiness of a number \n    x\n as the difference between the largest and\nsmallest digits of that number. For example, \n    142857\n has \n    8\n as its\nlargest digit and \n    1\n as its smallest digit, so its luckiness is\n\n    8-1=7\n. And the number \n    111\n has all digits equal to \n    1\n, so its\nluckiness is zero. Hateehc is a famous Martian blogger who often flies to\ndifferent corners of the solar system. To release interesting videos even\nfaster, he decided to buy himself a starship. When he came to the store, he\nsaw starships with numbers from \n    l\n to \n    r\n inclusively. While in the\nstore, Hateehc wanted to find a starship with the luckiest number. Since there\nare a lot of starships in the store, and Hateehc can't program, you have to\nhelp the blogger and write a program that answers his question. Input The\nfirst line contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10\n     000\n) \u2014the\nnumber of test cases. Each of the following \n    t\n lines contains a\ndescription of the test case. The description consists of two integers \n    l\n\nand \n    r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the largest and smallest\nnumbers of the starships in the store. Output Print \n    t\n lines, one line\nfor each test case, containing the luckiest starship number in the store. If\nthere are several ways to choose the luckiest number, output any of them.\nExample Input 5 59 63 42 49 15 15 53 57 1 100 Output 60 49 15 57 90 Note Let's\nlook at two test examples: the luckiness of the number \n    59\n is \n    9 - 5 =\n    4\n; the luckiness of \n    60\n equals \n    6 - 0 = 6\n; the luckiness of\n\n    61\n equals \n    6 - 1 = 5\n; the luckiness of \n    62\n equals \n    6 - 2 =\n    4\n; the luckiness of \n    63\n is \n    6 - 3 = 3\n. Thus, the luckiest number\nis \n    60\n.In the fifth test example, the luckiest number is \n    90\n.\n\n",
