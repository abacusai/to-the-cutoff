        "description": "Petya is the most responsible worker in the Research Institute. So he was\nasked to make a very important experiment: to melt the chocolate bar with a\nnew laser device. The device consists of a rectangular field of n \u00d7 m cells\nand a robotic arm. Each cell of the field is a 1 \u00d7 1 square. The robotic arm\nhas two lasers pointed at the field perpendicularly to its surface. At any one\ntime lasers are pointed at the centres of some two cells. Since the lasers are\non the robotic hand, their movements are synchronized \u2014 if you move one of the\nlasers by a vector, another one moves by the same vector. The following facts\nabout the experiment are known: initially the whole field is covered with a\nchocolate bar of the size n \u00d7 m, both lasers are located above the field and\nare active; the chocolate melts within one cell of the field at which the\nlaser is pointed; all moves of the robotic arm should be parallel to the sides\nof the field, after each move the lasers should be pointed at the centres of\nsome two cells; at any one time both lasers should be pointed at the field.\nPetya doesn't want to become a second Gordon Freeman. You are given n, m and\nthe cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), where the lasers are initially pointed at (xi\nis a column number, yi is a row number). Rows are numbered from 1 to m from\ntop to bottom and columns are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. You are\nto find the amount of cells of the field on which the chocolate can't be\nmelted in the given conditions. Input The first line contains one integer\nnumber t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10000) \u2014 the number of test sets. Each of the following t\nlines describes one test set. Each line contains integer numbers n, m, x1, y1,\nx2, y2, separated by a space (2 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x1, x2 \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 y1, y2 \u2264\nm). Cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are distinct. Output Each of the t lines of\nthe output should contain the answer to the corresponding input test set.\nExamples Input 2 4 4 1 1 3 3 4 3 1 1 2 2 Output 8 2\n\n",
