        "description": "As Gerald sets the table, Alexander sends the greeting cards, and Sergey and\nhis twins create an army of clone snowmen, Gennady writes a New Year contest.\nThe New Year contest begins at 18:00 (6.00 P.M.) on December 31 and ends at\n6:00 (6.00 A.M.) on January 1. There are n problems for the contest. The\npenalty time for each solved problem is set as the distance from the moment of\nsolution submission to the New Year in minutes. For example, the problem\nsubmitted at 21:00 (9.00 P.M.) gets penalty time 180, as well as the problem\nsubmitted at 3:00 (3.00 A.M.). The total penalty time is calculated as the sum\nof penalty time for all solved problems. It is allowed to submit a problem\nexactly at the end of the contest, at 6:00 (6.00 A.M.). Gennady opened the\nproblems exactly at 18:00 (6.00 P.M.) and managed to estimate their complexity\nduring the first 10 minutes of the contest. He believes that writing a\nsolution for the i-th problem will take ai minutes. Gennady can submit a\nsolution for evaluation at any time after he completes writing it. Probably he\nwill have to distract from writing some solution to send the solutions of\nother problems for evaluation. The time needed to send the solutions can be\nneglected, i.e. this time can be considered to equal zero. Gennady can\nsimultaneously submit multiple solutions. Besides, he can move at any time\nfrom writing one problem to another, and then return to the first problem from\nthe very same place, where he has left it. Thus the total solution writing\ntime of the i-th problem always equals ai minutes. Of course, Gennady does not\ncommit wrong attempts, and his solutions are always correct and are accepted\nfrom the first attempt. He can begin to write the solutions starting from\n18:10 (6.10 P.M.). Help Gennady choose from the strategies that help him solve\nthe maximum possible number of problems, the one with which his total penalty\ntime will be minimum. Input The first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100)\n\u2014 the number of the problems. The next line contains n space-separated\nintegers ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 720) \u2014 each number shows how much time in minutes\nGennady will spend writing a solution to the problem. Output Print two\nintegers \u2014 the number of problems Gennady will solve and the total penalty\ntime considering that he chooses the optimal strategy. Examples Input 3 30 330\n720 Output 2 10 Note In the sample, one of Gennady's possible optimal\nstrategies is as follows. At 18:10 (6:10 PM) he begins to write the first\nproblem and solves it in 30 minutes (18:40 or 6.40 P.M.). At 18:40 (6.40 P.M.)\nhe begins to write the second problem. There are 320 minutes left before the\nNew Year, so Gennady does not have the time to finish writing the second\nproblem before the New Year. At 0:00 (12.00 A.M.) he distracts from the second\nproblem, submits the first one, and returns immediately to writing the second\nproblem. At 0:10 (0.10 A.M.), he completes the solution for the second\nproblem, submits it and gets 10 minute penalty time. Note that as the total\nduration of the contest is 720 minutes and Gennady has already spent 10\nminutes on reading the problems, he will not have time to solve the third\nproblem during the contest. Yes, such problems happen to exist. Competitions\nby the given rules are held annually on the site http://b23.ru/3wvc\n\n",
