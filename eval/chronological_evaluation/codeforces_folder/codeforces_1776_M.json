        "description": "The \"Parmigiana di melanzane\" is a typical Italian dish. Alessandro and Bianca\nhave very different tastes when it comes to it: Alessandro loves to eat\nParmigiana with seafood, but Bianca thinks it is an atrocity! To decide which\ningredients to include in the dish they prepare, they play the following game.\nThere are \n    n\n possible ingredients, labeled from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. The\nhigher the label, the closer the ingredient is to being seafood. The\ningredients are connected by \n    n - 1\n edges, in such a way as to form a\ntree. Alessandro and Bianca take turns, with Alessandro going first. They\nalternately choose a terminal ingredient \n    x\n, that is an ingredient\ncurrently connected to at most one other ingredient, and remove it from the\ntree. If the terminal ingredient \n    x\n was chosen by Alessandro, it goes in\nthe recipe; if it was chosen by Bianca, it is discarded. The taste of the\nParmigiana is measured as the maximum label of an ingredient in the recipe.\nAlessandro wants to maximize the taste, while Bianca wants to minimize the\ntaste. If both play optimally, what is the taste of the Parmigiana? Input The\nfirst line contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of ingredients. Each of the following \n    n-1\n lines contain two\nintegers \n    u_i\n and \n    v_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    u_i \n    \n    v_i\n) \u2014 the ingredients that the \n    i\n-th edge connects. It is guaranteed\nthat the edges form a tree (i.e., any pair of ingredients is connected by the\nedges, possibly indirectly). Output Print the value of the taste if both\nAlessandro and Bianca play optimally. Examples Input 4 1 2 1 3 1 4 Output 4\nInput 5 1 5 5 3 3 4 4 2 Output 3 Note In the first sample, Alessandro can\nchoose terminal ingredient \n    4\n in the first turn. This ingredient is added\nto the recipe. Since \n    4\n is the maximum label of an ingredient, the taste\nis \n    4\n regardless of the choices that follow. In the second sample, Bianca\ncan make sure that neither ingredient \n    4\n nor \n    5\n are included in the\nrecipe, in which case Alessandro can include \n    3\n. Thus, the taste is\n\n    3\n.\n\n",
