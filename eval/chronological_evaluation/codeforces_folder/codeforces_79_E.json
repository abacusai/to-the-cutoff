        "description": "Fox Ciel safely returned to her castle, but there was something wrong with the\nsecurity system of the castle: sensors attached in the castle were covering\nher. Ciel is at point (1, 1) of the castle now, and wants to move to point (n,\nn), which is the position of her room. By one step, Ciel can move from point\n(x, y) to either (x + 1, y) (rightward) or (x, y + 1) (upward). In her castle,\nc^2 sensors are set at points (a + i, b + j) (for every integer i and j such\nthat: 0 \u2264 i < c, 0 \u2264 j < c). Each sensor has a count value and decreases its\ncount value every time Ciel moves. Initially, the count value of each sensor\nis t. Every time Ciel moves to point (x, y), the count value of a sensor at\npoint (u, v) decreases by (|u - x| + |v - y|). When the count value of some\nsensor becomes strictly less than 0, the sensor will catch Ciel as a\nsuspicious individual! Determine whether Ciel can move from (1, 1) to (n, n)\nwithout being caught by a sensor, and if it is possible, output her steps.\nAssume that Ciel can move to every point even if there is a censor on the\npoint. Input In the first line there are five integers n, t, a, b, c (2 \u2264 n \u2264\n2\u00b710^5, 0 \u2264 t \u2264 10^14, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 n - c + 1, 1 \u2264 b \u2264 n - c + 1, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 n).\nPlease do not use the \nC++. It is preferred to use the cin stream (also you may use the \nspecificator). Output If Ciel's objective is possible, output in first line 2n\n- 2 characters that represent her feasible steps, where i-th character is R if\ni-th step is moving rightward, or U if moving upward. If there are several\nsolution, output lexicographically first one. Character R is lexicographically\nearlier than the character U. If her objective is impossible, output\nImpossible. Examples Input 5 25 2 4 1 Output RRUURURU Input 3 6 1 2 2 Output\nURUR Input 3 5 1 2 2 Output Impossible Input 20 492 11 4 8 Output\nRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUURUUUUURRUUUUUUUUU Note The answers for the first sample\nand the second sample are shown on the picture: Here, a red point represents a\npoint that contains a sensor.\n\n",
