        "description": "Friends are going to play console. They have two joysticks and only one\ncharger for them. Initially first joystick is charged at a1 percent and second\none is charged at a2 percent. You can connect charger to a joystick only at\nthe beginning of each minute. In one minute joystick either discharges by 2\npercent (if not connected to a charger) or charges by 1 percent (if connected\nto a charger). Game continues while both joysticks have a positive charge.\nHence, if at the beginning of minute some joystick is charged by 1 percent, it\nhas to be connected to a charger, otherwise the game stops. If some joystick\ncompletely discharges (its charge turns to 0), the game also stops. Determine\nthe maximum number of minutes that game can last. It is prohibited to pause\nthe game, i. e. at each moment both joysticks should be enabled. It is allowed\nfor joystick to be charged by more than 100 percent. Input The first line of\nthe input contains two positive integers a1 and a2 (1 \u2264 a1, a2 \u2264 100), the\ninitial charge level of first and second joystick respectively. Output Output\nthe only integer, the maximum number of minutes that the game can last. Game\ncontinues until some joystick is discharged. Examples Input 3 5 Output 6 Input\n4 4 Output 5 Note In the first sample game lasts for 6 minute by using the\nfollowing algorithm: at the beginning of the first minute connect first\njoystick to the charger, by the end of this minute first joystick is at 4\nsecond is at 3\nsecond minute the first joystick is at 5\nof the third minute connect second joystick to the charger, after this minute\nthe first joystick is at 3\nwithout changing charger, by the end of the fourth minute first joystick is at\n1\njoystick to the charger, after this minute the first joystick is at 2\nsecond one is at 1\njoystick to the charger, after this minute the first joystick is at 0\nsecond one is at 2\nand the game is stopped.\n\n",
