        "description": "Alice, the president of club FCB, wants to build a team for the new volleyball\ntournament. The team should consist of \n    p\n players playing in \n    p\n\ndifferent positions. She also recognizes the importance of audience support,\nso she wants to select \n    k\n people as part of the audience. There are\n\n    n\n people in Byteland. Alice needs to select exactly \n    p\n players, one\nfor each position, and exactly \n    k\n members of the audience from this pool\nof \n    n\n people. Her ultimate goal is to maximize the total strength of the\nclub. The \n    i\n-th of the \n    n\n persons has an integer \n    a_i\n\nassociated with him \u2014 the strength he adds to the club if he is selected as a\nmember of the audience. For each person \n    i\n and for each position \n    j\n,\nAlice knows \n    s_i, j\n \u2014 the strength added by the \n    i\n-th person to\nthe club if he is selected to play in the \n    j\n-th position. Each person can\nbe selected at most once as a player or a member of the audience. You have to\nchoose exactly one player for each position. Since Alice is busy, she needs\nyou to help her find the maximum possible strength of the club that can be\nachieved by an optimal choice of players and the audience. Input The first\nline contains \n    3\n integers \n    n,p,k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5, 1\n    \n    \u2264 p \n    \u2264 7, 1 \n    \u2264 k, p+k \n    \u2264 n\n). The second line contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n. (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i\n    \u2264\n    10^9\n). The \n    i\n-th of the next \n    n\n lines contains \n    p\n integers\n\n    s_i, 1, s_i, 2, \n    \u2026, s_i, p\n. (\n    1 \n    \u2264 s_i,j\n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) Output Print a single integer \n    res\n \u2014 the maximum possible\nstrength of the club. Examples Input 4 1 2 1 16 10 3 18 19 13 15 Output 44\nInput 6 2 3 78 93 9 17 13 78 80 97 30 52 26 17 56 68 60 36 84 55 Output 377\nInput 3 2 1 500 498 564 100002 3 422332 2 232323 1 Output 422899 Note In the\nfirst sample, we can select person \n    1\n to play in the \n    1\n-st position\nand persons \n    2\n and \n    3\n as audience members. Then the total strength\nof the club will be equal to \n    a_2+a_3+s_1,1\n.\n\n",
