        "description": "Bob loves everything sweet. His favorite chocolate bar consists of pieces,\neach piece may contain a nut. Bob wants to break the bar of chocolate into\nmultiple pieces so that each part would contain exactly one nut and any break\nline goes between two adjacent pieces. You are asked to calculate the number\nof ways he can do it. Two ways to break chocolate are considered distinct if\none of them contains a break between some two adjacent pieces and the other\none doesn't. Please note, that if Bob doesn't make any breaks, all the bar\nwill form one piece and it still has to have exactly one nut. Input The first\nline of the input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of pieces in\nthe chocolate bar. The second line contains n integers ai (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 1), where\n0 represents a piece without the nut and 1 stands for a piece with the nut.\nOutput Print the number of ways to break the chocolate into multiple parts so\nthat each part would contain exactly one nut. Examples Input 3 0 1 0 Output 1\nInput 5 1 0 1 0 1 Output 4 Note In the first sample there is exactly one nut,\nso the number of ways equals 1 \u2014 Bob shouldn't make any breaks. In the second\nsample you can break the bar in four ways: 10|10|1 1|010|1 10|1|01 1|01|01\n\n",
