        "description": "Winnie-the-Pooh likes honey very much! That is why he decided to visit his\nfriends. Winnie has got three best friends: Rabbit, Owl and Eeyore, each of\nthem lives in his own house. There are winding paths between each pair of\nhouses. The length of a path between Rabbit's and Owl's houses is a meters,\nbetween Rabbit's and Eeyore's house is b meters, between Owl's and Eeyore's\nhouse is c meters. For enjoying his life and singing merry songs Winnie-the-\nPooh should have a meal n times a day. Now he is in the Rabbit's house and has\na meal for the first time. Each time when in the friend's house where Winnie\nis now the supply of honey is about to end, Winnie leaves that house. If\nWinnie has not had a meal the required amount of times, he comes out from the\nhouse and goes to someone else of his two friends. For this he chooses one of\ntwo adjacent paths, arrives to the house on the other end and visits his\nfriend. You may assume that when Winnie is eating in one of his friend's\nhouse, the supply of honey in other friend's houses recover (most probably,\nthey go to the supply store). Winnie-the-Pooh does not like physical activity.\nHe wants to have a meal n times, traveling minimum possible distance. Help him\nto find this distance. Input First line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014\nnumber of visits. Second line contains an integer a (1 \u2264 a \u2264 100) \u2014 distance\nbetween Rabbit's and Owl's houses. Third line contains an integer b (1 \u2264 b \u2264\n100) \u2014 distance between Rabbit's and Eeyore's houses. Fourth line contains an\ninteger c (1 \u2264 c \u2264 100) \u2014 distance between Owl's and Eeyore's houses. Output\nOutput one number \u2014 minimum distance in meters Winnie must go through to have\na meal n times. Examples Input 3 2 3 1 Output 3 Input 1 2 3 5 Output 0 Note In\nthe first test case the optimal path for Winnie is the following: first have a\nmeal in Rabbit's house, then in Owl's house, then in Eeyore's house. Thus he\nwill pass the distance 2 + 1 = 3. In the second test case Winnie has a meal in\nRabbit's house and that is for him. So he doesn't have to walk anywhere at\nall.\n\n",
