        "description": "An expedition group flew from planet ACM-1 to Earth in order to study the\nbipedal species (its representatives don't even have antennas on their\nheads!). The flying saucer, on which the brave pioneers set off, consists of\nthree sections. These sections are connected by a chain: the 1-st section is\nadjacent only to the 2-nd one, the 2-nd one \u2014 to the 1-st and the 3-rd ones,\nthe 3-rd one \u2014 only to the 2-nd one. The transitions are possible only between\nthe adjacent sections. The spacecraft team consists of n aliens. Each of them\nis given a rank \u2014 an integer from 1 to n. The ranks of all astronauts are\ndistinct. The rules established on the Saucer, state that an alien may move\nfrom section a to section b only if it is senior in rank to all aliens who are\nin the segments a and b (besides, the segments a and b are of course required\nto be adjacent). Any alien requires exactly 1 minute to make a move. Besides,\nsafety regulations require that no more than one alien moved at the same\nminute along the ship. Alien A is senior in rank to alien B, if the number\nindicating rank A, is more than the corresponding number for B. At the moment\nthe whole saucer team is in the 3-rd segment. They all need to move to the\n1-st segment. One member of the crew, the alien with the identification number\nCFR-140, decided to calculate the minimum time (in minutes) they will need to\nperform this task. Help CFR-140, figure out the minimum time (in minutes) that\nall the astronauts will need to move from the 3-rd segment to the 1-st one.\nSince this number can be rather large, count it modulo m. Input The first line\ncontains two space-separated integers: n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the number\nof aliens on the saucer and the number, modulo which you should print the\nanswer, correspondingly. Output Print a single number \u2014 the answer to the\nproblem modulo m. Examples Input 1 10 Output 2 Input 3 8 Output 2 Note In the\nfirst sample the only crew member moves from segment 3 to segment 2, and then\nfrom segment 2 to segment 1 without any problems. Thus, the whole moving will\ntake two minutes. To briefly describe the movements in the second sample we\nwill use value , which would correspond to an alien with rank i moving from\nthe segment in which it is at the moment, to the segment number j. Using these\nvalues, we will describe the movements between the segments in the second\nsample: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ; In total: the\naliens need 26 moves. The remainder after dividing 26 by 8 equals 2, so the\nanswer to this test is 2.\n\n",
