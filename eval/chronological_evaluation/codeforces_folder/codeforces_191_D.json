        "description": "Berland is very concerned with privacy, so almost all plans and blueprints are\nsecret. However, a spy of the neighboring state managed to steal the Bertown\nsubway scheme. The Bertown Subway has n stations, numbered from 1 to n, and m\nbidirectional tunnels connecting them. All Bertown Subway consists of lines.\nTo be more precise, there are two types of lines: circular and radial. A\nradial line is a sequence of stations v1, ..., vk (k > 1), where stations vi\nand vi + 1 (i < k) are connected by a tunnel and no station occurs in the line\nmore than once (vi \u2260 vj for i \u2260 j). A loop line is a series of stations, v1,\n..., vk (k > 2), where stations vi \u0438 vi + 1 are connected by a tunnel. In\naddition, stations v1 and vk are also connected by a tunnel. No station is\noccurs in the loop line more than once. Note that a single station can be\npassed by any number of lines. According to Berland standards, there can't be\nmore than one tunnel between two stations and each tunnel belongs to exactly\none line. Naturally, each line has at least one tunnel. Between any two\nstations there is the way along the subway tunnels. In addition, in terms of\ngraph theory, a subway is a vertex cactus: if we consider the subway as a\ngraph in which the stations are the vertexes and the edges are tunnels, then\neach vertex lies on no more than one simple cycle. Unfortunately, scheme,\nstolen by the spy, had only the stations and the tunnels. It was impossible to\ndetermine to which line every tunnel corresponds. But to sabotage\nsuccessfully, the spy needs to know what minimum and maximum number of lines\nmay be in the Bertown subway. Help him! Input The first line contains two\nintegers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 0 \u2264 m \u2264 3\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of stations and\nthe number of tunnels, correspondingly. Each of the next m lines contain two\nintegers \u2014 the numbers of stations connected by the corresponding tunnel. The\nstations are numbered with integers from 1 to n. It is guaranteed that the\ngraph that corresponds to the subway has no multiple edges or loops, it is\nconnected and it is a vertex cactus. Output Print two numbers \u2014 the minimum\nand maximum number of lines correspondingly.
