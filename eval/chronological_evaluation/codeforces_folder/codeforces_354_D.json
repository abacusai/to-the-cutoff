        "description": "Vasya and Petya are using an interesting data storing structure: a pyramid.\nThe pyramid consists of n rows, the i-th row contains i cells. Each row is\nshifted half a cell to the left relative to the previous row. The cells are\nnumbered by integers from 1 to as shown on the picture below. An example of a\npyramid at n = 5 is: This data structure can perform operations of two types:\nChange the value of a specific cell. It is described by three integers: \"t i\nv\", where t = 1 (the type of operation), i \u2014 the number of the cell to change\nand v the value to assign to the cell. Change the value of some subpyramid.\nThe picture shows a highlighted subpyramid with the top in cell 5. It is\ndescribed by s + 2 numbers: \"t i v1 v2 ... vs\", where t = 2, i \u2014 the number of\nthe top cell of the pyramid, s \u2014 the size of the subpyramid (the number of\ncells it has), vj \u2014 the value you should assign to the j-th cell of the\nsubpyramid. Formally: a subpyramid with top at the i-th cell of the k-th row\n(the 5-th cell is the second cell of the third row) will contain cells from\nrows from k to n, the (k + p)-th row contains cells from the i-th to the (i +\np)-th (0 \u2264 p \u2264 n - k). Vasya and Petya had two identical pyramids. Vasya\nchanged some cells in his pyramid and he now wants to send his changes to\nPetya. For that, he wants to find a sequence of operations at which Petya can\nrepeat all Vasya's changes. Among all possible sequences, Vasya has to pick\nthe minimum one (the one that contains the fewest numbers). You have a pyramid\nof n rows with k changed cells. Find the sequence of operations which result\nin each of the k changed cells being changed by at least one operation. Among\nall the possible sequences pick the one that contains the fewest numbers.\nInput The first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 10^5). The next\nk lines contain the coordinates of the modified cells ri and ci (1 \u2264 ci \u2264 ri \u2264\nn) \u2014 the row and the cell's number in the row. All cells are distinct. Output\nPrint a single number showing how many numbers the final sequence has.\nExamples Input 4 5 3 1 3 3 4 1 4 3 4 4 Output 10 Input 7 11 2 2 3 1 4 3 5 1 5\n2 5 5 6 4 7 2 7 3 7 4 7 5 Output 26 Note One of the possible solutions of the\nfirst sample consists of two operations: 2 4 v4 v7 v8 2 6 v6 v9 v10 The\npicture shows the changed cells color-highlighted. The subpyramid used by the\nfirst operation is highlighted blue and the subpyramid used by the first\noperation is highlighted yellow:\n\n",
