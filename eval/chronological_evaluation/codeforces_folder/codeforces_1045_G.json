        "description": "In the last mission, MDCS has successfully shipped \n    N\n AI robots to Mars.\nBefore they start exploring, system initialization is required so they are\narranged in a line. Every robot can be described with three numbers: position\n(\n    x_i\n), radius of sight (\n    r_i\n) and IQ (\n    q_i\n). Since they are\nintelligent robots, some of them will talk if they see each other. Radius of\nsight is inclusive, so robot can see other all robots in range \n    [x_i - r_i,\n    x_i + r_i]\n. But they don't walk to talk with anybody, but only with robots\nwho have similar IQ. By similar IQ we mean that their absolute difference\nisn't more than \n    K\n. Help us and calculate how many pairs of robots are\ngoing to talk with each other, so we can timely update their software and\navoid any potential quarrel. Input The first line contains two integers,\nnumbers \n    N (1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 10^5)\n and \n    K (0 \n    \u2264 K \n    \u2264 20)\n.\nNext \n    N\n lines contain three numbers each \n    x_i, r_i, q_i (0 \n    \u2264\n    x_i,r_i,q_i \n    \u2264 10^9)\n \u2014 position, radius of sight and IQ of every robot\nrespectively. Output Output contains only one number \u2014 solution to the\nproblem. Example Input 3 2 3 6 1 7 3 10 10 5 8 Output 1 Note The first robot\ncan see the second, but not vice versa. The first robot can't even see the\nthird. The second and the third robot can see each other and their IQs don't\ndiffer more than 2 so only one conversation will happen.\n\n",
