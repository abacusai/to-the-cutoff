        "name": "Palindromes Coloring",
        "description": "You have a string \n    s\n consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters. You\ncan color some letters in colors from \n    1\n to \n    k\n. It is not necessary\nto paint all the letters. But for each color, there must be a letter painted\nin that color. Then you can swap any two symbols painted in the same color as\nmany times as you want. After that, \n    k\n strings will be created,\n\n    i\n-th of them will contain all the characters colored in the color\n\n    i\n, written in the order of their sequence in the string \n    s\n. Your\ntask is to color the characters of the string so that all the resulting\n\n    k\n strings are palindromes, and the length of the shortest of these\n\n    k\n strings is as large as possible. Read the note for the first test case\nof the example if you need a clarification. Recall that a string is a\npalindrome if it reads the same way both from left to right and from right to\nleft. For example, the strings abacaba, cccc, z and dxd are palindromes, but\nthe strings abab and aaabaa \u2014 are not. Input The first line of input data\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of\ninput data sets in the test. The descriptions of the input data sets follow.\nThe first line of the description of each input data set contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of the string and the number of colors in which its letters can be\npainted. The second line of the description of each input data set contains a\nstring \n    s\n of length \n    n\n consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin\nalphabet. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not\nexceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each set of input data, output a\nsingle integer \u2014 the maximum length of the shortest palindrome string that can\nbe obtained. Example Input 10 8 2 bxyaxzay 6 3 aaaaaa 6 1 abcdef 6 6 abcdef 3\n2 dxd 11 2 abcabcabcac 6 6 sipkic 7 2 eatoohd 3 1 llw 6 2 bfvfbv Output 3 2 1\n1 1 5 1 1 3 3 Note In the first test case, \n    s\n=\"bxyaxzay\", \n    k=2\n. We\nuse indices in the string from \n    1\n to \n    8\n. The following coloring will\nwork:\n\n    \ud835\udc1b\n    \ud835\udc31\ud835\udc32\n    \ud835\udc1a\n    \ud835\udc31\ud835\udc33\n    \ud835\udc1a\n    \ud835\udc32\n\n(the letter z remained uncolored). After painting: swap two red characters\n(with the indices \n    1\n and \n    4\n), we get\n\n    \ud835\udc1a\n    \ud835\udc31\ud835\udc32\n    \ud835\udc1b\n    \ud835\udc31\ud835\udc33\n    \ud835\udc1a\n    \ud835\udc32\n;\nswap two blue characters (with the indices \n    5\n and \n    8\n), we get\n\n    \ud835\udc1a\n    \ud835\udc31\ud835\udc32\n    \ud835\udc1b\n    \ud835\udc32\ud835\udc33\n    \ud835\udc1a\n    \ud835\udc31\n.\nNow, for each of the two colors we write out the corresponding characters from\nleft to right, we get two strings\n\n    \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1a\n and\n\n    \ud835\udc31\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc31\n. Both of them are\npalindromes, the length of the shortest is \n    3\n. It can be shown that the\ngreatest length of the shortest palindrome cannot be achieved. In the second\nset of input data, the following coloring is suitable: \n    [1, 1, 2, 2, 3,\n    3]\n. There is no need to swap characters. Both received strings are equal to\naa, they are palindromes and their length is \n    2\n. In the third set of\ninput data, you can color any character and take it into a string. In the\nfourth set of input data, you can color the \n    i\nth character in the color\n\n    i\n. In the fifth set of input data can be colored in each of the colors\nof one character. In the sixth set of input data, the following coloring is\nsuitable: \n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\n. Rearrange the characters so\nas to get the palindromes abcba and acbca.\n\n",
