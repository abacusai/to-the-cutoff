        "name": "Asphalting Roads",
        "description": "City X consists of n vertical and n horizontal infinite roads, forming n \u00d7 n\nintersections. Roads (both vertical and horizontal) are numbered from 1 to n,\nand the intersections are indicated by the numbers of the roads that form\nthem. Sand roads have long been recognized out of date, so the decision was\nmade to asphalt them. To do this, a team of workers was hired and a schedule\nof work was made, according to which the intersections should be asphalted.\nRoad repairs are planned for n^2 days. On the i-th day of the team arrives at\nthe i-th intersection in the list and if none of the two roads that form the\nintersection were already asphalted they asphalt both roads. Otherwise, the\nteam leaves the intersection, without doing anything with the roads. According\nto the schedule of road works tell in which days at least one road will be\nasphalted. Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the number\nof vertical and horizontal roads in the city. Next n^2 lines contain the order\nof intersections in the schedule. The i-th of them contains two numbers hi, vi\n(1 \u2264 hi, vi \u2264 n), separated by a space, and meaning that the intersection that\ngoes i-th in the timetable is at the intersection of the hi-th horizontal and\nvi-th vertical roads. It is guaranteed that all the intersections in the\ntimetable are distinct. Output In the single line print the numbers of the\ndays when road works will be in progress in ascending order. The days are\nnumbered starting from 1. Examples Input 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 Output 1 4 Input 1\n1 1 Output 1 Note In the sample the brigade acts like that: On the first day\nthe brigade comes to the intersection of the 1-st horizontal and the 1-st\nvertical road. As none of them has been asphalted, the workers asphalt the\n1-st vertical and the 1-st horizontal road; On the second day the brigade of\nthe workers comes to the intersection of the 1-st horizontal and the 2-nd\nvertical road. The 2-nd vertical road hasn't been asphalted, but as the 1-st\nhorizontal road has been asphalted on the first day, the workers leave and do\nnot asphalt anything; On the third day the brigade of the workers come to the\nintersection of the 2-nd horizontal and the 1-st vertical road. The 2-nd\nhorizontal road hasn't been asphalted but as the 1-st vertical road has been\nasphalted on the first day, the workers leave and do not asphalt anything; On\nthe fourth day the brigade come to the intersection formed by the intersection\nof the 2-nd horizontal and 2-nd vertical road. As none of them has been\nasphalted, the workers asphalt the 2-nd vertical and the 2-nd horizontal road.\n\n",
