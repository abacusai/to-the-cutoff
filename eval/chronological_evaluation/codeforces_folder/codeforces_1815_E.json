        "description": "Bosco is studying the behaviour of particles. He decided to investigate on the\npeculiar behaviour of the so-called \"four-one-two\" particle. He does the\nfollowing: There is a line of length \n    n+1\n, where the topmost point is\nposition \n    0\n and bottommost is position \n    n+1\n. The particle is\ninitially (at time \n    t=0\n) at position \n    0\n and heading downwards. The\nparticle moves at the speed of \n    1\n unit per second. There are \n    n\n\noscillators at positions \n    1,2,\n    \u2026,n\n. Each oscillator can be\ndescribed by a binary string. The initial state of each oscillator is the\nfirst character of its binary string. When the particle hits with an\noscillator, the particle reverses its direction if its current state is\n\n    \n and continues to move at the same direction if its current\nstate is \n    \n, and that oscillator moves on to the next state\n(the next state of the last state is defined as the first state).\nAdditionally, the particle always reverses its direction when it is at\nposition \n    0\n or \n    n+1\n at time \n    t > 0\n. Bosco would like to know\nthe cycle length of the movement of particle. The cycle length is defined as\nthe minimum value of \n    c\n such that for any time \n    t \n    \u2265 0\n, the\nposition of the particle at time \n    t\n is same as the position of the\nparticle at time \n    t+c\n. It can be proved that such value \n    c\n always\nexists. As he realises the answer might be too large, he asks you to output\nyour answer modulo \n    998244353\n. Input The first line contains an integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u226410^6\n) \u2014 the number of oscillators. The \n    i\n-th\nof the next \n    n\n line contains a binary string \n    s_i\n\n(\n    1\n    \u2264\n    |s_i\n    |\n    \u226410^6\n) \u2014 the binary string, that contains\nonly characters \n    \n and \n    \n, describing the\noscillator at position \n    i\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of all\n\n    |s_i|\n does not exceed \n    10^6\n. Output Output a single integer integer\n\u2014 the cycle length of the movement of the particle, modulo \n    998244353\n.\nExamples Input 1 00 Output 4 Input 2 01 010 Output 16 Input 4 0101 000 1 01\nOutput 12 Input 4 01010 0001 11 0001 Output 120 Note In the first sample, the\nonly oscillator at position \n    1\n always has state \n    \n. At\ntime moments \n    0,1,2,3\n positions the particle are \n    0,1,2,1\n\nrespectively. Then the same positions will be repeated, so \n    c=4\n.\nAnimation for the second sample: here or a smoother animation.\n\n",
