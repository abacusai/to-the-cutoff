        "name": "Laboratory on Pluto",
        "description": "As you know, Martian scientists are actively engaged in space research. One of\nthe highest priorities is Pluto. In order to study this planet in more detail,\nit was decided to build a laboratory on Pluto. It is known that the lab will\nbe built of \n    n\n square blocks of equal size. For convenience, we will\nassume that Pluto's surface is a plane divided by vertical and horizontal\nlines into unit squares. Each square is either occupied by a lab block or not,\nand only \n    n\n squares are occupied. Since each block is square, it has four\nwalls. If a wall is adjacent to another block, it is considered inside,\notherwise \u2014 outside. Pluto is famous for its extremely cold temperatures, so\nthe outside walls of the lab must be insulated. One unit of insulation per\nexterior wall would be required. Thus, the greater the total length of the\noutside walls of the lab (i. e., its perimeter), the more insulation will be\nneeded. Consider the lab layout in the figure below. It shows that the lab\nconsists of \n    n = 33\n blocks, and all the blocks have a total of \n    24\n\noutside walls, i. e. \n    24\n units of insulation will be needed. You should\nbuild the lab optimally, i. e., minimize the amount of insulation. On the\nother hand, there may be many optimal options, so scientists may be interested\nin the number of ways to build the lab using the minimum amount of insulation,\nmodulo a prime number \n    m\n. Two ways are considered the same if they are\nthe same when overlapping without turning. Thus, if a lab plan is rotated by\n\n    90^\n    \u2218\n, such a new plan can be considered a separate way. To help\nscientists explore Pluto, you need to write a program that solves these\ndifficult problems. Input The first line contains two integers \n    t\n and\n\n    u\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 u \n    \u2264 2\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases and the test type. If \n    u=1\n, you need to find any way\nto build the lab in an optimal way, and if \n    u=2\n, you need to calculate\nthe number of ways to do it. If \n    u=2\n, then in the following line of input\nthere is a prime integer \n    m\n (\n    10^8 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^9 + 9\n), modulo\nwhich you need to calculate the number of ways. Each of the following \n    t\n\nlines of input contains a description of a test case consisting of one integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 4\n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of blocks the lab\nshould consist of. It is guaranteed that if \n    u=1\n, then the sum of \n    n\n\non all test cases does not exceed \n    8\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For each test\ncase, output the answers in the format below, separating them with a newline.\nThe output format depends on \n    u\n in the input data. If \n    u=1\n, in the\nfirst line you need to print two integers \n    h\n and \n    w\n \u2014the height and\nwidth of the area in which the lab should be built. Then, in each of the\nfollowing \n    h\n lines, you must output a line \n    s_i\n consisting of\n\n    w\n characters \"#\" and \".\". If the \n    j\n-th character of the row\n\n    s_i\n is \"#\", then the corresponding square must contain a block of\nlaboratory, otherwise, it is considered empty. Thus, we get a matrix of\nsymbols. The condition must also be met that the first and last rows of the\nmatrix, as well as the first and last columns, must have at least one\ncharacter \"#\", otherwise we could output the same lab layout, but with smaller\n\n    h\n and \n    w\n. If there are many options to build an optimal lab, you\ncan print any of them. If \n    u=2\n, you need to print two integers \n    p\n\nand \n    c\n \u2014 the number of outside walls in an optimal lab, and the remainder\nof the number of ways by prime modulo \n    m\n. Examples Input 3 1 1 2 7 Output\n1 1 # 1 2 ## 2 4 .### #### Input 3 2 1000000007 1 2 7 Output 4 1 6 2 12 22\nNote Consider the second example. If \n    n=1\n, the only way to build a lab is\nto place a single block. In this case, the perimeter will be equal to four.\nWhen \n    n=2\n, you must place two blocks side by side. This can be done\neither vertically or horizontally, so there are two ways. It is easy to see\nthat the lab has six outside walls in this case. For \n    n=7\n, all the\n\n    22\n optimal plans are shown in the picture below.\n\n",
