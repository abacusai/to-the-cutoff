        "description": "Ira loves Spanish flamenco dance very much. She decided to start her own dance\nstudio and found \n    n\n students, \n    i\nth of whom has level \n    a_i\n. Ira\ncan choose several of her students and set a dance with them. So she can set a\nhuge number of dances, but she is only interested in magnificent dances. The\ndance is called magnificent if the following is true: exactly \n    m\n students\nparticipate in the dance; levels of all dancers are pairwise distinct; levels\nof every two dancers have an absolute difference strictly less than \n    m\n.\nFor example, if \n    m = 3\n and \n    a = [4, 2, 2, 3, 6]\n, the following\ndances are magnificent (students participating in the dance are highlighted in\nred): \n    [\n    4, 2, \n    2, \n    3, 6]\n,\n\n    [\n    4, \n    2, 2, \n    3, 6]\n. At the\nsame time dances \n    [\n    4, 2, 2, \n    3, 6]\n, \n    [4,\n    \n    2, \n    2, \n    3, 6]\n,\n\n    [\n    4, 2, 2, \n    3, \n    6]\n are not\nmagnificent. In the dance \n    [\n    4, 2, 2, \n    3, 6]\n\nonly \n    2\n students participate, although \n    m = 3\n. The dance \n    [4,\n    \n    2, \n    2, \n    3, 6]\n involves students\nwith levels \n    2\n and \n    2\n, although levels of all dancers must be\npairwise distinct. In the dance \n    [\n    4, 2, 2, \n    3,\n    \n    6]\n students with levels \n    3\n and \n    6\n participate, but\n\n    |3 - 6| = 3\n, although \n    m = 3\n. Help Ira count the number of\nmagnificent dances that she can set. Since this number can be very large,\ncount it modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Two dances are considered different if the\nsets of students participating in them are different. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 number of\ntestcases. The first line of each testcase contains integers \n    n\n and\n\n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of Ira\nstudents and the number of dancers in the magnificent dance. The second line\nof each testcase contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 levels of students. It is guaranteed that the sum\nof \n    n\n over all testcases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach testcase, print a single integer \u2014 the number of magnificent dances.\nSince this number can be very large, print it modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n.
