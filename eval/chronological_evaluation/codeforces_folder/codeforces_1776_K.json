        "description": "In a parallel universe there are \n    n\n chemical elements, numbered from\n\n    1\n to \n    n\n. The element number \n    n\n has not been discovered so far,\nand its discovery would be a pinnacle of research and would bring the person\nwho does it eternal fame and the so-called SWERC prize. There are \n    m\n\nindependent researchers, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    m\n, that are trying to\ndiscover it. Currently, the \n    i\n-th researcher has a sample of the element\n\n    s_i\n. Every year, each researcher independently does one fusion\nexperiment. In a fusion experiment, if the researcher currently has a sample\nof element \n    a\n, they produce a sample of an element \n    b\n that is chosen\nuniformly at random between \n    a+1\n and \n    n\n, and they lose the sample of\nelement \n    a\n. The elements discovered by different researchers or in\ndifferent years are completely independent. The first researcher to discover\nelement \n    n\n will get the SWERC prize. If several researchers discover the\nelement in the same year, they all get the prize. For each \n    i = 1, \n      2,\n    \n     \n    \u2026, \n      m\n, you need to compute the probability that the\n\n    i\n-th researcher wins the prize. Input The first line contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^18\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m\n    \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of elements and the number of researchers. The\nsecond line contains \n    m\n integers \n    s_1, \n      s_2, \n     \n    \u2026, \n     \n    s_m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 s_i < n\n) \u2014 the elements that the researchers currently\nhave. Output Print \n    m\n floating-point numbers. The \n    i\n-th number\nshould be the probability that the \n    i\n-th researcher wins the SWERC prize.\nYour answer is accepted if each number differs from the correct number by at\nmost \n    10^-8\n. Examples Input 2 3 1 1 1 Output 1.0 1.0 1.0 Input 3 3 1 1\n2 Output 0.5 0.5 1.0 Input 3 3 1 1 1 Output 0.625 0.625 0.625 Input 100 7 1 2\n4 8 16 32 64 Output 0.178593469 0.179810455 0.182306771 0.187565366\n0.199300430 0.229356322 0.348722518 Note In the first sample, all researchers\nwill discover element \n    2\n in the first year and win the SWERC prize. In\nthe second sample, the last researcher will definitely discover element\n\n    3\n in the first year and win the SWERC prize. The first two researchers\nhave a \n    50\n    %\n chance of discovering element \n    2\n and a \n    50\n    %\n\nchance of discovering element \n    3\n, and only element \n    3\n will bring\nthem the prize. In the third sample, each researcher has an independent\n\n    50\n    %\n chance of discovering element \n    3\n in the first year, in which\ncase they definitely win the SWERC prize. Additionally, if they all discover\nelement \n    2\n in the first year, which is a \n    12.5\n    %\n chance, then they\nwill all discover element \n    3\n in the second year and all win the prize.\n\n",
