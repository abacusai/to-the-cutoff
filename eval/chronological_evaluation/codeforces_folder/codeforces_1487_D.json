        "description": "A Pythagorean triple is a triple of integer numbers \n    (a, b, c)\n such that\nit is possible to form a right triangle with the lengths of the first\ncathetus, the second cathetus and the hypotenuse equal to \n    a\n, \n    b\n and\n\n    c\n, respectively. An example of the Pythagorean triple is \n    (3, 4,\n    5)\n. Vasya studies the properties of right triangles, and he uses a formula\nthat determines if some triple of integers is Pythagorean. Unfortunately, he\nhas forgotten the exact formula; he remembers only that the formula was some\nequation with squares. So, he came up with the following formula: \n    c = a^2 -\n    b\n. Obviously, this is not the right formula to check if a triple of numbers\nis Pythagorean. But, to Vasya's surprise, it actually worked on the triple\n\n    (3, 4, 5)\n: \n    5 = 3^2 - 4\n, so, according to Vasya's formula, it is a\nPythagorean triple. When Vasya found the right formula (and understood that\nhis formula is wrong), he wondered: how many are there triples of integers\n\n    (a, b, c)\n with \n    1 \n    \u2264 a \n    \u2264 b \n    \u2264 c \n    \u2264 n\n such that they\nare Pythagorean both according to his formula and the real definition? He\nasked you to count these triples. Input The first line contains one integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test\ncase consists of one line containing one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n). Output For each test case, print one integer \u2014 the number of triples\nof integers \n    (a, b, c)\n with \n    1 \n    \u2264 a \n    \u2264 b \n    \u2264 c \n    \u2264 n\n such\nthat they are Pythagorean according both to the real definition and to the\nformula Vasya came up with. Example Input 3 3 6 9 Output 0 1 1 Note The only\nPythagorean triple satisfying \n    c = a^2 - b\n with \n    1 \n    \u2264 a \n    \u2264 b\n    \n    \u2264 c \n    \u2264 9\n is \n    (3, 4, 5)\n; that's why the answer for \n    n = 3\n\nis \n    0\n, and the answer for \n    n = 6\n (and for \n    n = 9\n) is \n    1\n.\n\n",
