        "description": "Let's call the string beautiful if it does not contain a substring of length\nat least \n    2\n, which is a palindrome. Recall that a palindrome is a string\nthat reads the same way from the first character to the last and from the last\ncharacter to the first. For example, the strings a, bab, acca, bcabcbacb are\npalindromes, but the strings ab, abbbaa, cccb are not. Let's define cost of a\nstring as the minimum number of operations so that the string becomes\nbeautiful, if in one operation it is allowed to change any character of the\nstring to one of the first \n    3\n letters of the Latin alphabet (in\nlowercase). You are given a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n, each character\nof the string is one of the first \n    3\n letters of the Latin alphabet (in\nlowercase). You have to answer \n    m\n queries \u2014 calculate the cost of the\nsubstring of the string \n    s\n from \n    l_i\n-th to \n    r_i\n-th position,\ninclusive. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the length of the string \n    s\n\nand the number of queries. The second line contains the string \n    s\n, it\nconsists of \n    n\n characters, each character one of the first \n    3\n Latin\nletters. The following \n    m\n lines contain two integers \n    l_i\n and\n\n    r_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l_i \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 parameters of the \n    i\n-th\nquery. Output For each query, print a single integer \u2014 the cost of the\nsubstring of the string \n    s\n from \n    l_i\n-th to \n    r_i\n-th position,\ninclusive. Example Input 5 4 baacb 1 3 1 5 4 5 2 3 Output 1 2 0 1 Note\nConsider the queries of the example test. in the first query, the substring is\nbaa, which can be changed to bac in one operation; in the second query, the\nsubstring is baacb, which can be changed to cbacb in two operations; in the\nthird query, the substring is cb, which can be left unchanged; in the fourth\nquery, the substring is aa, which can be changed to ba in one operation.\n\n",
