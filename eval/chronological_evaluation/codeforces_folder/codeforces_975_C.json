        "description": "Ivar the Boneless is a great leader. He is trying to capture Kattegat from\nLagertha. The war has begun and wave after wave Ivar's warriors are falling in\nbattle. Ivar has \n    n\n warriors, he places them on a straight line in front\nof the main gate, in a way that the \n    i\n-th warrior stands right after\n\n    (i-1)\n-th warrior. The first warrior leads the attack. Each attacker can\ntake up to \n    a_i\n arrows before he falls to the ground, where \n    a_i\n is\nthe \n    i\n-th warrior's strength. Lagertha orders her warriors to shoot\n\n    k_i\n arrows during the \n    i\n-th minute, the arrows one by one hit the\nfirst still standing warrior. After all Ivar's warriors fall and all the\ncurrently flying arrows fly by, Thor smashes his hammer and all Ivar's\nwarriors get their previous strengths back and stand up to fight again. In\nother words, if all warriors die in minute \n    t\n, they will all be standing\nto fight at the end of minute \n    t\n. The battle will last for \n    q\n\nminutes, after each minute you should tell Ivar what is the number of his\nstanding warriors. Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and\n\n    q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, q \n    \u2264 200\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of warriors and\nthe number of minutes in the battle. The second line contains \n    n\n integers\n\n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) that represent\nthe warriors' strengths. The third line contains \n    q\n integers \n    k_1, k_2,\n    \n    \u2026, k_q\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k_i \n    \u2264 10^14\n), the \n    i\n-th of them\nrepresents Lagertha's order at the \n    i\n-th minute: \n    k_i\n arrows will\nattack the warriors. Output Output \n    q\n lines, the \n    i\n-th of them is\nthe number of standing warriors after the \n    i\n-th minute. Examples Input 5\n5 1 2 1 2 1 3 10 1 1 1 Output 3 5 4 4 3 Input 4 4 1 2 3 4 9 1 10 6 Output 1 4\n4 1 Note In the first example: after the 1-st minute, the 1-st and 2-nd\nwarriors die. after the 2-nd minute all warriors die (and all arrows left over\nare wasted), then they will be revived thus answer is 5 \u2014 all warriors are\nalive. after the 3-rd minute, the 1-st warrior dies. after the 4-th minute,\nthe 2-nd warrior takes a hit and his strength decreases by 1. after the 5-th\nminute, the 2-nd warrior dies.\n\n",
