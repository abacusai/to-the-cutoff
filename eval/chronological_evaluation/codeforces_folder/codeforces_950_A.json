There are l people who play with their\nleft hand, r people, who play with their right hand, and a ambidexters, who\ncan play with left or right hand. The coach decided to form a team of even\nnumber of players, exactly half of the players should play with their right\nhand, and exactly half of the players should play with their left hand. One\nplayer should use only on of his hands. Ambidexters play as well with their\nright hand as with their left hand. In the team, an ambidexter can play with\ntheir left hand, or with their right hand. Please find the maximum possible\nsize of the team, where equal number of players use their left and right\nhands, respectively. Input The only line contains three integers l, r and a (0\n\u2264 l, r, a \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of left-handers, the number of right-handers and\nthe number of ambidexters at the training. Output Print a single even integer\n\u2014 the maximum number of players in the team. It is possible that the team can\nonly have zero number of players. Examples Input 1 4 2 Output 6 Input 5 5 5\nOutput 14 Input 0 2 0 Output 0 Note In the first example you can form a team\nof 6 players. You should take the only left-hander and two ambidexters to play\nwith left hand, and three right-handers to play with right hand. The only\nperson left can't be taken into the team. In the second example you can form a\nteam of 14 people.
