        "description": "You are given a permutation \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n of length \n    n\n of\nnumbers \n    0, \n    \u2026, n - 1\n. Count the number of subsegments \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n of this permutation such that \n    mex(p_l, p_l+1,\n    \n    \u2026, p_r) > med(p_l, p_l+1, \n    \u2026, p_r)\n. \n    mex\n of \n    S\n is\nthe smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in \n    S\n. For example:\n\n    mex(0, 1, 2, 3) = 4\n \n    mex(0, 4, 1, 3) = 2\n \n    mex(5, 4, 0, 1,\n    2) = 3\n\n    med\n of the set \n    S\n is the median of the set, i.e. the\nelement that, after sorting the elements in non-decreasing order, will be at\nposition number \n    \u230a\n    |S| + 1/2\n    \n    \u230b\n (array elements are numbered starting from \n    1\n and here\n\n    \u230av\n    \n    \u230b\n denotes rounding \n    v\n down.).\nFor example: \n    med(0, 1, 2, 3) = 1\n \n    med(0, 4, 1, 3) = 1\n\n\n    med(5, 4, 0, 1, 2) = 2\nA sequence of \n    n\n numbers is called a\npermutation if it contains all the numbers from \n    0\n to \n    n - 1\n exactly\nonce. Input The first line of the input contains a single integer \n    t\n\n\n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n), the number of test cases. The descriptions of\nthe test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single\ninteger \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n), the length of the\npermutation \n    p\n. The second line of each test case contains exactly\n\n    n\n integers: \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n -\n    1\n), elements of permutation \n    p\n. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case print the answer in a single line: the number of subsegments\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n of this permutation such that \n    mex(p_l,\n    p_l+1, \n    \u2026, p_r) > med(p_l, p_l+1, \n    \u2026, p_r)\n.

In the third test\ncase, on the following subsegments: \n    [1, 0]\n, \n    [0]\n, \n    [1, 0, 2]\n\nand \n    [0, 2]\n, \n    mex\n is greater than \n    med\n. In the fourth test\ncase, on the following subsegments: \n    [0, 2]\n, \n    [0]\n, \n    [0, 2, 1]\n\nand \n    [0, 2, 1, 3]\n, \n    mex\n greater than \n    med\n.\n\n",
