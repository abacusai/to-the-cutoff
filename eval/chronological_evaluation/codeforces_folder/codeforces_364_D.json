        "description": "John Doe offered his sister Jane Doe find the gcd of some set of numbers a.\nGcd is a positive integer g, such that all number from the set are evenly\ndivisible by g and there isn't such g' (g' > g), that all numbers of the set\nare evenly divisible by g'. Unfortunately Jane couldn't cope with the task and\nJohn offered her to find the ghd of the same subset of numbers. Ghd is a\npositive integer g, such that at least half of numbers from the set are evenly\ndivisible by g and there isn't such g' (g' > g) that at least half of the\nnumbers from the set are evenly divisible by g'. Jane coped with the task for\ntwo hours. Please try it, too. Input The first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264\nn \u2264 10^6) showing how many numbers are in set a. The second line contains\nspace-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^12). Please note, that\ngiven set can contain equal numbers. Please, do not write the \nto read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the \nspecifier. Output Print a single integer g \u2014 the Ghd of set a. Examples Input\n6 6 2 3 4 5 6 Output 3 Input 5 5 5 6 10 15 Output 5\n\n",
