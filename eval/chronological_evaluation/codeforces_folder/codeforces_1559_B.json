        "description": "As their story unravels, a timeless tale is told once again... Shirahime, a\nfriend of Mocha's, is keen on playing the music game Arcaea and sharing Mocha\ninteresting puzzles to solve. This day, Shirahime comes up with a new simple\npuzzle and wants Mocha to solve them. However, these puzzles are too easy for\nMocha to solve, so she wants you to solve them and tell her the answers. The\npuzzles are described as follow. There are \n    n\n squares arranged in a row,\nand each of them can be painted either red or blue. Among these squares, some\nof them have been painted already, and the others are blank. You can decide\nwhich color to paint on each blank square. Some pairs of adjacent squares may\nhave the same color, which is imperfect. We define the imperfectness as the\nnumber of pairs of adjacent squares that share the same color. For example,\nthe imperfectness of \"BRRRBBR\" is \n    3\n, with \"BB\" occurred once and \"RR\"\noccurred twice. Your goal is to minimize the imperfectness and print out the\ncolors of the squares after painting. Input Each test contains multiple test\ncases. The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The\nfirst line of each test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \u2264 n\n    \u2264\n    100\n) \u2014 the length of the squares row. The second line of each test case\ncontains a string \n    s\n with length \n    n\n, containing characters 'B', 'R'\nand '?'. Here 'B' stands for a blue square, 'R' for a red square, and '?' for\na blank square. Output For each test case, print a line with a string only\ncontaining 'B' and 'R', the colors of the squares after painting, which\nimperfectness is minimized. If there are multiple solutions, print any of\nthem. Example Input 5 7 ?R???BR 7 ???R??? 1 ? 1 B 10 ?R??RB??B? Output BRRBRBR\nBRBRBRB B B BRRBRBBRBR Note In the first test case, if the squares are painted\n\"BRRBRBR\", the imperfectness is \n    1\n (since squares \n    2\n and \n    3\n\nhave the same color), which is the minimum possible imperfectness.\n\n",
