        "description": "Nick likes strings very much, he likes to rotate them, sort them, rearrange\ncharacters within a string... Once he wrote a random string of characters a,\nb, c on a piece of paper and began to perform the following operations: to\ntake two adjacent characters and replace the second character with the first\none, to take two adjacent characters and replace the first character with the\nsecond one To understand these actions better, let's take a look at a string\n\u00ababc\u00bb. All of the following strings can be obtained by performing one of the\ndescribed operations on \u00ababc\u00bb: \u00abbbc\u00bb, \u00ababb\u00bb, \u00abacc\u00bb. Let's denote the frequency\nof a character for each of the characters a, b and c as the number of\noccurrences of this character in the string. For example, for string \u00ababc\u00bb:\n|a| = 1, |b| = 1, |c| = 1, and for string \u00abbbc\u00bb: |a| = 0, |b| = 2, |c| = 1.\nWhile performing the described operations, Nick sometimes got balanced\nstrings. Let's say that a string is balanced, if the frequencies of each\ncharacter differ by at most 1. That is - 1 \u2264 |a| - |b| \u2264 1, - 1 \u2264 |a| - |c| \u2264\n1 \u0438 - 1 \u2264 |b| - |c| \u2264 1. Would you help Nick find the number of different\nbalanced strings that can be obtained by performing the operations described\nabove, perhaps multiple times, on the given string s. This number should be\ncalculated modulo 51123987. Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n150) \u2014 the length of the given string s. Next line contains the given string\ns. The initial string can be balanced as well, in this case it should be\ncounted too. The given string s consists only of characters a, b and c. Output\nOutput the only number \u2014 the number of different balanced strings that can be\nobtained by performing the described operations, perhaps multiple times, on\nthe given string s, modulo 51123987. Examples Input 4 abca Output 7 Input 4\nabbc Output 3 Input 2 ab Output 1 Note In the first sample it is possible to\nget 51 different strings through the described operations, but only 7 of them\nare balanced: \u00ababca\u00bb, \u00abbbca\u00bb, \u00abbcca\u00bb, \u00abbcaa\u00bb, \u00ababcc\u00bb, \u00ababbc\u00bb, \u00abaabc\u00bb. In the\nsecond sample: \u00ababbc\u00bb, \u00abaabc\u00bb, \u00ababcc\u00bb. In the third sample there is only one\nbalanced string \u2014 \u00abab\u00bb itself.\n\n",
