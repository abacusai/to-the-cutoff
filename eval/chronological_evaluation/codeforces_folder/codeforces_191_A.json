        "description": "The ancient Berlanders believed that the longer the name, the more important\nits bearer is. Thus, Berland kings were famous for their long names. But long\nnames are somewhat inconvenient, so the Berlanders started to abbreviate the\nnames of their kings. They called every king by the first letters of its name.\nThus, the king, whose name was Victorious Vasily Pupkin, was always called by\nthe berlanders VVP. In Berland over its long history many dynasties of kings\nreplaced each other, but they were all united by common traditions. Thus,\naccording to one Berland traditions, to maintain stability in the country, the\nfirst name of the heir should be the same as the last name his predecessor\n(hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the heir coincides with\nthe last letter of the abbreviated name of the predecessor). Berlanders\nappreciate stability, so this tradition has never been broken. Also Berlanders\nlike perfection, so another tradition requires that the first name of the\nfirst king in the dynasty coincides with the last name of the last king in\nthis dynasty (hence, the first letter of the abbreviated name of the first\nking coincides with the last letter of the abbreviated name of the last king).\nThis tradition, of course, has also been always observed. The name of a\ndynasty is formed by very simple rules: we take all the short names of the\nkings in the order in which they ruled, and write them in one line. Thus, a\ndynasty of kings \"ab\" and \"ba\" is called \"abba\", and the dynasty, which had\nonly the king \"abca\", is called \"abca\". Vasya, a historian, has recently found\na list of abbreviated names of all Berland kings and their relatives. Help\nVasya to find the maximally long name of the dynasty that could have existed\nin Berland. Note that in his list all the names are ordered by the time, that\nis, if name A is earlier in the list than B, then if A and B were kings, then\nking A ruled before king B. Input The first line contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n5\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of names in Vasya's list. Next n lines contain n\nabbreviated names, one per line. An abbreviated name is a non-empty sequence\nof lowercase Latin letters. Its length does not exceed 10 characters. Output\nPrint a single number \u2014 length of the sought dynasty's name in letters. If\nVasya's list is wrong and no dynasty can be found there, print a single number\n0. Examples Input 3 abc ca cba Output 6 Input 4 vvp vvp dam vvp Output 0 Input\n3 ab c def Output 1 Note In the first sample two dynasties can exist: the one\ncalled \"abcca\" (with the first and second kings) and the one called \"abccba\"\n(with the first and third kings). In the second sample there aren't acceptable\ndynasties. The only dynasty in the third sample consists of one king, his name\nis \"c\".\n\n",
