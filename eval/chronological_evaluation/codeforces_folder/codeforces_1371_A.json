        "description": "A penguin Rocher has \n    n\n sticks. He has exactly one stick with length\n\n    i\n for all \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n. He can connect some sticks. If he\nconnects two sticks that have lengths \n    a\n and \n    b\n, he gets one stick\nwith length \n    a + b\n. Two sticks, that were used in the operation disappear\nfrom his set and the new connected stick appears in his set and can be used\nfor the next connections. He wants to create the maximum number of sticks that\nhave the same length. It is not necessary to make all sticks have the same\nlength, some sticks can have the other length. How many sticks with the equal\nlength he can create? Input The input consists of multiple test cases. The\nfirst line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Next \n    t\n lines contain descriptions of test\ncases. For each test case, the only line contains a single integer \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n). Output For each test case, print a single\ninteger \u2014 the answer to the problem. Example Input 4 1 2 3 4 Output 1 1 2 2\nNote In the third case, he can connect two sticks with lengths \n    1\n and\n\n    2\n and he will get one stick with length \n    3\n. So, he will have two\nsticks with lengths \n    3\n. In the fourth case, he can connect two sticks\nwith lengths \n    1\n and \n    3\n and he will get one stick with length\n\n    4\n. After that, he will have three sticks with lengths \n    2, 4,\n    4\n, so two sticks have the same length, and one stick has the other\nlength.\n\n",
