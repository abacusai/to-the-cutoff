        "description": "You have a directed acyclic graph G, consisting of n vertexes, numbered from 0\nto n - 1. The graph contains n edges numbered from 0 to n - 1. An edge with\nnumber i connects vertexes i and (i + 1) mod n, and it can be directed in\neither direction (from i to (i + 1) mod n, or vise versa). Operation x mod y\nmeans taking the remainder after dividing number x by number y. Let's call two\nvertexes u and v in graph G comparable if the graph contains a path either\nfrom u to v or from v to u. We'll assume that an antichain is a set of\nvertexes of graph G, where any two distinct vertexes are not comparable. The\nsize of an antichain is the number of vertexes in the corresponding set. An\nantichain is maximum if the graph doesn't have antichains of a larger size.\nYour task is to find the size of the maximum antichain in graph G. Input The\nfirst line contains the sequence of characters s0s1... sn - 1 (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^6),\nconsisting of numbers zero and one. The length of the line (number n)\ncorresponds to the number of vertexes and edges in graph G. If character si (i\n\u2265 0) equals 0, then the edge between vertexes i and (i + 1) mod n is directed\nfrom the i-th vertex to the (i + 1) mod n-th one, otherwise \u2014 to the opposite\npoint. It is guaranteed that the given graph is acyclic. Output Print a single\ninteger \u2014 the size of the maximum antichain of graph G. Examples Input 001\nOutput 1 Input 110010 Output 3 Note Consider the first test sample. The\ngraph's G edges are: 0 \u2192 1, 1 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 2. We can choose the set of vertexes\n[0] as the maximum antichain. We cannot choose an antichain of larger size.\n\n",
