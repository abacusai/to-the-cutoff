        "description": "You are given an array \n    a\n consisting of \n    n\n integers (it is\nguaranteed that \n    n\n is even, i.e. divisible by \n    2\n). All \n    a_i\n\ndoes not exceed some integer \n    k\n. Your task is to replace the minimum\nnumber of elements (replacement is the following operation: choose some index\n\n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n\n and replace \n    a_i\n with some integer in\nrange \n    [1; k]\n) to satisfy the following conditions: after all\nreplacements, all \n    a_i\n are positive integers not greater than \n    k\n;\nfor all \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n/2\n the following equation is\ntrue: \n    a_i + a_n - i + 1 = x\n, where \n    x\n should be the same for all\n\n    n/2\n pairs of elements. You have to answer \n    t\n independent\ntest cases. Input The first line of the input contains one integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test\ncases follow. The first line of the test case contains two integers \n    n\n\nand \n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5, 1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the length of \n    a\n and the maximum possible value of some\n\n    a_i\n correspondingly. It is guratanteed that \n    n\n is even (i.e.\ndivisible by \n    2\n). The second line of the test case contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 k\n), where\n\n    a_i\n is the \n    i\n-th element of \n    a\n. It is guaranteed that the sum\nof \n    n\n (as well as the sum of \n    k\n) over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n (\n    \u2211 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n, \n    \u2211 k \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). Output For each test case, print the answer \u2014 the minimum\nnumber of elements you have to replace in \n    a\n to satisfy the conditions\nfrom the problem statement.
