        "name": "Three Garlands",
        "description": "Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of\nthem will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.\nWhen a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state \u2014 sometimes\nit is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th\nsecond, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + ki, x + 2ki, x + 3ki and so\non. Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each\nsecond after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit\ngarland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x1, x2 and x3 (not\nnecessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x1-th\nsecond, the second one \u2014 during x2-th second, and the third one \u2014 during x3-th\nsecond, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x1, x2, x3) at\nleast one garland will be lit. Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to\ndo this! Input The first line contains three integers k1, k2 and k3 (1 \u2264 ki \u2264\n1500) \u2014 time intervals of the garlands. Output If Mishka can choose moments of\ntime to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching\nthe garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES. Otherwise, print\nNO. Examples Input 2 2 3 Output YES Input 4 2 3 Output NO Note In the first\nexample Mishka can choose x1 = 1, x2 = 2, x3 = 1. The first garland will be\nlit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second \u2014 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which\nalready cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what\nx3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10,\n..., though. In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of\ntime, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.\n\n",
