        "description": "Stephen Queen wants to write a story. He is a very unusual writer, he uses\nonly letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' and 'e'! To compose a story, Stephen wrote out\n\n    n\n words consisting of the first \n    5\n lowercase letters of the Latin\nalphabet. He wants to select the maximum number of words to make an\ninteresting story. Let a story be a sequence of words that are not necessarily\ndifferent. A story is called interesting if there exists a letter which occurs\namong all words of the story more times than all other letters together. For\nexample, the story consisting of three words \"bac\", \"aaada\", \"e\" is\ninteresting (the letter 'a' occurs \n    5\n times, all other letters occur\n\n    4\n times in total). But the story consisting of two words \"aba\", \"abcde\"\nis not (no such letter that it occurs more than all other letters in total).\nYou are given a sequence of \n    n\n words consisting of letters 'a', 'b', 'c',\n'd' and 'e'. Your task is to choose the maximum number of them to make an\ninteresting story. If there's no way to make a non-empty story, output\n\n    0\n. Input The first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    5000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then \n    t\n test cases follow. The first\nline of each test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of the words in the sequence. Then \n    n\n lines\nfollow, each of them contains a word \u2014 a non-empty string consisting of\nlowercase letters of the Latin alphabet. The words in the sequence may be non-\ndistinct (i. e. duplicates are allowed). Only the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'\nand 'e' may occur in the words. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over\nall test cases doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n; the sum of the lengths of\nall words over all test cases doesn't exceed \n    4 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case, output the maximum number of words that compose an interesting\nstory. Print 0 if there's no way to make a non-empty interesting story.\nExample Input 6 3 bac aaada e 3 aba abcde aba 2 baba baba 4 ab ab c bc 5 cbdca\nd a d e 3 b c ca Output 3 2 0 2 3 2 Note In the first test case of the\nexample, all \n    3\n words can be used to make an interesting story. The\ninteresting story is \"bac aaada e\". In the second test case of the example,\nthe \n    1\n-st and the \n    3\n-rd words can be used to make an interesting\nstory. The interesting story is \"aba aba\". Stephen can't use all three words\nat the same time. In the third test case of the example, Stephen can't make a\nnon-empty interesting story. So the answer is \n    0\n. In the fourth test case\nof the example, Stephen can use the \n    3\n-rd and the \n    4\n-th words to\nmake an interesting story. The interesting story is \"c bc\".\n\n",
