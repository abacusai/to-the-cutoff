        "description": "There is a field divided into \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n columns. Some cells are\nempty (denoted as E), other cells contain robots (denoted as R). You can send\na command to all robots at the same time. The command can be of one of the\nfour types: move up; move right; move down; move left. When you send a\ncommand, all robots at the same time attempt to take one step in the direction\nyou picked. If a robot tries to move outside the field, it explodes;\notherwise, every robot moves to an adjacent cell in the chosen direction. You\ncan send as many commands as you want (possibly, zero), in any order. Your\ngoal is to make at least one robot reach the upper left corner of the field.\nCan you do this without forcing any of the robots to explode? Input The first\nline contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers \n    n\n\nand \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 5\n) \u2014 the number of rows and the number\nof columns, respectively. Then \n    n\n lines follow; each of them contains a\nstring of \n    m\n characters. Each character is either E (empty cell or R\n(robot). Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, there is at\nleast one robot on the field. Output If it is possible to make at least one\nrobot reach the upper left corner of the field so that no robot explodes,\nprint YES. Otherwise, print NO. Example Input 6 1 3 ERR 2 2 ER RE 2 2 ER ER 1\n1 R 4 3 EEE EEE ERR EER 3 3 EEE EER REE Output YES NO YES YES YES NO Note\nExplanations for test cases of the example: in the first test case, it is\nenough to send a command to move left. in the second test case, if you try to\nsend any command, at least one robot explodes. in the third test case, it is\nenough to send a command to move left. in the fourth test case, there is\nalready a robot in the upper left corner. in the fifth test case, the sequence\n\"move up, move left, move up\" leads one robot to the upper left corner; in the\nsixth test case, if you try to move any robot to the upper left corner, at\nleast one other robot explodes.\n\n",
