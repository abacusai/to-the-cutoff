        "description": "You are given \n    n\n rectangles, each of height \n    1\n. Each rectangle's\nwidth is a power of \n    2\n (i. e. it can be represented as \n    2^x\n for some\nnon-negative integer \n    x\n). You are also given a two-dimensional box of\nwidth \n    W\n. Note that \n    W\n may or may not be a power of \n    2\n.\nMoreover, \n    W\n is at least as large as the width of the largest rectangle.\nYou have to find the smallest height of this box, such that it is able to fit\nall the given rectangles. It is allowed to have some empty space left in this\nbox after fitting all the rectangles. You cannot rotate the given rectangles\nto make them fit into the box. Moreover, any two distinct rectangles must not\noverlap, i. e., any two distinct rectangles must have zero intersection area.\nSee notes for visual explanation of sample input. Input The first line of\ninput contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^3\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. For each test\ncase: the first line contains two integers \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264\n    10^5\n) and \n    W\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 W \n    \u2264 10^9\n); the second line contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    w_1, w_2, \n    \u2026, w_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 w_i \n    \u2264 10^6\n),\nwhere \n    w_i\n is the width of the \n    i\n-th rectangle. Each \n    w_i\n is a\npower of \n    2\n; additionally, \n    max\n    _i=1^n w_i \n    \u2264 W\n.\nThe sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output\nOutput \n    t\n integers. The \n    i\n-th integer should be equal to the answer\nto the \n    i\n-th test case \u2014 the smallest height of the box. Example Input 2\n5 16 1 2 8 4 8 6 10 2 8 8 2 2 8 Output 2 3 Note For the first test case in the\nsample input, the following figure shows one way to fit the given five\nrectangles into the 2D box with minimum height: In the figure above, the\nnumber inside each rectangle is its width. The width of the 2D box is \n    16\n\n(indicated with arrow below). The minimum height required for the 2D box in\nthis case is \n    2\n (indicated on the left). In the second test case, you can\nhave a minimum height of three by keeping two blocks (one each of widths eight\nand two) on each of the three levels.\n\n",
