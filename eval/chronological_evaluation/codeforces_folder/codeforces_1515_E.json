        "name": "Phoenix and Computers",
        "description": "There are \n    n\n computers in a row, all originally off, and Phoenix wants to\nturn all of them on. He will manually turn on computers one at a time. At any\npoint, if computer \n    i-1\n and computer \n    i+1\n are both on, computer\n\n    i\n \n    (2 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n-1)\n will turn on automatically if it is not\nalready on. Note that Phoenix cannot manually turn on a computer that already\nturned on automatically. If we only consider the sequence of computers that\nPhoenix turns on manually, how many ways can he turn on all the computers? Two\nsequences are distinct if either the set of computers turned on manually is\ndistinct, or the order of computers turned on manually is distinct. Since this\nnumber may be large, please print it modulo \n    M\n. Input The first line\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    M\n (\n    3 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 400\n; \n    10^8\n    \n    \u2264 M \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of computers and the modulo. It is\nguaranteed that \n    M\n is prime. Output Print one integer \u2014 the number of\nways to turn on the computers modulo \n    M\n. Examples Input 3 100000007\nOutput 6 Input 4 100000007 Output 20 Input 400 234567899 Output 20914007 Note\nIn the first example, these are the \n    6\n orders in which Phoenix can turn\non all computers: \n    [1,3]\n. Turn on computer \n    1\n, then \n    3\n. Note\nthat computer \n    2\n turns on automatically after computer \n    3\n is turned\non manually, but we only consider the sequence of computers that are turned on\nmanually. \n    [3,1]\n. Turn on computer \n    3\n, then \n    1\n. \n    [1,2,3]\n.\nTurn on computer \n    1\n, \n    2\n, then \n    3\n. \n    [2,1,3]\n \n    [2,3,1]\n\n\n    [3,2,1]\n\n\n",
