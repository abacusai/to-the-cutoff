        "name": "Three Trees",
        "description": "This problem consists of two subproblems: for solving subproblem E1 you will\nreceive 11 points, and for solving subproblem E2 you will receive 13 points. A\ntree is an undirected connected graph containing no cycles. The distance\nbetween two nodes in an unweighted tree is the minimum number of edges that\nhave to be traversed to get from one node to another. You are given 3 trees\nthat have to be united into a single tree by adding two edges between these\ntrees. Each of these edges can connect any pair of nodes from two trees. After\nthe trees are connected, the distances between all unordered pairs of nodes in\nthe united tree should be computed. What is the maximum possible value of the\nsum of these distances? Input The first line contains three space-separated\nintegers n1, n2, n3 \u2014 the number of vertices in the first, second, and third\ntrees, respectively. The following n1 - 1 lines describe the first tree. Each\nof these lines describes an edge in the first tree and contains a pair of\nintegers separated by a single space \u2014 the numeric labels of vertices\nconnected by the edge. The following n2 - 1 lines describe the second tree in\nthe same fashion, and the n3 - 1 lines after that similarly describe the third\ntree. The vertices in each tree are numbered with consecutive integers\nstarting with 1. The problem consists of two subproblems. The subproblems have\ndifferent constraints on the input. You will get some score for the correct\nsubmission of the subproblem. The description of the subproblems follows. In\nsubproblem E1 (11 points), the number of vertices in each tree will be between\n1 and 1000, inclusive. In subproblem E2 (13 points), the number of vertices in\neach tree will be between 1 and 100000, inclusive. Output Print a single\ninteger number \u2014 the maximum possible sum of distances between all pairs of\nnodes in the united tree. Examples Input 2 2 3 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 3 Output 56 Input\n5 1 4 1 2 2 5 3 4 4 2 1 2 1 3 1 4 Output 151 Note Consider the first test\ncase. There are two trees composed of two nodes, and one tree with three\nnodes. The maximum possible answer is obtained if the trees are connected in a\nsingle chain of 7 vertices. In the second test case, a possible choice of new\nedges to obtain the maximum answer is the following: Connect node 3 from the\nfirst tree to node 1 from the second tree; Connect node 2 from the third tree\nto node 1 from the second tree.\n\n",
