        "name": "Martian Food",
        "description": "Have you ever tasted Martian food? Well, you should. Their signature dish is\nserved on a completely black plate with the radius of R, flat as a pancake.\nFirst, they put a perfectly circular portion of the Golden Honduras on the\nplate. It has the radius of r and is located as close to the edge of the plate\nas possible staying entirely within the plate. I. e. Golden Honduras touches\nthe edge of the plate from the inside. It is believed that the proximity of\nthe portion of the Golden Honduras to the edge of a plate demonstrates the\nneatness and exactness of the Martians. Then a perfectly round portion of Pink\nGuadeloupe is put on the plate. The Guadeloupe should not overlap with\nHonduras, should not go beyond the border of the plate, but should have the\nmaximum radius. I. e. Pink Guadeloupe should touch the edge of the plate from\nthe inside, and touch Golden Honduras from the outside. For it is the size of\nthe Rose Guadeloupe that shows the generosity and the hospitality of the\nMartians. Further, the first portion (of the same perfectly round shape) of\nGreen Bull Terrier is put on the plate. It should come in contact with\nHonduras and Guadeloupe, should not go beyond the border of the plate and\nshould have maximum radius. Each of the following portions of the Green Bull\nTerrier must necessarily touch the Golden Honduras, the previous portion of\nthe Green Bull Terrier and touch the edge of a plate, but should not go beyond\nthe border. To determine whether a stranger is worthy to touch the food, the\nMartians ask him to find the radius of the k-th portion of the Green Bull\nTerrier knowing the radii of a plate and a portion of the Golden Honduras. And\nare you worthy? Input The first line contains integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014\namount of testcases. Each of the following t lines contain three positive\nintegers: the radii of the plate and a portion of the Golden Honduras R and r\n(1 \u2264 r < R \u2264 10^4) and the number k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^4). In the pretests 1 \u2264 k \u2264 2.\nOutput Print t lines \u2014 the radius of the k-th portion of the Green Bull\nTerrier for each test. The absolute or relative error of the answer should not\nexceed 10^-6. Examples Input 2 4 3 1 4 2 2 Output 0.9230769231 0.6666666667\nNote Dish from the first sample looks like this: Dish from the second sample\nlooks like this:\n\n",
