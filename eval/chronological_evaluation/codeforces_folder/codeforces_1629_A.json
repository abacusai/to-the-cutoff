        "description": "Did you know you can download more RAM? There is a shop with \n    n\n different\npieces of software that increase your RAM. The \n    i\n-th RAM increasing\nsoftware takes \n    a_i\n GB of memory to run (temporarily, once the program is\ndone running, you get the RAM back), and gives you an additional \n    b_i\n GB\nof RAM (permanently). Each software can only be used once. Your PC currently\nhas \n    k\n GB of RAM. Note that you can't use a RAM-increasing software if it\ntakes more GB of RAM to use than what you currently have. Since RAM is the\nmost important thing in the world, you wonder, what is the maximum possible\namount of RAM achievable? Input The first line of the input contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains\nthe integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k\n    \n    \u2264 1000\n). Then two lines follow, each containing \n    n\n integers\ndescribing the arrays \n    a\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264 1000\n).\nOutput For each test case, output a single line containing the largest amount\nof RAM you can achieve. Example Input 4 3 10 20 30 10 9 100 10 5 1 1 1 5 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 5 1 2 2 2 2 2 100 100 100 100 100 5 8 128 64 32 16 8 128 64 32 16 8\nOutput 29 6 1 256 Note In the first test case, you only have enough RAM to run\nthe third software initially, but that increases your RAM to \n    20\n GB,\nwhich allows you to use the first software, increasing your RAM to \n    29\n\nGB. The only software left needs \n    30\n GB of RAM, so you have to stop here.\nIn the second test case, you can use the first, second, fourth and fifth\nsoftware that need only \n    1\n GB of RAM per software to run to increase your\nRAM to \n    5\n GB, and then use the last remaining one to increase your RAM to\n\n    6\n GB. In the third test case, all the software need more than \n    1\n GB\nof RAM to run, so the amount of RAM you have stays at \n    1\n GB.\n\n",
