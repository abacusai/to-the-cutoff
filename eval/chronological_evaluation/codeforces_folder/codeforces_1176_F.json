        "description": "You are playing a computer card game called Splay the Sire. Currently you are\nstruggling to defeat the final boss of the game. The boss battle consists of\n\n    n\n turns. During each turn, you will get several cards. Each card has two\nparameters: its cost \n    c_i\n and damage \n    d_i\n. You may play some of your\ncards during each turn in some sequence (you choose the cards and the exact\norder they are played), as long as the total cost of the cards you play during\nthe turn does not exceed \n    3\n. After playing some (possibly zero) cards,\nyou end your turn, and all cards you didn't play are discarded. Note that you\ncan use each card at most once. Your character has also found an artifact that\nboosts the damage of some of your actions: every \n    10\n-th card you play\ndeals double damage. What is the maximum possible damage you can deal during\n\n    n\n turns? Input The first line contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of turns. Then \n    n\n blocks of input\nfollow, the \n    i\n-th block representing the cards you get during the\n\n    i\n-th turn. Each block begins with a line containing one integer\n\n    k_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of cards you\nget during \n    i\n-th turn. Then \n    k_i\n lines follow, each containing two\nintegers \n    c_j\n and \n    d_j\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_j \n    \u2264 3\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 d_j\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the parameters of the corresponding card. It is guaranteed\nthat \n    \u2211\n    _i = 1^n k_i \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output Print\none integer \u2014 the maximum damage you may deal. Example Input 5 3 1 6 1 7 1 5 2\n1 4 1 3 3 1 10 3 5 2 3 3 1 15 2 4 1 10 1 1 100 Output 263 Note In the example\ntest the best course of action is as follows: During the first turn, play all\nthree cards in any order and deal \n    18\n damage. During the second turn,\nplay both cards and deal \n    7\n damage. During the third turn, play the first\nand the third card and deal \n    13\n damage. During the fourth turn, play the\nfirst and the third card and deal \n    25\n damage. During the fifth turn, play\nthe only card, which will deal double damage (\n    200\n).\n\n",
