        "description": "This night wasn't easy on Vasya. His favorite team lost, and he didn't find\nhimself victorious either \u2014 although he played perfectly, his teammates let\nhim down every time. He had to win at least one more time, but the losestreak\nonly grew longer and longer... It's no wonder he didn't get any sleep this\nnight at all. In the morning, Vasya was waiting the bus to the university on\nthe bus stop. Vasya's thoughts were hazy and so he couldn't remember the right\nbus' number quite right and got onto the bus with the number \n    n\n. In the\nbus, Vasya thought that he could get the order of the digits in the number of\nthe bus wrong. Futhermore, he could \"see\" some digits several times, but the\ndigits he saw were definitely in the real number of the bus. For example, if\nVasya saw the number 2028, it could mean that the real bus number could be\n2028, 8022, 2820 or just 820. However, numbers 80, 22208, 52 definitely\ncouldn't be the number of the bus. Also, real bus number couldn't start with\nthe digit 0, this meaning that, for example, number 082 couldn't be the real\nbus number too. Given \n    n\n, determine the total number of possible bus\nnumber variants. Input The first line contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^18\n) \u2014 the number of the bus that was seen by Vasya. It\nis guaranteed that this number does not start with \n    0\n. Output Output a\nsingle integer \u2014 the amount of possible variants of the real bus number.\nExamples Input 97 Output 2 Input 2028 Output 13 Note In the first sample, only\nvariants \n    97\n and \n    79\n are possible. In the second sample, the\nvariants (in the increasing order) are the following: \n    208\n, \n    280\n,\n\n    802\n, \n    820\n, \n    2028\n, \n    2082\n, \n    2208\n, \n    2280\n,\n\n    2802\n, \n    2820\n, \n    8022\n, \n    8202\n, \n    8220\n.\n\n",
