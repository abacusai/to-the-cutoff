        "description": "One day, BThero decided to play around with arrays and came up with the\nfollowing problem: You are given an array \n    a\n, which consists of \n    n\n\npositive integers. The array is numerated \n    1\n through \n    n\n. You execute\nthe following procedure exactly once: You create a new array \n    b\n which\nconsists of \n    2n\n positive integers, where for each \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n\nthe condition \n    b_2i-1+b_2i = a_i\n holds. For example, for the array\n\n    a = [6, 8, 2]\n you can create \n    b = [2, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1]\n. You merge\nconsecutive equal numbers in \n    b\n. For example, \n    b = [2, 4, 4, 4, 1,\n    1]\n becomes \n    b = [2, 4, 1]\n. Find and print the minimum possible value\nof \n    |b|\n (size of \n    b\n) which can be achieved at the end of the\nprocedure. It can be shown that under the given constraints there is at least\none way to construct \n    b\n. Input The first line of the input file contains\na single integer \n    T\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) denoting the\nnumber of test cases. The description of \n    T\n test cases follows. The first\nline of each test contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n). The second line contains \n    n\n space-separated integers\n\n    a_1\n, \n    a_2\n, ..., \n    a_n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is\nguaranteed that \n    \u2211n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    5\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, print a single line containing one\ninteger \u2014 the minimum possible value of \n    |b|\n. Example Input 3 3 6 8 2 1 4\n3 5 6 6 Output 3 1 2\n\n",
