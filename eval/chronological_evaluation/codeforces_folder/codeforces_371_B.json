        "description": "Two little greedy bears have found two pieces of cheese in the forest of\nweight a and b grams, correspondingly. The bears are so greedy that they are\nready to fight for the larger piece. That's where the fox comes in and starts\nthe dialog: \"Little bears, wait a little, I want to make your pieces equal\"\n\"Come off it fox, how are you going to do that?\", the curious bears asked.\n\"It's easy\", said the fox. \"If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by\ntwo, then I can eat exactly a half of the piece. If the mass of a certain\npiece is divisible by three, then I can eat exactly two-thirds, and if the\nmass is divisible by five, then I can eat four-fifths. I'll eat a little here\nand there and make the pieces equal\". The little bears realize that the fox's\nproposal contains a catch. But at the same time they realize that they can not\nmake the two pieces equal themselves. So they agreed to her proposal, but on\none condition: the fox should make the pieces equal as quickly as possible.\nFind the minimum number of operations the fox needs to make pieces equal.\nInput The first line contains two space-separated integers a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264\n10^9). Output If the fox is lying to the little bears and it is impossible to\nmake the pieces equal, print -1. Otherwise, print the required minimum number\nof operations. If the pieces of the cheese are initially equal, the required\nnumber is 0. Examples Input 15 20 Output 3 Input 14 8 Output -1 Input 6 6\nOutput 0\n\n",
