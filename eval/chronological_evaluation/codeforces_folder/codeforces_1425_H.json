        "description": "Chaneka has a hobby of playing with animal toys. Every toy has a different fun\nvalue, a real number. Chaneka has four boxes to store the toys with\nspecification: The first box stores toys with fun values in range of\n\n    (-\n    \u221e,-1]\n. The second box stores toys with fun values in range of\n\n    (-1, 0)\n. The third box stores toys with fun values in range of \n    (0,\n    1)\n. The fourth box stores toys with fun value in range of \n    [1,\n    \n    \u221e)\n. Chaneka has \n    A\n, \n    B\n, \n    C\n, \n    D\n toys in the\nfirst, second, third, and fourth box, respectively. One day she decides that\nshe only wants one toy, a super toy. So she begins to create this super toy by\nsewing all the toys she has. While the number of toys Chaneka has is more than\n1, she takes two different toys randomly and then sews them together, creating\na new toy. The fun value of this new toy is equal to the multiplication of fun\nvalues of the sewn toys. She then puts this new toy in the appropriate box.\nShe repeats this process until she only has one toy. This last toy is the\nsuper toy, and the box that stores this toy is the special box. As an\nobserver, you only know the number of toys in each box initially but do not\nknow their fun values. You also don't see the sequence of Chaneka's sewing.\nDetermine which boxes can be the special box after Chaneka found her super\ntoy. Input The first line has an integer \n    T\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7\n    10^4)\n, the number of test cases. Every case contains a line with four\nspace-separated integers \n    A\n \n    B\n \n    C\n \n    D\n \n    (0 \n    \u2264 A, B, C,\n    D \n    \u2264 10^6, A + B + C + D > 0)\n, which denotes the number of toys in the\nfirst, second, third, and fourth box, respectively. Output For each case,\nprint four space-separated strings. Each string represents the possibility\nthat the first, second, third, and fourth box can be the special box from left\nto right. For each box, print \"Ya\" (Without quotes, Indonesian for yes) if\nthat box can be the special box. Print \"Tidak\" (Without quotes, Indonesian for\nNo) otherwise. Example Input 2 1 2 0 1 0 1 0 0 Output Ya Ya Tidak Tidak Tidak\nYa Tidak Tidak Note For the first case, here is a scenario where the first box\nis the special box: The first box had toys with fun values \n    -3\n.\nThe second box had toys with fun values \n    -0.5, -0.5\n The\nfourth box had toys with fun values \n    3\n The sewing sequence:\nChaneka sews the toy with fun \n    -0.5\n and \n    -0.5\n to a toy with fun\n\n    0.25\n and then put it in the third box. Chaneka sews the toy with fun\n\n    -3\n and \n    0.25\n to a toy with fun \n    -0.75\n and then put it in the\nsecond box. Chaneka sews the toy with fun \n    -0.75\n and \n    3\n to a toy\nwith fun \n    -1.25\n and then put it in the first box, which then became the\nspecial box. Here is a scenario where the second box ends up being the special\nbox: The first box had toys with fun values \n    -3\n The second box\nhad toys with fun values \n    -0.33, -0.25\n. The fourth box had\ntoys with fun values \n    3\n. The sewing sequence: Chaneka sews\nthe toy with fun \n    -3\n and \n    -0.33\n to a toy with fun \n    0.99\n and\nthen put it in the third box. Chaneka sews the toy with fun \n    0.99\n and\n\n    3\n to a toy with fun \n    2.97\n and then put in it the fourth box.\nChaneka sews the toy with fun \n    2.97\n and \n    -0.25\n to a toy with fun\n\n    -0.7425\n and then put it in the second box, which then became the special\nbox. There is only one toy for the second case, so Chaneka does not have to\nsew anything because that toy, by definition, is the super toy.\n\n",
