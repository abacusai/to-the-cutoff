        "description": "Today in the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland, there was a biology\nlesson. The topic of the lesson was the genomes. Let's call the genome the\nstring \"ACTG\". Maxim was very boring to sit in class, so the teacher came up\nwith a task for him: on a given string \n    s\n consisting of uppercase letters\nand length of at least \n    4\n, you need to find the minimum number of\noperations that you need to apply, so that the genome appears in it as a\nsubstring. For one operation, you can replace any letter in the string \n    s\n\nwith the next or previous in the alphabet. For example, for the letter \"D\" the\nprevious one will be \"C\", and the next \u2014 \"E\". In this problem, we assume that\nfor the letter \"A\", the previous one will be the letter \"Z\", and the next one\nwill be \"B\", and for the letter \"Z\", the previous one is the letter \"Y\", and\nthe next one is the letter \"A\". Help Maxim solve the problem that the teacher\ngave him. A string \n    a\n is a substring of a string \n    b\n if \n    a\n can\nbe obtained from \n    b\n by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all)\ncharacters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters\nfrom the end. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    4\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the length of the string \n    s\n. The second line\ncontains the string \n    s\n, consisting of exactly \n    n\n uppercase letters\nof the Latin alphabet. Output Output the minimum number of operations that\nneed to be applied to the string \n    s\n so that the genome appears as a\nsubstring in it. Examples Input 4 ZCTH Output 2 Input 5 ZDATG Output 5 Input 6\nAFBAKC Output 16 Note In the first example, you should replace the letter \"Z\"\nwith \"A\" for one operation, the letter \"H\" \u2014 with the letter \"G\" for one\noperation. You will get the string \"ACTG\", in which the genome is present as a\nsubstring. In the second example, we replace the letter \"A\" with \"C\" for two\noperations, the letter \"D\" \u2014 with the letter \"A\" for three operations. You\nwill get the string \"ZACTG\", in which there is a genome.\n\n",
