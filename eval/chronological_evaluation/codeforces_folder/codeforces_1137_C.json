        "description": "In the country \n    N\n, there are \n    n\n cities connected by \n    m\n one-way\nroads. Although this country seems unremarkable, there are two interesting\nfacts about it. At first, a week lasts \n    d\n days here. At second, there is\nexactly one museum in each city of the country \n    N\n. Travel agency \"Open\nmuseums\" is developing a new program for tourists interested in museums.\nAgency's employees know which days each of the museums is open. The tour\nshould start in the capital \u2014 the city number \n    1\n, and the first day of\nthe tour must be on the first day of a week. Each day a tourist will be in\nsome city, watching the exposition in its museum (in case museum is open\ntoday), and by the end of the day, the tour either ends or the tourist goes\ninto another city connected by a road with the current one. The road system of\n\n    N\n is designed in such a way that traveling by a road always takes one\nnight and also all the roads are one-way. It's allowed to visit a city\nmultiple times during the trip. You should develop such route for the trip\nthat the number of distinct museums, possible to visit during it, is maximum.\nInput The first line contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n and \n    d\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 100\n     000\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 d \n    \u2264 50\n), the number of cities, the number of roads and the\nnumber of days in a week. Each of next \n    m\n lines contains two integers\n\n    u_i\n and \n    v_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    u_i \n     v_i\n),\ndenoting a one-way road from the city \n    u_i\n to the city \n    v_i\n. The\nnext \n    n\n lines contain the museums' schedule. The schedule of the museum\nlocated in the \n    i\n-th city is described in the \n    i\n-th of these lines.\nEach line consists of exactly \n    d\n characters \"0\" or \"1\", the \n    j\n-th\ncharacter of the string equals to \"1\" if the museum is open at the \n    j\n-th\nday of a week, and \"0\", otherwise. It's guaranteed that for each pair of\ncities \n    (u, v)\n there exists no more than one road leading from \n    u\n to\n\n    v\n. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of distinct\nmuseums, that it's possible to visit, starting a trip in the first city on the\nfirst day of the week. Examples Input 4 5 3 3 1 1 2 2 4 4 1 2 3 011 110 111\n001 Output 3 Input 3 3 7 1 2 1 3 2 3 1111111 0000000 0111111 Output 2 Note\nExplanation of the first example The maximum number of distinct museums to\nvisit is \n    3\n. It's possible to visit \n    3\n museums, for example, in the\nway described below. Day 1. Now it's the 1st day of a week, and the tourist is\nin the city \n    1\n. The museum there is closed. At night the tourist goes to\nthe city number \n    2\n. Day 2. Now it's the 2nd day of a week, and the\ntourist is in the city \n    2\n. The museum there is open, and the tourist\nvisits it. At night the tourist goes to the city number \n    4\n. Day 3. Now\nit's the 3rd day of a week, and the tourist is in the city \n    4\n. The museum\nthere is open, and the tourist visits it. At night the tourist goes to the\ncity number \n    1\n. Day 4. Now it's the 1st day of a week, and the tourist is\nin the city \n    1\n. The museum there is closed. At night the tourist goes to\nthe city number \n    2\n. Day 5. Now it's the 2nd of a week number \n    2\n, and\nthe tourist is in the city \n    2\n. The museum there is open, but the tourist\nhas already visited it. At night the tourist goes to the city number \n    3\n.\nDay 6. Now it's the 3rd day of a week, and the tourist is in the city \n    3\n.\nThe museum there is open, and the tourist visits it. After this, the tour is\nover. Explanation of the second example The maximum number of distinct museums\nto visit is \n    2\n. It's possible to visit \n    2\n museums, for example, in\nthe way described below. Day 1. Now it's the 1st day of a week, and the\ntourist is in the city \n    1\n. The museum there is open, and the tourist\nvisits it. At night the tourist goes to the city number \n    2\n. Day 2. Now\nit's the 2nd day of a week, and the tourist is in the city \n    2\n. The museum\nthere is closed. At night the tourist goes to the city number \n    3\n. Day 3.\nNow it's the 3rd day of a week, and the tourist is in the city \n    3\n. The\nmuseum there is open, and the tourist visits it. After this, the tour is over.\n\n",
