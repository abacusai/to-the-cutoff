        "description": "An array \n    b\n of length \n    k\n is called good if its arithmetic mean is\nequal to \n    1\n. More formally, if \n    \n\n    b_1 + \n    \u22ef +\n    b_k/k=1.\n\n    \n Note that the value \n    b_1+\n    \u22ef+b_k/k\n is not\nrounded up or down. For example, the array \n    [1,1,1,2]\n has an arithmetic\nmean of \n    1.25\n, which is not equal to \n    1\n. You are given an integer\narray \n    a\n of length \n    n\n. In an operation, you can append a non-\nnegative integer to the end of the array. What's the minimum number of\noperations required to make the array good? We have a proof that it is always\npossible with finitely many operations. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nThen \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a\nsingle integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the length of the\ninitial array \n    a\n. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    -10^4\n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^4\n), the\nelements of the array. Output For each test case, output a single integer \u2014\nthe minimum number of non-negative integers you have to append to the array so\nthat the arithmetic mean of the array will be exactly \n    1\n. Example Input 4\n3 1 1 1 2 1 2 4 8 4 6 2 1 -2 Output 0 1 16 1 Note In the first test case, we\ndon't need to add any element because the arithmetic mean of the array is\nalready \n    1\n, so the answer is \n    0\n. In the second test case, the\narithmetic mean is not \n    1\n initially so we need to add at least one more\nnumber. If we add \n    0\n then the arithmetic mean of the whole array becomes\n\n    1\n, so the answer is \n    1\n. In the third test case, the minimum number\nof elements that need to be added is \n    16\n since only non-negative integers\ncan be added. In the fourth test case, we can add a single integer \n    4\n.\nThe arithmetic mean becomes \n    -2+4/2\n which is equal to \n    1\n.\n\n",
