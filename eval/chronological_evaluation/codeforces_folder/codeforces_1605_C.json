        "description": "Ashish has a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n containing only characters 'a',\n'b' and 'c'. He wants to find the length of the smallest substring, which\nsatisfies the following conditions: Length of the substring is at least\n\n    2\n 'a' occurs strictly more times in this substring than 'b' 'a' occurs\nstrictly more times in this substring than 'c' Ashish is busy planning his\nnext Codeforces round. Help him solve the problem. A string \n    a\n is a\nsubstring of a string \n    b\n if \n    a\n can be obtained from \n    b\n by\ndeletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and\nseveral (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end. Input The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    t\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^5)\n \u2014 the number\nof test cases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each\ntest case contains a single integer \n    n\n \n    (2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^6)\n \u2014\nthe length of the string \n    s\n. The second line of each test case contains a\nstring \n    s\n consisting only of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    10^6\n. Output For each test case, output the length of the smallest\nsubstring which satisfies the given conditions or print \n    -1\n if there is\nno such substring. Example Input 3 2 aa 5 cbabb 8 cacabccc Output 2 -1 3 Note\nConsider the first test case. In the substring \"aa\", 'a' occurs twice, while\n'b' and 'c' occur zero times. Since 'a' occurs strictly more times than 'b'\nand 'c', the substring \"aa\" satisfies the condition and the answer is \n    2\n.\nThe substring \"a\" also satisfies this condition, however its length is not at\nleast \n    2\n. In the second test case, it can be shown that in none of the\nsubstrings of \"cbabb\" does 'a' occur strictly more times than 'b' and 'c'\neach. In the third test case, \"cacabccc\", the length of the smallest substring\nthat satisfies the conditions is \n    3\n.\n\n",
