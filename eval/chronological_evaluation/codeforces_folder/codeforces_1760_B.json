        "description": "In order to write a string, Atilla needs to first learn all letters that are\ncontained in the string. Atilla needs to write a message which can be\nrepresented as a string \n    s\n. He asks you what is the minimum alphabet size\nrequired so that one can write this message. The alphabet of size \n    x\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 26\n) contains only the first \n    x\n Latin letters.\nFor example an alphabet of size \n    4\n contains only the characters\n\n    \n, \n    \n, \n    \n and\n\n    \n. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of\neach test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n)\n\u2014 the length of the string. The second line of each test case contains a\nstring \n    s\n of length \n    n\n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\nOutput For each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum alphabet size\nrequired to so that Atilla can write his message \n    s\n. Example Input 5 1 a\n4 down 10 codeforces 3 bcf 5 zzzzz Output 1 23 19 6 26 Note For the first test\ncase, Atilla needs to know only the character \n    \n, so the\nalphabet of size \n    1\n which only contains \n    \n is enough. For\nthe second test case, Atilla needs to know the characters \n    \n,\n\n    \n, \n    \n, \n    \n. The smallest\nalphabet size that contains all of them is \n    23\n (such alphabet can be\nrepresented as the string \n    \n).\n\n",
