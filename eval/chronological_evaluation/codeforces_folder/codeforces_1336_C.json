        "name": "Kaavi and Magic Spell",
        "description": "Kaavi, the mysterious fortune teller, deeply believes that one's fate is\ninevitable and unavoidable. Of course, she makes her living by predicting\nothers' future. While doing divination, Kaavi believes that magic spells can\nprovide great power for her to see the future. Kaavi has a string \n    T\n of\nlength \n    m\n and all the strings with the prefix \n    T\n are magic spells.\nKaavi also has a string \n    S\n of length \n    n\n and an empty string \n    A\n.\nDuring the divination, Kaavi needs to perform a sequence of operations. There\nare two different operations: Delete the first character of \n    S\n and add it\nat the front of \n    A\n. Delete the first character of \n    S\n and add it at\nthe back of \n    A\n.Kaavi can perform no more than \n    n\n operations. To\nfinish the divination, she wants to know the number of different operation\nsequences to make \n    A\n a magic spell (i.e. with the prefix \n    T\n). As her\nassistant, can you help her? The answer might be huge, so Kaavi only needs to\nknow the answer modulo \n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Two operation sequences are\nconsidered different if they are different in length or there exists an\n\n    i\n that their \n    i\n-th operation is different. A substring is a\ncontiguous sequence of characters within a string. A prefix of a string\n\n    S\n is a substring of \n    S\n that occurs at the beginning of \n    S\n.\nInput The first line contains a string \n    S\n of length \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    n \n    \u2264 3000\n). The second line contains a string \n    T\n of length \n    m\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 n\n). Both strings contain only lowercase Latin\nletters. Output The output contains only one integer \u2014 the answer modulo\n\n    998\n     244\n     353\n. Examples Input abab ba Output 12 Input\ndefineintlonglong signedmain Output 0 Input rotator rotator Output 4 Input\ncacdcdbbbb bdcaccdbbb Output 24 Note The first test: The red ones are the\nmagic spells. In the first operation, Kaavi can either add the first character\n\"a\" at the front or the back of \n    A\n, although the results are the same,\nthey are considered as different operations. So the answer is\n\n    6\n    \u00d72=12\n.\n\n",
