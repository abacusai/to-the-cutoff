        "description": "A coder cannot sit and code all day. Sometimes it is a good idea to rise from\nthe desk, have a rest, have small talk with colleagues and even play. The\ncoders of the F company have their favorite ball game. Let's imagine the game\non the plane with a cartesian coordinate system. The point (0, 0) contains the\nplayer who chooses an arbitrary direction and throws a ball in that direction.\nThe ball hits the plane at distance d from the player's original position and\ncontinues flying in the same direction. After the ball hits the plane for the\nfirst time, it flies on and hits the plane again at distance 2\u00b7d from the\nplayer's original position and so on (it continue flying in the chosen\ndirection and hitting the plane after each d units). All coders in the F\ncompany are strong, so the ball flies infinitely far away. The plane has n\ncircles painted on it. If a ball hits the plane and hits a circle that is\npainted on the plane (including its border), then the player gets one point.\nThe ball can hit multiple circles at once and get one point for each of them\n(if the ball hits some circle x times during the move, the player also gets x\npoints). Count the maximum number of points a player can get if he throws a\nball in the arbitrary direction. Note that the direction may have real\ncooridinates. Input The first line contains two space-separated integers \u2014 n \u0438\nd (1 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710^4; 5 \u2264 d \u2264 10). Next n lines contain the circles' description.\nThe i-th line contains three space-separated integers xi, yi, ri ( - 10000 \u2264\nxi, yi \u2264 10000; 1 \u2264 r \u2264 50), where (xi, yi, ri) are the coordinates of the\ncenter and the radius of the circle, correspondingly. The point (0, 0) is not\ninside or on the border of some circle. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the\nmaximum number of points you can get. Examples Input 2 5 1 1 1 5 0 1 Output 1\nInput 2 5 4 0 3 5 3 1 Output 2 Input 1 10 20 0 10 Output 3\n\n",
