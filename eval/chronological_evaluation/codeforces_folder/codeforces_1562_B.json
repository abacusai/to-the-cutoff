        "description": "During the hypnosis session, Nicholas suddenly remembered a positive integer\n\n    n\n, which doesn't contain zeros in decimal notation. Soon, when he\nreturned home, he got curious: what is the maximum number of digits that can\nbe removed from the number so that the number becomes not prime, that is,\neither composite or equal to one? For some numbers doing so is impossible: for\nexample, for number \n    53\n it's impossible to delete some of its digits to\nobtain a not prime integer. However, for all \n    n\n in the test cases of this\nproblem, it's guaranteed that it's possible to delete some of their digits to\nobtain a not prime number. Note that you cannot remove all the digits from the\nnumber. A prime number is a number that has no divisors except one and itself.\nA composite is a number that has more than two divisors. \n    1\n is neither a\nprime nor a composite number. Input Each test contains multiple test cases.\nThe first line contains one positive integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^3\n), denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases\nfollows. The first line of each test case contains one positive integer\n\n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 50\n) \u2014 the number of digits in the number. The\nsecond line of each test case contains a positive integer \n    n\n, which\ndoesn't contain zeros in decimal notation (\n    10^k-1\n    \u2264 n < 10^k\n).\nIt is guaranteed that it is always possible to remove less than \n    k\n digits\nto make the number not prime. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    k\n over\nall test cases does not exceed \n    10^4\n. Output For every test case, print\ntwo numbers in two lines. In the first line print the number of digits, that\nyou have left in the number. In the second line print the digits left after\nall delitions. If there are multiple solutions, print any. Example Input 7 3\n237 5 44444 3 221 2 35 3 773 1 4 30 626221626221626221626221626221 Output 2 27\n1 4 1 1 2 35 2 77 1 4 1 6 Note In the first test case, you can't delete\n\n    2\n digits from the number \n    237\n, as all the numbers \n    2\n, \n    3\n,\nand \n    7\n are prime. However, you can delete \n    1\n digit, obtaining a\nnumber \n    27 = 3^3\n. In the second test case, you can delete all digits\nexcept one, as \n    4 = 2^2\n is a composite number.\n\n",
