        "name": "Sasha and His Trip",
        "description": "Sasha is a very happy guy, that's why he is always on the move. There are\n\n    n\n cities in the country where Sasha lives. They are all located on one\nstraight line, and for convenience, they are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n\nin increasing order. The distance between any two adjacent cities is equal to\n\n    1\n kilometer. Since all roads in the country are directed, it's possible\nto reach the city \n    y\n from the city \n    x\n only if \n    x < y\n. Once\nSasha decided to go on a trip around the country and to visit all \n    n\n\ncities. He will move with the help of his car, Cheetah-2677. The tank capacity\nof this model is \n    v\n liters, and it spends exactly \n    1\n liter of fuel\nfor \n    1\n kilometer of the way. At the beginning of the journey, the tank is\nempty. Sasha is located in the city with the number \n    1\n and wants to get\nto the city with the number \n    n\n. There is a gas station in each city. In\nthe \n    i\n-th city, the price of \n    1\n liter of fuel is \n    i\n dollars. It\nis obvious that at any moment of time, the tank can contain at most \n    v\n\nliters of fuel. Sasha doesn't like to waste money, that's why he wants to know\nwhat is the minimum amount of money is needed to finish the trip if he can buy\nfuel in any city he wants. Help him to figure it out! Input The first line\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    v\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 100\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 v \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of cities in the country and the capacity\nof the tank. Output Print one integer \u2014 the minimum amount of money that is\nneeded to finish the trip. Examples Input 4 2 Output 4 Input 7 6 Output 6 Note\nIn the first example, Sasha can buy \n    2\n liters for \n    2\n dollars\n(\n    1\n dollar per liter) in the first city, drive to the second city, spend\n\n    1\n liter of fuel on it, then buy \n    1\n liter for \n    2\n dollars in the\nsecond city and then drive to the \n    4\n-th city. Therefore, the answer is\n\n    1+1+2=4\n. In the second example, the capacity of the tank allows to fill\nthe tank completely in the first city, and drive to the last city without\nstops in other cities.\n\n",
