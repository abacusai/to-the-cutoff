        "description": "Maria participates in a bicycle race. The speedway takes place on the shores\nof Lake Lucerne, just repeating its contour. As you know, the lake shore\nconsists only of straight sections, directed to the north, south, east or\nwest. Let's introduce a system of coordinates, directing the Ox axis from west\nto east, and the Oy axis from south to north. As a starting position of the\nrace the southernmost point of the track is selected (and if there are several\nsuch points, the most western among them). The participants start the race,\nmoving to the north. At all straight sections of the track, the participants\ntravel in one of the four directions (north, south, east or west) and change\nthe direction of movement only in bends between the straight sections. The\nparticipants, of course, never turn back, that is, they do not change the\ndirection of movement from north to south or from east to west (or vice\nversa). Maria is still young, so she does not feel confident at some turns.\nNamely, Maria feels insecure if at a failed or untimely turn, she gets into\nthe water. In other words, Maria considers the turn dangerous if she\nimmediately gets into the water if it is ignored. Help Maria get ready for the\ncompetition \u2014 determine the number of dangerous turns on the track. Input The\nfirst line of the input contains an integer n (4 \u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of\nstraight sections of the track. The following (n + 1)-th line contains pairs\nof integers (xi, yi) ( - 10 000 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 10 000). The first of these points\nis the starting position. The i-th straight section of the track begins at the\npoint (xi, yi) and ends at the point (xi + 1, yi + 1). It is guaranteed that:\nthe first straight section is directed to the north; the southernmost (and if\nthere are several, then the most western of among them) point of the track is\nthe first point; the last point coincides with the first one (i.e., the start\nposition); any pair of straight sections of the track has no shared points\n(except for the neighboring ones, they share exactly one point); no pair of\npoints (except for the first and last one) is the same; no two adjacent\nstraight sections are directed in the same direction or in opposite\ndirections. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of dangerous turns on\nthe track. Examples Input 6 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 Output 1 Input 16 1 1\n1 5 3 5 3 7 2 7 2 9 6 9 6 7 5 7 5 3 4 3 4 4 3 4 3 2 5 2 5 1 1 1 Output 6 Note\nThe first sample corresponds to the picture: The picture shows that you can\nget in the water under unfortunate circumstances only at turn at the point (1,\n1). Thus, the answer is 1.\n\n",
