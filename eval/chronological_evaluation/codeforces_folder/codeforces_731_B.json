        "description": "The programming competition season has already started and it's time to train\nfor ICPC. Sereja coaches his teams for a number of year and he knows that to\nget ready for the training session it's not enough to prepare only problems\nand editorial. As the training sessions lasts for several hours, teams become\nhungry. Thus, Sereja orders a number of pizzas so they can eat right after the\nend of the competition. Teams plan to train for n times during n consecutive\ndays. During the training session Sereja orders exactly one pizza for each\nteam that is present this day. He already knows that there will be ai teams on\nthe i-th day. There are two types of discounts in Sereja's favourite pizzeria.\nThe first discount works if one buys two pizzas at one day, while the second\nis a coupon that allows to buy one pizza during two consecutive days (two\npizzas in total). As Sereja orders really a lot of pizza at this place, he is\nthe golden client and can use the unlimited number of discounts and coupons of\nany type at any days. Sereja wants to order exactly ai pizzas on the i-th day\nwhile using only discounts and coupons. Note, that he will never buy more\npizzas than he need for this particular day. Help him determine, whether he\ncan buy the proper amount of pizzas each day if he is allowed to use only\ncoupons and discounts. Note, that it's also prohibited to have any active\ncoupons after the end of the day n. Input The first line of input contains a\nsingle integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number of training sessions. The\nsecond line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 \u2264 ai \u2264 10 000) \u2014 the number\nof teams that will be present on each of the days. Output If there is a way to\norder pizzas using only coupons and discounts and do not buy any extra pizzas\non any of the days, then print \"YES\" (without quotes) in the only line of\noutput. Otherwise, print \"NO\" (without quotes). Examples Input 4 1 2 1 2\nOutput YES Input 3 1 0 1 Output NO Note In the first sample, Sereja can use\none coupon to buy one pizza on the first and the second days, one coupon to\nbuy pizza on the second and the third days and one discount to buy pizzas on\nthe fourth days. This is the only way to order pizzas for this sample. In the\nsecond sample, Sereja can't use neither the coupon nor the discount without\nordering an extra pizza. Note, that it's possible that there will be no teams\nattending the training sessions on some days.\n\n",
