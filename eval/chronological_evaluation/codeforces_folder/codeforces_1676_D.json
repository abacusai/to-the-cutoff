        "description": "Timur's grandfather gifted him a chessboard to practice his chess skills. This\nchessboard is a grid \n    a\n with \n    n\n rows and \n    m\n columns with each\ncell having a non-negative integer written on it. Timur's challenge is to\nplace a bishop on the board such that the sum of all cells attacked by the\nbishop is maximal. The bishop attacks in all directions diagonally, and there\nis no limit to the distance which the bishop can attack. Note that the cell on\nwhich the bishop is placed is also considered attacked. Help him find the\nmaximal sum he can get. Input The first line of the input contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains\nthe integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 200\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 m\n    \n    \u2264 200\n). The following \n    n\n lines contain \n    m\n integers each, the\n\n    j\n-th element of the \n    i\n-th line \n    a_ij\n is the number written\nin the \n    j\n-th cell of the \n    i\n-th row \n    (0\n    \u2264 a_ij\n    \u2264\n    10^6)\n It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n    \u00b7 m\n over all test cases\ndoes not exceed \n    4\n    \u00b710^4\n. Output For each test case output a single\ninteger, the maximum sum over all possible placements of the bishop. Example\nInput 4 4 4 1 2 2 1 2 4 2 4 2 2 3 1 2 4 2 4 2 1 1 0 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 Output 20 1 5 3 Note For the first test case here the best\nsum is achieved by the bishop being in this position:\n\n",
