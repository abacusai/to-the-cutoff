        "description": "Nikola owns a large warehouse which is illuminated by \n    N\n light bulbs,\nnumbered \n    1\n to \n    N\n. At the exit of the warehouse, there are \n    S\n\nlight switches, numbered \n    1\n to \n    S\n. Each switch swaps the on/off\nstate for some light bulbs, so if a light bulb is off, flipping the switch\nturns it on, and if the light bulb is on, flipping the switch turns it off. At\nthe end of the day, Nikola wants to turn all the lights off. To achieve this,\nhe will flip some of the light switches at the exit of the warehouse, but\nsince Nikola is lazy, he wants to flip the _minimum_ number of switches\nrequired to turn all the lights off. Since Nikola was not able to calculate\nthe minimum number of switches, he asked you to help him. During a period of\n\n    D\n days, Nikola noted which light bulbs were off and which were on at the\nend of each day. He wants you to tell him the minimum number of switches he\nneeded to flip to turn all the lights off for each of the \n    D\n days or tell\nhim that it's impossible. Input First line contains three integers, \n    N\n,\n\n    S\n and \n    D\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 10^3\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 S \n    \u2264 30\n,\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 D \n    \u2264 10^3\n) \u2013 representing number of light bulbs, the number\nof light switches, and the number of days respectively. The next \n    S\n lines\ncontain the description of each light switch as follows: The first number in\nthe line, \n    C_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 C_i \n    \u2264 N\n), represents the number of\nlight bulbs for which the on/off state is swapped by light switch \n    i\n, the\nnext \n    C_i\n numbers (sorted in increasing order) represent the indices of\nthose light bulbs. The next \n    D\n lines contain the description of light\nbulbs for each day as follows: The first number in the line, \n    T_i\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 T_i \n    \u2264 N\n), represents the number of light bulbs which are on at\nthe end of day \n    i\n, the next \n    T_i\n numbers (sorted in increasing\norder) represent the indices of those light bulbs. Output Print \n    D\n lines,\none for each day. In the \n    i^th\n line, print the minimum number of\nswitches that need to be flipped on day \n    i\n, or \n    -1\n if it's\nimpossible to turn all the lights off.
