        "description": "The marmots need to prepare k problems for HC^2 over n days. Each problem,\nonce prepared, also has to be printed. The preparation of a problem on day i\n(at most one per day) costs ai CHF, and the printing of a problem on day i\n(also at most one per day) costs bi CHF. Of course, a problem cannot be\nprinted before it has been prepared (but doing both on the same day is fine).\nWhat is the minimum cost of preparation and printing? Input The first line of\ninput contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2200). The\nsecond line contains n space-separated integers a1, ..., an () \u2014 the\npreparation costs. The third line contains n space-separated integers b1, ...,\nbn () \u2014 the printing costs. Output Output the minimum cost of preparation and\nprinting k problems \u2014 that is, the minimum possible sum ai1 + ai2 + ... + aik\n+ bj1 + bj2 + ... + bjk, where 1 \u2264 i1 < i2 < ... < ik \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 j1 < j2 < ... <\njk \u2264 n and i1 \u2264 j1, i2 \u2264 j2, ..., ik \u2264 jk. Example Input 8 4 3 8 7 9 9 4 6 8 2\n5 9 4 3 8 9 1 Output 32 Note In the sample testcase, one optimum solution is\nto prepare the first problem on day 1 and print it on day 1, prepare the\nsecond problem on day 2 and print it on day 4, prepare the third problem on\nday 3 and print it on day 5, and prepare the fourth problem on day 6 and print\nit on day 8.\n\n",
