        "name": "The Modcrab",
        "description": "Vova is again playing some computer game, now an RPG. In the game Vova's\ncharacter received a quest: to slay the fearsome monster called Modcrab. After\ntwo hours of playing the game Vova has tracked the monster and analyzed its\ntactics. The Modcrab has h2 health points and an attack power of a2. Knowing\nthat, Vova has decided to buy a lot of strong healing potions and to prepare\nfor battle. Vova's character has h1 health points and an attack power of a1.\nAlso he has a large supply of healing potions, each of which increases his\ncurrent amount of health points by c1 when Vova drinks a potion. All potions\nare identical to each other. It is guaranteed that c1 > a2. The battle\nconsists of multiple phases. In the beginning of each phase, Vova can either\nattack the monster (thus reducing its health by a1) or drink a healing potion\n(it increases Vova's health by c1; Vova's health can exceed h1). Then, if the\nbattle is not over yet, the Modcrab attacks Vova, reducing his health by a2.\nThe battle ends when Vova's (or Modcrab's) health drops to 0 or lower. It is\npossible that the battle ends in a middle of a phase after Vova's attack. Of\ncourse, Vova wants to win the fight. But also he wants to do it as fast as\npossible. So he wants to make up a strategy that will allow him to win the\nfight after the minimum possible number of phases. Help Vova to make up a\nstrategy! You may assume that Vova never runs out of healing potions, and that\nhe can always win. Input The first line contains three integers h1, a1, c1 (1\n\u2264 h1, a1 \u2264 100, 2 \u2264 c1 \u2264 100) \u2014 Vova's health, Vova's attack power and the\nhealing power of a potion. The second line contains two integers h2, a2 (1 \u2264\nh2 \u2264 100, 1 \u2264 a2 < c1) \u2014 the Modcrab's health and his attack power. Output In\nthe first line print one integer n denoting the minimum number of phases\nrequired to win the battle. Then print n lines. i-th line must be equal to\nHEAL if Vova drinks a potion in i-th phase, or STRIKE if he attacks the\nModcrab. The strategy must be valid: Vova's character must not be defeated\nbefore slaying the Modcrab, and the monster's health must be 0 or lower after\nVova's last action. If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of\nthem. Examples Input 10 6 100 17 5 Output 4 STRIKE HEAL STRIKE STRIKE Input 11\n6 100 12 5 Output 2 STRIKE STRIKE Note In the first example Vova's character\nmust heal before or after his first attack. Otherwise his health will drop to\nzero in 2 phases while he needs 3 strikes to win. In the second example no\nhealing needed, two strikes are enough to get monster to zero health and win\nwith 6 health left.\n\n",
