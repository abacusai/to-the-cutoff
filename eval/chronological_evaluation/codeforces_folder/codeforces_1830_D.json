        "description": "You are given a tree with \n    n\n nodes. For each node, you either color it in\n\n    0\n or \n    1\n. The value of a path \n    (u,v)\n is equal to the\nMEX\n    ^\n    \u2020\n of the colors of the nodes from the shortest path between\n\n    u\n and \n    v\n. The value of a coloring is equal to the sum of values of\nall paths \n    (u,v)\n such that \n    1 \n    \u2264 u \n    \u2264 v \n    \u2264 n\n. What is\nthe maximum possible value of any coloring of the tree? \n    ^\n    \u2020\n The\nMEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that\ndoes not belong to the array. For instance: The MEX of \n    [2,2,1]\n is\n\n    0\n, because \n    0\n does not belong to the array. The MEX of\n\n    [3,1,0,1]\n is \n    2\n, because \n    0\n and \n    1\n belong to the array,\nbut \n    2\n does not. The MEX of \n    [0,3,1,2]\n is \n    4\n because \n    0\n,\n\n    1\n, \n    2\n, and \n    3\n belong to the array, but \n    4\n does not. Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test\ncases. The description of test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of nodes in the tree. The following \n    n-1\n lines of each test case\ncontains \n    2\n integers \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264\n    n, a_i \n    \u2260 b_i\n) \u2014 indicating an edge between vertices \n    a_i\n and\n\n    b_i\n. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree. It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n across all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n. Output For each test case, print the maximum possible value of any\ncoloring of the tree. Example Input 4 3 1 2 2 3 4 1 2 1 3 1 4 10 1 2 1 3 3 4 3\n5 1 6 5 7 2 8 6 9 6 10 1 Output 8 15 96 1 Note In the first sample, we will\ncolor vertex \n    2\n in \n    1\n and vertices \n    1,3\n in \n    0\n. After this,\nwe consider all paths: \n    (1,1)\n with value \n    1\n \n    (1,2)\n with value\n\n    2\n \n    (1,3)\n with value \n    2\n \n    (2,2)\n with value \n    0\n\n\n    (2,3)\n with value \n    2\n \n    (3,3)\n with value \n    1\n We notice the\nsum of values is \n    8\n which is the maximum possible.\n\n",
