        "description": "There are \n    n\n participants in a competition, participant \n    i\n having a\nstrength of \n    s_i\n. Every participant wonders how much of an advantage they\nhave over the other best participant. In other words, each participant \n    i\n\nwants to know the difference between \n    s_i\n and \n    s_j\n, where \n    j\n is\nthe strongest participant in the competition, not counting \n    i\n (a\ndifference can be negative). So, they ask you for your help! For each \n    i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) output the difference between \n    s_i\n and the\nmaximum strength of any participant other than participant \n    i\n. Input The\ninput consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescriptions of the test cases follow. The first line of each test case\ncontains an integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2\n    \u00b710^5\n) \u2014 the\nlength of the array. The following line contains \n    n\n space-separated\npositive integers \n    s_1\n, \n    s_2\n, ..., \n    s_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 s_i \n    \u2264\n    10^9\n) \u2014 the strengths of the participants. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    2\n    \u00b710^5\n. Output For\neach test case, output \n    n\n space-separated integers. For each \n    i\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) output the difference between \n    s_i\n and the\nmaximum strength of any other participant. Example Input 5 4 4 7 3 5 2 1 2 5 1\n2 3 4 5 3 4 9 4 4 4 4 4 4 Output -3 2 -4 -2 -1 1 -4 -3 -2 -1 1 -5 5 -5 0 0 0 0\nNote For the first test case: The first participant has a strength of \n    4\n\nand the largest strength of a participant different from the first one is\n\n    7\n, so the answer for the first participant is \n    4 - 7 = -3\n. The\nsecond participant has a strength of \n    7\n and the largest strength of a\nparticipant different from the second one is \n    5\n, so the answer for the\nsecond participant is \n    7 - 5 = 2\n. The third participant has a strength of\n\n    3\n and the largest strength of a participant different from the third one\nis \n    7\n, so the answer for the third participant is \n    3 - 7 = -4\n. The\nfourth participant has a strength of \n    5\n and the largest strength of a\nparticipant different from the fourth one is \n    7\n, so the answer for the\nfourth participant is \n    5 - 7 = -2\n.\n\n",
