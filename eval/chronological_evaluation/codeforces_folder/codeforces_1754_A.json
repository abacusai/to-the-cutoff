        "description": "You work in the quality control department of technical support for a large\ncompany. Your job is to make sure all client issues have been resolved. Today\nyou need to check a copy of a dialog between a client and a technical support\nmanager. According to the rules of work, each message of the client must be\nfollowed by one or several messages, which are the answer of a support\nmanager. However, sometimes clients ask questions so quickly that some of the\nmanager's answers to old questions appear after the client has asked some new\nquestions. Due to the privacy policy, the full text of messages is not\navailable to you, only the order of messages is visible, as well as the type\nof each message: a customer question or a response from the technical support\nmanager. It is guaranteed that the dialog begins with the question of the\nclient. You have to determine, if this dialog may correspond to the rules of\nwork described above, or the rules are certainly breached. Input Each test\ncontains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases\n\n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 500\n). Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the total number of messages in the dialog. The second line of\neach test case consists of \n    n\n characters \"Q\" and \"A\", describing types of\nmessages in the dialog in chronological order. Character \"Q\" denotes the\nmessage with client question, and character \"A\" \u2014 the message with technical\nsupport manager answer. It is guaranteed that the first character in the line\nequals to \"Q\". Output For each test case print \"Yes\" (without quotes) if\ndialog may correspond to the rules of work, or \"No\" (without quotes)\notherwise. Example Input 5 4 QQAA 4 QQAQ 3 QAA 1 Q 14 QAQQAQAAQQQAAA Output\nYes No Yes No Yes Note In the first test case the two questions from the\nclient are followed with two specialist's answers. So this dialog may\ncorrespond to the rules of work. In the second test case one of the first two\nquestions was not answered. In the third test case the technical support\nmanager sent two messaged as the answer to the only message of the client.\n\n",
