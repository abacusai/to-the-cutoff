        "description": "You are given three multisets of pairs of colored sticks: \n    R\n pairs of red\nsticks, the first pair has length \n    r_1\n, the second pair has length\n\n    r_2\n, \n    \u2026\n, the \n    R\n-th pair has length \n    r_R\n; \n    G\n\npairs of green sticks, the first pair has length \n    g_1\n, the second pair\nhas length \n    g_2\n, \n    \u2026\n, the \n    G\n-th pair has length \n    g_G\n;\n\n    B\n pairs of blue sticks, the first pair has length \n    b_1\n, the second\npair has length \n    b_2\n, \n    \u2026\n, the \n    B\n-th pair has length\n\n    b_B\n; You are constructing rectangles from these pairs of sticks with the\nfollowing process: take a pair of sticks of one color; take a pair of sticks\nof another color different from the first one; add the area of the resulting\nrectangle to the total area. Thus, you get such rectangles that their opposite\nsides are the same color and their adjacent sides are not the same color. Each\npair of sticks can be used at most once, some pairs can be left unused. You\nare not allowed to split a pair into independent sticks. What is the maximum\narea you can achieve? Input The first line contains three integers \n    R\n,\n\n    G\n, \n    B\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 R, G, B \n    \u2264 200\n) \u2014 the number of pairs of\nred sticks, the number of pairs of green sticks and the number of pairs of\nblue sticks. The second line contains \n    R\n integers \n    r_1, r_2, \n    \u2026,\n    r_R\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 r_i \n    \u2264 2000\n) \u2014 the lengths of sticks in each pair of\nred sticks. The third line contains \n    G\n integers \n    g_1, g_2, \n    \u2026,\n    g_G\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 g_i \n    \u2264 2000\n) \u2014 the lengths of sticks in each pair of\ngreen sticks. The fourth line contains \n    B\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026,\n    b_B\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 2000\n) \u2014 the lengths of sticks in each pair of\nblue sticks. Output Print the maximum possible total area of the constructed\nrectangles. Examples Input 1 1 1 3 5 4 Output 20 Input 2 1 3 9 5 1 2 8 5\nOutput 99 Input 10 1 1 11 7 20 15 19 14 2 4 13 14 8 11 Output 372 Note In the\nfirst example you can construct one of these rectangles: red and green with\nsides \n    3\n and \n    5\n, red and blue with sides \n    3\n and \n    4\n and\ngreen and blue with sides \n    5\n and \n    4\n. The best area of them is \n    4\n    \n    \u00d7 5 = 20\n. In the second example the best rectangles are: red/blue\n\n    9 \n    \u00d7 8\n, red/blue \n    5 \n    \u00d7 5\n, green/blue \n    2 \n    \u00d7\n    1\n. So the total area is \n    72 + 25 + 2 = 99\n. In the third example the\nbest rectangles are: red/green \n    19 \n    \u00d7 8\n and red/blue \n    20 \n    \u00d7\n    11\n. The total area is \n    152 + 220 = 372\n. Note that you can't construct\nmore rectangles because you are not allowed to have both pairs taken to be the\nsame color.\n\n",
