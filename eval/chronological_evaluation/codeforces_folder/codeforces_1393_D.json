        "name": "Rarity and New Dress",
        "description": "Carousel Boutique is busy again! Rarity has decided to visit the pony ball and\nshe surely needs a new dress, because going out in the same dress several\ntimes is a sign of bad manners. First of all, she needs a dress pattern, which\nshe is going to cut out from the rectangular piece of the multicolored fabric.\nThe piece of the multicolored fabric consists of \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n separate\nsquare scraps. Since Rarity likes dresses in style, a dress pattern must only\ninclude scraps sharing the same color. A dress pattern must be the square, and\nsince Rarity is fond of rhombuses, the sides of a pattern must form a\n\n    45^\n    \u2218\n angle with sides of a piece of fabric (that way it will be\nresembling the traditional picture of a rhombus). Examples of proper dress\npatterns: Examples of improper dress patterns: The first one consists of\nmulti-colored scraps, the second one goes beyond the bounds of the piece of\nfabric, the third one is not a square with sides forming a \n    45^\n    \u2218\n\nangle with sides of the piece of fabric. Rarity wonders how many ways to cut\nout a dress pattern that satisfies all the conditions that do exist. Please\nhelp her and satisfy her curiosity so she can continue working on her new\nmasterpiece! Input The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 2000\n). Each of the next \n    n\n lines contains\n\n    m\n characters: lowercase English letters, the \n    j\n-th of which\ncorresponds to scrap in the current line and in the \n    j\n-th column. Scraps\nhaving the same letter share the same color, scraps having different letters\nhave different colors. Output Print a single integer: the number of ways to\ncut out a dress pattern to satisfy all of Rarity's conditions. Examples Input\n3 3 aaa aaa aaa Output 10 Input 3 4 abab baba abab Output 12 Input 5 5 zbacg\nbaaac aaaaa eaaad weadd Output 31 Note In the first example, all the dress\npatterns of size \n    1\n and one of size \n    2\n are satisfactory. In the\nsecond example, only the dress patterns of size \n    1\n are satisfactory.\n\n",
