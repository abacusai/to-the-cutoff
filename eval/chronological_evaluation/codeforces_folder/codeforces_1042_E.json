        "description": "Vasya has got a magic matrix \n    a\n of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n. The rows of\nthe matrix are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n from top to bottom, the\ncolumns are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    m\n from left to right. Let\n\n    a_ij\n be the element in the intersection of the \n    i\n-th row and the\n\n    j\n-th column. Vasya has also got a chip. Initially, the chip is in the\nintersection of the \n    r\n-th row and the \n    c\n-th column (that is, in the\nelement \n    a_rc\n). Vasya performs the following process as long as\npossible: among all elements of the matrix having their value less than the\nvalue of the element with the chip in it, Vasya randomly and equiprobably\nchooses one element and moves his chip to this element. After moving the chip,\nhe adds to his score the square of the Euclidean distance between these\nelements (that is, between the element in which the chip is now and the\nelement the chip was moved from). The process ends when there are no elements\nhaving their values less than the value of the element with the chip in it.\nEuclidean distance between matrix elements with coordinates \n    (i_1, j_1)\n\nand \n    (i_2, j_2)\n is equal to \n    \u221a((i_1-i_2)^2 + (j_1-j_2)^2)\n.\nCalculate the expected value of the Vasya's final score. It can be shown that\nthe answer can be represented as \n    P/Q\n, where \n    P\n and\n\n    Q\n are coprime integer numbers, and \n    Q \n    \u2261 0\u00a0(mod \u00a0\n    998244353)\n. Print the value \n    P \n    \u00b7 Q^-1\n modulo \n    998244353\n.\nInput The first line of the input contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n\n\n    (1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 1\n     000)\n \u2014 the number of rows and the number of\ncolumns in the matrix \n    a\n. The following \n    n\n lines contain description\nof the matrix \n    a\n. The \n    i\n-th line contains \n    m\n integers\n\n    a_i1, a_i2, \n    \u2026, a_im\u00a0 (0 \n    \u2264 a_ij\n    \u2264 10^9)\n. The\nfollowing line contains two integers \n    r\n and \n    c\n \n    (1 \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264\n    n, 1 \n    \u2264 c \n    \u2264 m)\n \u2014 the index of row and the index of column where the\nchip is now. Output Print the expected value of Vasya's final score in the\nformat described in the problem statement. Examples Input 1 4 1 1 2 1 1 3\nOutput 2 Input 2 3 1 5 7 2 3 1 1 2 Output 665496238 Note In the first example,\nVasya will move his chip exactly once. The expected value of the final score\nis equal to \n    1^2 + 2^2+ 1^2/3 = 2\n.\n\n",
