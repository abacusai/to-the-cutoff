        "name": "Harry Vs Voldemort",
        "description": "After destroying all of Voldemort's Horcruxes, Harry and Voldemort are up for\nthe final battle. They each cast spells from their wands and the spells\ncollide. The battle scene is Hogwarts, which can be represented in the form of\na tree. There are, in total, n places in Hogwarts joined using n - 1\nundirected roads. Ron, who was viewing this battle between Harry and\nVoldemort, wondered how many triplets of places (u, v, w) are there such that\nif Harry is standing at place u and Voldemort is standing at place v, their\nspells collide at a place w. This is possible for a triplet only when u, v and\nw are distinct, and there exist paths from u to w and from v to w which do not\npass through the same roads. Now, due to the battle havoc, new paths are being\nadded all the time. You have to tell Ron the answer after each addition.\nFormally, you are given a tree with n vertices and n - 1 edges. q new edges\nare being added between the nodes of the tree. After each addition you need to\ntell the number of triplets (u, v, w) such that u, v and w are distinct and\nthere exist two paths, one between u and w, another between v and w such that\nthese paths do not have an edge in common. Input First line contains an\ninteger n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), the number of places in Hogwarts. Each of the next n\n- 1 lines contains two space separated integers u and v (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n)\nindicating a road between places u and v. It is guaranteed that the given\nroads form a connected tree. Next line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264\n10^5), the number of new edges being added. Each of the next q lines contains\ntwo space separated integers u and v (1 \u2264 u, v \u2264 n) representing the new road\nbeing added. Note that it is possible that a newly added road connects places\nthat were connected by a road before. Also, a newly added road may connect a\nplace to itself. Output In the first line print the value for the number of\ntriplets before any changes occurred. After that print q lines, a single\ninteger ansi in each line containing the value for the number of triplets\nafter i-th edge addition. Examples Input 3 1 2 2 3 1 2 3 Output 2 4 Input 4 1\n2 2 3 2 4 2 1 4 3 4 Output 6 18 24 Input 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 1 1 5 Output 20 60\nNote In the first sample case, for the initial tree, we have (1, 3, 2) and (3,\n1, 2) as the only possible triplets (u, v, w). After addition of edge from 2\nto 3, we have (1, 3, 2), (3, 1, 2), (1, 2, 3) and (2, 1, 3) as the possible\ntriplets.\n\n",
