        "description": "One day Vasya the Hipster decided to count how many socks he had. It turned\nout that he had a red socks and b blue socks. According to the latest fashion,\nhipsters should wear the socks of different colors: a red one on the left\nfoot, a blue one on the right foot. Every day Vasya puts on new socks in the\nmorning and throws them away before going to bed as he doesn't want to wash\nthem. Vasya wonders, what is the maximum number of days when he can dress\nfashionable and wear different socks, and after that, for how many days he can\nthen wear the same socks until he either runs out of socks or cannot make a\nsingle pair from the socks he's got. Can you help him? Input The single line\nof the input contains two positive integers a and b (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 100) \u2014 the\nnumber of red and blue socks that Vasya's got. Output Print two space-\nseparated integers \u2014 the maximum number of days when Vasya can wear different\nsocks and the number of days when he can wear the same socks until he either\nruns out of socks or cannot make a single pair from the socks he's got. Keep\nin mind that at the end of the day Vasya throws away the socks that he's been\nwearing on that day. Examples Input 3 1 Output 1 1 Input 2 3 Output 2 0 Input\n7 3 Output 3 2 Note In the first sample Vasya can first put on one pair of\ndifferent socks, after that he has two red socks left to wear on the second\nday.\n\n",
