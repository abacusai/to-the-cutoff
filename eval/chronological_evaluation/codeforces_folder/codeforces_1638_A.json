        "description": "You are given a permutation \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n of length \n    n\n.\nYou have to choose two integers \n    l,r\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l \n    \u2264 r \n    \u2264 n\n)\nand reverse the subsegment \n    [l,r]\n of the permutation. The permutation\nwill become \n    p_1,p_2, \n    \u2026, p_l-1,p_r,p_r-1, \n    \u2026,\n    p_l,p_r+1,p_r+2, \n    \u2026 ,p_n\n. Find the lexicographically smallest\npermutation that can be obtained by performing exactly one reverse operation\non the initial permutation. Note that for two distinct permutations of equal\nlength \n    a\n and \n    b\n, \n    a\n is lexicographically smaller than \n    b\n\nif at the first position they differ, \n    a\n has the smaller element. A\npermutation is an array consisting of \n    n\n distinct integers from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n in arbitrary order. For example, \n    [2,3,1,5,4]\n is a\npermutation, but \n    [1,2,2]\n is not a permutation (\n    2\n appears twice in\nthe array) and \n    [1,3,4]\n is also not a permutation (\n    n=3\n but there is\n\n    4\n in the array). Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first\nline contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 500\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of test cases. Description of the test cases follows. The first line of\neach test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 500\n) \u2014\nthe length of the permutation. The second line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014\nthe elements of the permutation. Output For each test case print the\nlexicographically smallest permutation you can obtain. Example Input 4 1 1 3 2\n1 3 4 1 4 2 3 5 1 2 3 4 5 Output 1 1 2 3 1 2 4 3 1 2 3 4 5 Note In the first\ntest case, the permutation has length \n    1\n, so the only possible segment is\n\n    [1,1]\n. The resulting permutation is \n    [1]\n. In the second test case,\nwe can obtain the identity permutation by reversing the segment \n    [1,2]\n.\nThe resulting permutation is \n    [1,2,3]\n. In the third test case, the best\npossible segment is \n    [2,3]\n. The resulting permutation is \n    [1,2,4,3]\n.\nIn the fourth test case, there is no lexicographically smaller permutation, so\nwe can leave it unchanged by choosing the segment \n    [1,1]\n. The resulting\npermutation is \n    [1,2,3,4,5]\n.\n\n",
