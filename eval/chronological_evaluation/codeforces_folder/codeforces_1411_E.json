        "description": "You've got a string \n    S\n consisting of \n    n\n lowercase English letters\nfrom your friend. It turned out that this is a number written in poman\nnumerals. The poman numeral system is long forgotten. All that's left is the\nalgorithm to transform number from poman numerals to the numeral system\nfamiliar to us. Characters of \n    S\n are numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n\nfrom left to right. Let's denote the value of \n    S\n as \n    f(S)\n, it is\ndefined as follows: If \n    |S| > 1\n, an arbitrary integer \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    m < |S|\n) is chosen, and it is defined that \n    f(S) = -f(S[1, m]) + f(S[m +\n    1, |S|])\n, where \n    S[l, r]\n denotes the substring of \n    S\n from the\n\n    l\n-th to the \n    r\n-th position, inclusively. Otherwise \n    S = c\n,\nwhere \n    c\n is some English letter. Then \n    f(S) = 2^pos(c)\n, where\n\n    pos(c)\n is the position of letter \n    c\n in the alphabet\n(\n    pos(\na\n    ) = 0\n, \n    pos(\nz\n    ) = 25\n). Note that \n    m\n is chosen\nindependently on each step. Your friend thinks it is possible to get \n    f(S) =\n    T\n by choosing the right \n    m\n on every step. Is he right? Input The first\nline contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    T\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n,\n\n    -10^15\n    \u2264 T \n    \u2264 10^15\n). The second line contains a string\n\n    S\n consisting of \n    n\n lowercase English letters. Output Print \"Yes\" if\nit is possible to get the desired value. Otherwise, print \"No\". You can print\neach letter in any case (upper or lower). Examples Input 2 -1 ba Output Yes\nInput 3 -7 abc Output No Input 7 -475391 qohshra Output Yes Note In the second\nexample, you cannot get \n    -7\n. But you can get \n    1\n, for example, as\nfollows: First choose \n    m = 1\n, then \n    f(\nabc\n    ) = -f(\na\n    ) +\n    f(\nbc\n    )\n \n    f(\na\n    ) = 2^0 = 1\n \n    f(\nbc\n    ) = -f(\nb\n    ) +\n    f(\nc\n    ) = -2^1 + 2^2 = 2\n In the end \n    f(\nabc\n    ) = -1 + 2 = 1\n\n\n",
