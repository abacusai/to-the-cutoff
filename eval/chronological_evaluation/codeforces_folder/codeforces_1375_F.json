        "description": "This is an interactive problem. Anton and Harris are playing a game to decide\nwhich of them is the king of problemsetting. There are three piles of stones,\ninitially containing \n    a\n, \n    b\n, and \n    c\n stones, where \n    a\n,\n\n    b\n, and \n    c\n are distinct positive integers. On each turn of the game,\nthe following sequence of events takes place: The first player chooses a\npositive integer \n    y\n and provides it to the second player. The second\nplayer adds \n    y\n stones to one of the piles, with the condition that he\ncannot choose the same pile in two consecutive turns. The second player loses\nif, at any point, two of the piles contain the same number of stones. The\nfirst player loses if \n    1000\n turns have passed without the second player\nlosing. Feeling confident in his skills, Anton decided to let Harris choose\nwhether he wants to go first or second. Help Harris defeat Anton and become\nthe king of problemsetting! Input The first line of input contains three\ndistinct positive integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, and \n    c\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a, b, c\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the initial number of stones in piles \n    1\n, \n    2\n, and\n\n    3\n respectively. Interaction The interaction begins by reading the\nintegers \n    a\n, \n    b\n and \n    c\n. After reading the integers, print a\nsingle line containing either \"First\" or \"Second\", denoting who you want to\nplay as (as first or second correspondently). On each turn, the first player\n(either you or the judge) must print a positive integer \n    y\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 y\n    \n    \u2264 10^12\n). Then, the second player must print \n    1\n, \n    2\n, or\n\n    3\n, indicating which pile should have \n    y\n stones added to it. From\nthe second turn onwards, the pile that the second player chooses must be\ndifferent from the pile that they chose on the previous turn. If you are\nplaying as Second and complete \n    1000\n turns without losing, or if you are\nplaying as First and the judge has determined that it cannot make a move\nwithout losing, the interactor will print \n    0\n and will finish interaction.\nThis means that your program is correct for this test case, and you should\nexit immediately. If you are playing as First and complete \n    1000\n turns\nwithout winning, or if you are playing as Second and print a move that makes\ntwo piles have the same number of stones, or if you output an invalid move as\neither player, the interactor will print \n    -1\n and will finish interaction.\nYou will receive a Wrong Answer verdict. Make sure to exit immediately to\navoid getting other verdicts. After printing something do not forget to output\nend of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit\nexceeded. To do this, use: fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;\nSystem.out.flush() in Java; flush(output) in Pascal; stdout.flush() in Python;\nsee documentation for other languages. In this problem, hacks are disabled.\nExample Input 5 2 6 3 0 Output First 2 3 Note In the sample input, the piles\ninitially have \n    5\n, \n    2\n, and \n    6\n stones. Harris decides to go\nfirst and provides the number \n    2\n to Anton. Anton adds \n    2\n stones to\nthe third pile, which results in \n    5\n, \n    2\n, and \n    8\n. In the next\nturn, Harris chooses \n    3\n. Note that Anton cannot add the stones to the\nthird pile since he chose the third pile in the previous turn. Anton realizes\nthat he has no valid moves left and reluctantly recognizes Harris as the king.\n\n",
