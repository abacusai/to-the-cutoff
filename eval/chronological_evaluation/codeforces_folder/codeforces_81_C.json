        "description": "After the educational reform Polycarp studies only two subjects at school,\nSafety Studies and PE (Physical Education). During the long months of the\nfourth term, he received n marks in them. When teachers wrote a mark in the\njournal, they didn't write in what subject the mark was for, they just wrote\nthe mark. Now it's time to show the journal to his strict parents. Polycarp\nknows that recently at the Parent Meeting the parents were told that he\nreceived a Safety Studies marks and b PE marks (a + b = n). Now Polycarp wants\nto write a subject's name in front of each mark so that: there are exactly a\nSafety Studies marks, there are exactly b PE marks, the total average score in\nboth subjects is maximum. An average subject grade is the sum of all marks in\nit, divided by the number of them. Of course, the division is performed in\nreal numbers without rounding up or down. Polycarp aims to maximize the x1 +\nx2, where x1 is the average score in the first subject (Safety Studies), and\nx2 is the average score in the second one (Physical Education). Input The\nfirst line contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5), n is the number of marks in\nPolycarp's Journal. The second line contains two positive integers a, b (1 \u2264\na, b \u2264 n - 1, a + b = n). The third line contains a sequence of integers t1,\nt2, ..., tn (1 \u2264 ti \u2264 5), they are Polycarp's marks. Output Print the sequence\nof integers f1, f2, ..., fn, where fi (1 \u2264 fi \u2264 2) is the number of a subject\nto which the i-th mark should be attributed. If there are several possible\nsolutions, then print such that the sequence f1, f2, ..., fn is the smallest\nlexicographically. The sequence p1, p2, ..., pn is lexicographically less than\nq1, q2, ..., qn if there exists such j (1 \u2264 j \u2264 n) that pi = qi for all 1 \u2264 i\n< j, \u0430nd pj < qj. Examples Input 5 3 2 4 4 5 4 4 Output 1 1 2 1 2 Input 4 2 2\n3 5 4 5 Output 1 1 2 2 Input 6 1 5 4 4 4 5 4 4 Output 2 2 2 1 2 2 Note In the\nfirst sample the average score in the first subject is equal to 4, and in the\nsecond one \u2014 to 4.5. The total average score is 8.5.\n\n",
