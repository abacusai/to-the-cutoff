        "description": "There is a famous olympiad, which has more than a hundred participants. The\nOlympiad consists of two stages: the elimination stage, and the final stage.\nAt least a hundred participants will advance to the final stage. The\nelimination stage in turn consists of two contests. A result of the\nelimination stage is the total score in two contests, but, unfortunately, the\njury lost the final standings and has only standings for the first and for the\nsecond contest separately. In each contest, the participants are ranked by\ntheir point score in non-increasing order. When two participants have a tie\n(earned the same score), they are ranked by their passport number (in\naccordance with local regulations, all passport numbers are distinct). In the\nfirst contest, the participant on the 100-th place scored \n    a\n points.\nAlso, the jury checked all participants from the 1-st to the 100-th place\n(inclusive) in the first contest and found out that all of them have at least\n\n    b\n points in the second contest. Similarly, for the second contest, the\nparticipant on the 100-th place has \n    c\n points. And the jury checked that\nall the participants from the 1-st to the 100-th place (inclusive) have at\nleast \n    d\n points in the first contest. After two contests, all\nparticipants are ranked by their total score in two contests in non-increasing\norder. When participants have the same total score, tie-breaking with passport\nnumbers is used. The cutoff score to qualify to the final stage is the total\nscore of the participant on the 100-th place. Given integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n,\n\n    c\n, \n    d\n, please help the jury determine the smallest possible value\nof the cutoff score. Input You need to process \n    t\n test cases. The first\nline contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 3025\n) \u2014 the number\nof test cases. Then descriptions of \n    t\n test cases follow. The first line\nof each test case contains four integers \n    a\n, \n    b\n, \n    c\n, \n    d\n\n(\n    0 \n    \u2264 a,\n     b,\n     c,\n     d \n    \u2264 9\n; \n    d \n    \u2264 a\n; \n    b \n    \u2264\n    c\n). One can show that for any test case satisfying the constraints above,\nthere is at least one olympiad scenario possible. Output For each test case\nprint a single integer \u2014 the smallest possible cutoff score in some olympiad\nscenario satisfying the given information. Example Input 2 1 2 2 1 4 8 9 2\nOutput 3 12 Note For the first test case, consider the following olympiad\nscenario: there are \n    101\n participants in the elimination stage, each\nhaving \n    1\n point for the first contest and \n    2\n points for the second\ncontest. Hence the total score of the participant on the 100-th place is\n\n    3\n. For the second test case, consider the following olympiad scenario:\nthere are \n    50\n participants with points \n    5\n and \n    9\n for the first\nand second contest respectively; \n    50\n participants with points \n    4\n and\n\n    8\n for the first and second contest respectively; and \n    50\n\nparticipants with points \n    2\n and \n    9\n for the first and second contest\nrespectively. Hence the total point score of the participant on the 100-th\nplace is \n    12\n.\n\n",
