        "description": "Masha works in an advertising agency. In order to promote the new brand, she\nwants to conclude contracts with some bloggers. In total, Masha has\nconnections of \n    n\n different bloggers. Blogger numbered \n    i\n has\n\n    a_i\n followers. Since Masha has a limited budget, she can only sign a\ncontract with \n    k\n different bloggers. Of course, Masha wants her ad to be\nseen by as many people as possible. Therefore, she must hire bloggers with the\nmaximum total number of followers. Help her, find the number of ways to select\n\n    k\n bloggers so that the total number of their followers is maximum\npossible. Two ways are considered different if there is at least one blogger\nin the first way, which is not in the second way. Masha believes that all\nbloggers have different followers (that is, there is no follower who would\nfollow two different bloggers). For example, if \n    n=4\n, \n    k=3\n, \n    a=[1,\n    3, 1, 2]\n, then Masha has two ways to select \n    3\n bloggers with the\nmaximum total number of followers: conclude contracts with bloggers with\nnumbers \n    1\n, \n    2\n and \n    4\n. In this case, the number of followers\nwill be equal to \n    a_1 + a_2 + a_4 = 6\n. conclude contracts with bloggers\nwith numbers \n    2\n, \n    3\n and \n    4\n. In this case, the number of\nfollowers will be equal to \n    a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 6\n. Since the answer can be\nquite large, output it modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Input The first line contains one\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then\n\n    t\n test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two\nintegers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number\nof bloggers and how many of them you can sign a contract with. The second line\nof each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026 a_n\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the number of followers of each blogger. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    1000\n. Output For each test case, on a separate line output one integer \u2014\nthe number of ways to select \n    k\n bloggers so that the total number of\ntheir followers is maximum possible. Example Input 3 4 3 1 3 1 2 4 2 1 1 1 1 2\n1 1 2 Output 2 6 1 Note The test case is explained in the statements. In the\nsecond test case, the following ways are valid: conclude contracts with\nbloggers with numbers \n    1\n and \n    2\n. In this case, the number of\nfollowers will be equal to \n    a_1 + a_2 = 2\n; conclude contracts with\nbloggers with numbers \n    1\n and \n    3\n. In this case, the number of\nfollowers will be equal to \n    a_1 + a_3 = 2\n; conclude contracts with\nbloggers with numbers \n    1\n and \n    4\n. In this case, the number of\nfollowers will be equal to \n    a_1 + a_4 = 2\n; conclude contracts with\nbloggers with numbers \n    2\n and \n    3\n. In this case, the number of\nfollowers will be equal to \n    a_2 + a_3 = 2\n; conclude contracts with\nbloggers with numbers \n    2\n and \n    4\n. In this case, the number of\nfollowers will be equal to \n    a_2 + a_4 = 2\n; conclude contracts with\nbloggers with numbers \n    3\n and \n    4\n. In this case, the number of\nfollowers will be equal to \n    a_3 + a_4 = 2\n. In the third test case, the\nfollowing ways are valid: concludes a contract with a blogger with the number\n\n    2\n. In this case, the number of followers will be equal to \n    a_2 = 2\n.\n\n",
