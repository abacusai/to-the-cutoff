        "description": "Mr. Chanek has a new game called Dropping Balls. Initially, Mr. Chanek has a\ngrid \n    a\n of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n Each cell \n    (x,y)\n contains an\ninteger \n    a_x,y\n denoting the direction of how the ball will move.\n\n    a_x,y=1\n \u2014 the ball will move to the right (the next cell is \n    (x, y +\n    1)\n); \n    a_x,y=2\n \u2014 the ball will move to the bottom (the next cell is\n\n    (x + 1, y)\n); \n    a_x,y=3\n \u2014 the ball will move to the left (the next\ncell is \n    (x, y - 1)\n). Every time a ball leaves a cell \n    (x,y)\n, the\ninteger \n    a_x,y\n will change to \n    2\n. Mr. Chanek will drop \n    k\n\nballs sequentially, each starting from the first row, and on the \n    c_1, c_2,\n    \n    \u2026, c_k\n-th (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264 m\n) columns. Determine in which\ncolumn each ball will end up in (position of the ball after leaving the grid).\nInput The first line contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n, and \n    k\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 1000\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the size of\nthe grid and the number of balls dropped by Mr. Chanek. The \n    i\n-th of the\nnext \n    n\n lines contains \n    m\n integers\n\n    a_i,1,a_i,2,\n    \u2026,a_i,m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i,j\n    \u2264 3\n). It\nwill satisfy \n    a_i, 1\n     3\n and \n    a_i, m\n     1\n. The next line\ncontains \n    k\n integers \n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i\n    \n    \u2264 m\n) \u2014 the balls' column positions dropped by Mr. Chanek sequentially.\nOutput Output \n    k\n integers \u2014 the \n    i\n-th integer denoting the column\nwhere the \n    i\n-th ball will end. Examples Input 5 5 3 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 Output 2 2 1 Input 1 2 2 1 3 1 2 Output 1 2\nNote In the first example, the first ball will drop as follows. Note that the\ncell \n    (1, 1)\n will change direction to the bottom direction. The second\nand third balls will drop as follows. All balls will be dropped from the first\nrow and on the \n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_k\n-th columns respectively. A ball\nwill stop dropping once it leaves the grid.\n\n",
