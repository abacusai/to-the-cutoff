        "description": "There are n games in a football tournament. Three teams are participating in\nit. Currently k games had already been played. You are an avid football fan,\nbut recently you missed the whole k games. Fortunately, you remember a guess\nof your friend for these k games. Your friend did not tell exact number of\nwins of each team, instead he thought that absolute difference between number\nof wins of first and second team will be d1 and that of between second and\nthird team will be d2. You don't want any of team win the tournament, that is\neach team should have the same number of wins after n games. That's why you\nwant to know: does there exist a valid tournament satisfying the friend's\nguess such that no team will win this tournament? Note that outcome of a match\ncan not be a draw, it has to be either win or loss. Input The first line of\nthe input contains a single integer corresponding to number of test cases t (1\n\u2264 t \u2264 10^5). Each of the next t lines will contain four space-separated\nintegers n, k, d1, d2 (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^12; 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n; 0 \u2264 d1, d2 \u2264 k) \u2014 data for\nthe current test case. Output For each test case, output a single line\ncontaining either \"yes\" if it is possible to have no winner of tournament, or\n\"no\" otherwise (without quotes). Examples Input 5 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 6 4 1 0 6 3\n3 0 3 3 3 2 Output yes yes yes no no Note Sample 1. There has not been any\nmatch up to now (k = 0, d1 = 0, d2 = 0). If there will be three matches (1-2,\n2-3, 3-1) and each team wins once, then at the end each team will have 1 win.\nSample 2. You missed all the games (k = 3). As d1 = 0 and d2 = 0, and there is\na way to play three games with no winner of tournament (described in the\nprevious sample), the answer is \"yes\". Sample 3. You missed 4 matches, and d1\n= 1, d2 = 0. These four matches can be: 1-2 (win 2), 1-3 (win 3), 1-2 (win 1),\n1-3 (win 1). Currently the first team has 2 wins, the second team has 1 win,\nthe third team has 1 win. Two remaining matches can be: 1-2 (win 2), 1-3 (win\n3). In the end all the teams have equal number of wins (2 wins).\n\n",
