        "name": "Mashmokh and Water Tanks",
        "description": "Mashmokh is playing a new game. In the beginning he has k liters of water and\np coins. Additionally he has a rooted tree (an undirected connected acyclic\ngraph) that consists of m vertices. Each vertex of the tree contains a water\ntank that is empty in the beginning. The game begins with the fact that\nMashmokh chooses some (no more than k) of these tanks (except the root) and\npours into each of them exactly 1 liter of water. Then the following process\nis performed until there is no water remained in tanks. The process consists\nof several steps. At the beginning of each step Mashmokh opens doors of all\ntanks. Then Mashmokh closes doors of some tanks (he is not allowed to close\ndoor of tank in the root) for the duration of this move. Let's denote the\nnumber of liters in some tank with closed door as w, Mashmokh pays w coins for\nthe closing of that tank during this move. Let's denote by x1, x2, ..., xm as\nthe list of vertices of the tree sorted (nondecreasing) by their depth. The\nvertices from this list should be considered one by one in the order. Firstly\nvertex x1 (which is the root itself) is emptied. Then for each vertex xi (i >\n1), if its door is closed then skip the vertex else move all the water from\nthe tank of vertex xi to the tank of its father (even if the tank of the\nfather is closed). Suppose l moves were made until the tree became empty.\nLet's denote the amount of water inside the tank of the root after the i-th\nmove by wi then Mashmokh will win max(w1, w2, ..., wl) dollars. Mashmokh\nwanted to know what is the maximum amount of dollars he can win by playing the\nabove game. He asked you to find this value for him. Input The first line of\nthe input contains three space-separated integers m, k, p (2 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5; 0 \u2264\nk, p \u2264 10^9). Each of the following m - 1 lines contains two space-separated\nintegers ai, bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 m; ai \u2260 bi) \u2014 the edges of the tree. Consider\nthat the vertices of the tree are numbered from 1 to m. The root of the tree\nhas number 1. Output Output a single integer, the number Mashmokh asked you to\nfind. Examples Input 10 2 1 1 2 1 3 3 4 3 5 2 6 6 8 6 7 9 8 8 10 Output 2\nInput 5 1000 1000 1 2 1 3 3 4 3 5 Output 4 Note The tree in the first sample\nis shown on the picture below. The black, red, blue colors correspond to\nvertices with 0, 1, 2 liters of water. One way to achieve the maximum amount\nof money is to put 1 liter of water in each of vertices 3 and 4. The beginning\nstate is shown on the picture below. Then in the first move Mashmokh will pay\none token to close the door of the third vertex tank. The tree after the first\nmove is shown on the picture below. After the second move there are 2 liters\nof water in the root as shown on the picture below.\n\n",
