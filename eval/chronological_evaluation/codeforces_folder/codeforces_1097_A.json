        "name": "Gennady and a Card Game",
        "description": "Gennady owns a small hotel in the countryside where he lives a peaceful life.\nHe loves to take long walks, watch sunsets and play cards with tourists\nstaying in his hotel. His favorite game is called \"Mau-Mau\". To play Mau-Mau,\nyou need a pack of \n    52\n cards. Each card has a suit (Diamonds \u2014 D, Clubs \u2014\nC, Spades \u2014 S, or Hearts \u2014 H), and a rank (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K,\nor A). At the start of the game, there is one card on the table and you have\nfive cards in your hand. You can play a card from your hand if and only if it\nhas the same rank or the same suit as the card on the table. In order to check\nif you'd be a good playing partner, Gennady has prepared a task for you. Given\nthe card on the table and five cards in your hand, check if you can play at\nleast one card. Input The first line of the input contains one string which\ndescribes the card on the table. The second line contains five strings which\ndescribe the cards in your hand. Each string is two characters long. The first\ncharacter denotes the rank and belongs to the set \n    2, \n    \n    3, \n     4, \n     5, \n     6, \n     7, \n     8, \n     9, \n    \n    T, \n     J, \n     Q, \n     K, \n     A\n. The second character\ndenotes the suit and belongs to the set \n    D, \n     C, \n    \n    S, \n     H\n. All the cards in the input are different. Output If it\nis possible to play a card from your hand, print one word \"YES\". Otherwise,\nprint \"NO\". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower). Examples\nInput AS 2H 4C TH JH AD Output YES Input 2H 3D 4C AC KD AS Output NO Input 4D\nAS AC AD AH 5H Output YES Note In the first example, there is an Ace of Spades\n(AS) on the table. You can play an Ace of Diamonds (AD) because both of them\nare Aces. In the second example, you cannot play any card. In the third\nexample, you can play an Ace of Diamonds (AD) because it has the same suit as\na Four of Diamonds (4D), which lies on the table.\n\n",
