        "description": "Valera had an undirected connected graph without self-loops and multiple edges\nconsisting of n vertices. The graph had an interesting property: there were at\nmost k edges adjacent to each of its vertices. For convenience, we will assume\nthat the graph vertices were indexed by integers from 1 to n. One day Valera\ncounted the shortest distances from one of the graph vertices to all other\nones and wrote them out in array d. Thus, element d[i] of the array shows the\nshortest distance from the vertex Valera chose to vertex number i. Then\nsomething irreparable terrible happened. Valera lost the initial graph.\nHowever, he still has the array d. Help him restore the lost graph. Input The\nfirst line contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 \u2264 k < n \u2264 10^5).\nNumber n shows the number of vertices in the original graph. Number k shows\nthat at most k edges were adjacent to each vertex in the original graph. The\nsecond line contains space-separated integers d[1], d[2], ..., d[n] (0 \u2264 d[i]\n< n). Number d[i] shows the shortest distance from the vertex Valera chose to\nthe vertex number i. Output If Valera made a mistake in his notes and the\nrequired graph doesn't exist, print in the first line number -1. Otherwise, in\nthe first line print integer m (0 \u2264 m \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of edges in the\nfound graph. In each of the next m lines print two space-separated integers ai\nand bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264 n; ai \u2260 bi), denoting the edge that connects vertices\nwith numbers ai and bi. The graph shouldn't contain self-loops and multiple\nedges. If there are multiple possible answers, print any of them. Examples\nInput 3 2 0 1 1 Output 3 1 2 1 3 3 2 Input 4 2 2 0 1 3 Output 3 1 3 1 4 2 3\nInput 3 1 0 0 0 Output -1\n\n",
