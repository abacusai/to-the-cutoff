        "name": "The Game Of Parity",
        "description": "There are n cities in Westeros. The i-th city is inhabited by ai people.\nDaenerys and Stannis play the following game: in one single move, a player\nchooses a certain town and burns it to the ground. Thus all its residents,\nsadly, die. Stannis starts the game. The game ends when Westeros has exactly k\ncities left. The prophecy says that if the total number of surviving residents\nis even, then Daenerys wins: Stannis gets beheaded, and Daenerys rises on the\nIron Throne. If the total number of surviving residents is odd, Stannis wins\nand everything goes in the completely opposite way. Lord Petyr Baelish wants\nto know which candidates to the throne he should support, and therefore he\nwonders, which one of them has a winning strategy. Answer to this question of\nLord Baelish and maybe you will become the next Lord of Harrenholl. Input The\nfirst line contains two positive space-separated integers, n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n\n\u2264 2\u00b710^5) \u2014 the initial number of cities in Westeros and the number of cities\nat which the game ends. The second line contains n space-separated positive\nintegers ai (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 10^6), which represent the population of each city in\nWesteros. Output Print string \"Daenerys\" (without the quotes), if Daenerys\nwins and \"Stannis\" (without the quotes), if Stannis wins. Examples Input 3 1 1\n2 1 Output Stannis Input 3 1 2 2 1 Output Daenerys Input 6 3 5 20 12 7 14 101\nOutput Stannis Note In the first sample Stannis will use his move to burn a\ncity with two people and Daenerys will be forced to burn a city with one\nresident. The only survivor city will have one resident left, that is, the\ntotal sum is odd, and thus Stannis wins. In the second sample, if Stannis\nburns a city with two people, Daenerys burns the city with one resident, or\nvice versa. In any case, the last remaining city will be inhabited by two\npeople, that is, the total sum is even, and hence Daenerys wins.\n\n",
