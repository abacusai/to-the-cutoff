        "description": "One day Dima and Alex had an argument about the price and quality of laptops.\nDima thinks that the more expensive a laptop is, the better it is. Alex\ndisagrees. Alex thinks that there are two laptops, such that the price of the\nfirst laptop is less (strictly smaller) than the price of the second laptop\nbut the quality of the first laptop is higher (strictly greater) than the\nquality of the second laptop. Please, check the guess of Alex. You are given\ndescriptions of n laptops. Determine whether two described above laptops\nexist. Input The first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number\nof laptops. Next n lines contain two integers each, ai and bi (1 \u2264 ai, bi \u2264\nn), where ai is the price of the i-th laptop, and bi is the number that\nrepresents the quality of the i-th laptop (the larger the number is, the\nhigher is the quality). All ai are distinct. All bi are distinct. Output If\nAlex is correct, print \"Happy Alex\", otherwise print \"Poor Alex\" (without the\nquotes). Examples Input 2 1 2 2 1 Output Happy Alex\n\n",
