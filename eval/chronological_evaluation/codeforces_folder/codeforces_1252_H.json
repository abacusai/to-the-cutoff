        "description": "As you might already know, space has always been a problem in ICPC Jakarta. To\ncope with this, ICPC Jakarta is planning to build two new buildings. These\nbuildings should have a shape of a rectangle of the same size. Now, their\nproblem is to find land to build the buildings. There are \n    N\n lands\navailable for sale. The \n    i^th\n land has a rectangular shape of size\n\n    L_i \n    \u00d7 W_i\n. For a good feng shui, the building's side should be\nparallel to the land's sides. One way is to build the two buildings on two\ndifferent lands, one on each land (not necessarily with the same orientation).\nA building of size \n    A \n    \u00d7 B\n can be build on the \n    i^th\n land if\nand only if at least one of the following is satisfied: \n    A \n    \u2264 L_i\n and\n\n    B \n    \u2264 W_i\n, or \n    A \n    \u2264 W_i\n and \n    B \n    \u2264 L_i\n. Alternatively,\nit is also possible to build two buildings of \n    A \n    \u00d7 B\n on the\n\n    i^th\n land with the same orientation. Formally, it is possible to build\ntwo buildings of \n    A \n    \u00d7 B\n on the \n    i^th\n land if and only if at\nleast one of the following is satisfied: \n    A \n    \u00d7 2 \n    \u2264 L_i\n and \n    B\n    \n    \u2264 W_i\n, or \n    A \n    \u00d7 2 \n    \u2264 W_i\n and \n    B \n    \u2264 L_i\n, or \n    A\n    \n    \u2264 L_i\n and \n    B \n    \u00d7 2 \n    \u2264 W_i\n, or \n    A \n    \u2264 W_i\n and \n    B\n    \n    \u00d7 2 \n    \u2264 L_i\n. Your task in this problem is to help ICPC Jakarta to\nfigure out the largest possible buildings they can build given \n    N\n\navailable lands. Note that ICPC Jakarta has to build two buildings of \n    A\n    \n    \u00d7 B\n; output the largest possible for \n    A \n    \u00d7 B\n. Input Input\nbegins with a line containing an integer: \n    N\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264\n    100\n     000\n) representing the number of available lands. The next \n    N\n\nlines each contains two integers: \n    L_i\n \n    W_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 L_i, W_i\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n) representing the size of the land. Output Output in a line a\nnumber representing the largest building that ICPC Jakarta can build with\nexactly one decimal point (see sample input/output for clarity). Examples\nInput 2 5 5 3 4 Output 12.5 Input 2 2 5 4 3 Output 8.0 Input 3 10 1 9 8 7 6\nOutput 42.0 Note Explanation for the sample input/output #1 Two buildings of\n\n    2.5 \n    \u00d7 5\n can be built both on the first land. Explanation for the\nsample input/output #2 Two buildings of \n    2 \n    \u00d7 4\n can be built each\non the first and second lands. Explanation for the sample input/output #3 Two\nbuildings of \n    7 \n    \u00d7 6\n can be built each on the second and third\nlands.\n\n",
