        "name": "Road Optimization",
        "description": "The Government of Mars is not only interested in optimizing space flights, but\nalso wants to improve the road system of the planet. One of the most important\nhighways of Mars connects Olymp City and Kstolop, the capital of Cydonia. In\nthis problem, we only consider the way from Kstolop to Olymp City, but not the\nreverse path (i. e. the path from Olymp City to Kstolop). The road from\nKstolop to Olymp City is \n    \u2113\n kilometers long. Each point of the road\nhas a coordinate \n    x\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264\n    \u2113\n), which is equal to the\ndistance from Kstolop in kilometers. So, Kstolop is located in the point with\ncoordinate \n    0\n, and Olymp City is located in the point with coordinate\n\n    \u2113\n. There are \n    n\n signs along the road, \n    i\n-th of which sets\na speed limit \n    a_i\n. This limit means that the next kilometer must be\npassed in \n    a_i\n minutes and is active until you encounter the next along\nthe road. There is a road sign at the start of the road (i. e. in the point\nwith coordinate \n    0\n), which sets the initial speed limit. If you know the\nlocation of all the signs, it's not hard to calculate how much time it takes\nto drive from Kstolop to Olymp City. Consider an example: Here, you need to\ndrive the first three kilometers in five minutes each, then one kilometer in\neight minutes, then four kilometers in three minutes each, and finally the\nlast two kilometers must be passed in six minutes each. Total time is\n\n    3\n    \u00b7 5 + 1\n    \u00b7 8 + 4\n    \u00b7 3 + 2\n    \u00b7 6 = 47\n minutes. To\noptimize the road traffic, the Government of Mars decided to remove no more\nthan \n    k\n road signs. It cannot remove the sign at the start of the road,\notherwise, there will be no limit at the start. By removing these signs, the\nGovernment also wants to make the time needed to drive from Kstolop to Olymp\nCity as small as possible. The largest industrial enterprises are located in\nCydonia, so it's the priority task to optimize the road traffic from Olymp\nCity. So, the Government of Mars wants you to remove the signs in the way\ndescribed above. Input The first line contains three integers \n    n\n,\n\n    \u2113\n, \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 500\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264\n    \u2113\n    \u2264\n    10^5\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n-1\n), the amount of signs on the road, the\ndistance between the cities and the maximal number of signs you may remove.\nThe second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    d_i\n (\n    d_1 = 0\n, \n    d_i <\n    d_i+1\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 d_i \n    \u2264\n    \u2113 - 1\n) \u2014 coordinates of all signs.\nThe third line contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 speed limits. Output Print a single integer \u2014 minimal possible time\nto drive from Kstolop to Olymp City in minutes, if you remove no more than\n\n    k\n road signs. Examples Input 4 10 0 0 3 4 8 5 8 3 6 Output 47 Input 4 10\n2 0 3 4 8 5 8 3 6 Output 38 Note In the first example, you cannot remove the\nsigns. So the answer is \n    47\n, as it's said in the statements above. In the\nsecond example, you may remove the second and the fourth sign. In this case,\nyou need to drive four kilometers in \n    4\n    \u00b75 = 20\n minutes, and then\nsix kilometers in \n    6\n    \u00b73 = 18\n, so the total time is \n    4\n    \u00b75 +\n    6\n    \u00b73 = 38\n minutes.\n\n",
