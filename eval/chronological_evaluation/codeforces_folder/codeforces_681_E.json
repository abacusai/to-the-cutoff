        "description": "Dima is living in a dormitory, as well as some cockroaches. At the moment 0\nDima saw a cockroach running on a table and decided to kill it. Dima needs\nexactly T seconds for aiming, and after that he will precisely strike the\ncockroach and finish it. To survive the cockroach has to run into a shadow,\ncast by round plates standing on the table, in T seconds. Shadow casted by any\nof the plates has the shape of a circle. Shadow circles may intersect, nest or\noverlap arbitrarily. The cockroach uses the following strategy: first he\nequiprobably picks a direction to run towards and then runs towards it with\nthe constant speed v. If at some moment t \u2264 T it reaches any shadow circle, it\nimmediately stops in the shadow and thus will stay alive. Otherwise the\ncockroach is killed by the Dima's precise strike. Consider that the Dima's\nprecise strike is instant. Determine the probability of that the cockroach\nwill stay alive. Input In the first line of the input the four integers x0,\ny0, v, T (|x0|, |y0| \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 v, T \u2264 10^9) are given \u2014 the cockroach\ninitial position on the table in the Cartesian system at the moment 0, the\ncockroach's constant speed and the time in seconds Dima needs for aiming\nrespectively. In the next line the only number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) is given \u2014\nthe number of shadow circles casted by plates. In the next n lines shadow\ncircle description is given: the i^th of them consists of three integers xi,\nyi, ri (|xi|, |yi| \u2264 10^9, 0 \u2264 r \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the i^th shadow circle on-table\nposition in the Cartesian system and its radius respectively. Consider that\nthe table is big enough for the cockroach not to run to the table edges and\navoid Dima's precise strike. Output Print the only real number p \u2014 the\nprobability of that the cockroach will stay alive. Your answer will be\nconsidered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^-4.\nExamples Input 0 0 1 1 3 1 1 1 -1 -1 1 -2 2 1 Output 0.50000000000 Input 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1 Output 1.00000000000 Note The picture for the first sample is given\nbelow. Red color stands for points which being chosen as the cockroach's\nrunning direction will cause him being killed, green color for those standing\nfor survival directions. Please note that despite containing a circle centered\nin ( - 2, 2) a part of zone is colored red because the cockroach is not able\nto reach it in one second.\n\n",
