        "name": "Slava and tanks",
        "description": "Slava plays his favorite game \"Peace Lightning\". Now he is flying a bomber on\na very specific map. Formally, map is a checkered field of size 1 \u00d7 n, the\ncells of which are numbered from 1 to n, in each cell there can be one or\nseveral tanks. Slava doesn't know the number of tanks and their positions,\nbecause he flies very high, but he can drop a bomb in any cell. All tanks in\nthis cell will be damaged. If a tank takes damage for the first time, it\ninstantly moves to one of the neighboring cells (a tank in the cell n can only\nmove to the cell n - 1, a tank in the cell 1 can only move to the cell 2). If\na tank takes damage for the second time, it's counted as destroyed and never\nmoves again. The tanks move only when they are damaged for the first time,\nthey do not move by themselves. Help Slava to destroy all tanks using as few\nbombs as possible. Input The first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264\n100 000) \u2014 the size of the map. Output In the first line print m \u2014 the minimum\nnumber of bombs Slava needs to destroy all tanks. In the second line print m\nintegers k1, k2, ..., km. The number ki means that the i-th bomb should be\ndropped at the cell ki. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of\nthem. Examples Input 2 Output 3 2 1 2 Input 3 Output 4 2 1 3 2\n\n",
