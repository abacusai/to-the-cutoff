        "description": "You are given a tree (a connected undirected graph without cycles) of \n    n\n\nvertices. Each of the \n    n - 1\n edges of the tree is colored in either black\nor red. You are also given an integer \n    k\n. Consider sequences of \n    k\n\nvertices. Let's call a sequence \n    [a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_k]\n good if it\nsatisfies the following criterion: We will walk a path (possibly visiting same\nedge/vertex multiple times) on the tree, starting from \n    a_1\n and ending at\n\n    a_k\n. Start at \n    a_1\n, then go to \n    a_2\n using the shortest path\nbetween \n    a_1\n and \n    a_2\n, then go to \n    a_3\n in a similar way, and so\non, until you travel the shortest path between \n    a_k-1\n and \n    a_k\n. If\nyou walked over at least one black edge during this process, then the sequence\nis good. Consider the tree on the picture. If \n    k=3\n then the following\nsequences are good: \n    [1, 4, 7]\n, \n    [5, 5, 3]\n and \n    [2, 3, 7]\n. The\nfollowing sequences are not good: \n    [1, 4, 6]\n, \n    [5, 5, 5]\n, \n    [3, 7,\n    3]\n. There are \n    n^k\n sequences of vertices, count how many of them are\ngood. Since this number can be quite large, print it modulo \n    10^9+7\n.\nInput The first line contains two integers \n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n\n    \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    2 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 100\n), the size of the tree and the length\nof the vertex sequence. Each of the next \n    n - 1\n lines contains three\nintegers \n    u_i\n, \n    v_i\n and \n    x_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 u_i, v_i \n    \u2264 n\n,\n\n    x_i \n    \u2208\n    \n    0, 1\n), where \n    u_i\n and \n    v_i\n denote the\nendpoints of the corresponding edge and \n    x_i\n is the color of this edge\n(\n    0\n denotes red edge and \n    1\n denotes black edge). Output Print the\nnumber of good sequences modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Examples Input 4 4 1 2 1 2 3 1\n3 4 1 Output 252 Input 4 6 1 2 0 1 3 0 1 4 0 Output 0 Input 3 5 1 2 1 2 3 0\nOutput 210 Note In the first example, all sequences (\n    4^4\n) of length\n\n    4\n except the following are good: \n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n \n    [2, 2, 2, 2]\n\n\n    [3, 3, 3, 3]\n \n    [4, 4, 4, 4]\n In the second example, all edges are\nred, hence there aren't any good sequences.\n\n",
