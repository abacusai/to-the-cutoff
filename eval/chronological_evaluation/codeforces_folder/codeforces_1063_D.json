        "name": "Candies for Children",
        "description": "At the children's festival, children were dancing in a circle. When music\nstopped playing, the children were still standing in a circle. Then Lena\nremembered, that her parents gave her a candy box with exactly \n    k\n candies\n\"Wilky May\". Lena is not a greedy person, so she decided to present all her\ncandies to her friends in the circle. Lena knows, that some of her friends\nhave a sweet tooth and others do not. Sweet tooth takes out of the box two\ncandies, if the box has at least two candies, and otherwise takes one. The\nrest of Lena's friends always take exactly one candy from the box. Before\nstarting to give candies, Lena step out of the circle, after that there were\nexactly \n    n\n people remaining there. Lena numbered her friends in a\nclockwise order with positive integers starting with \n    1\n in such a way\nthat index \n    1\n was assigned to her best friend Roma. Initially, Lena gave\nthe box to the friend with number \n    l\n, after that each friend (starting\nfrom friend number \n    l\n) took candies from the box and passed the box to\nthe next friend in clockwise order. The process ended with the friend number\n\n    r\n taking the last candy (or two, who knows) and the empty box. Please\nnote that it is possible that some of Lena's friends took candy from the box\nseveral times, that is, the box could have gone several full circles before\nbecoming empty. Lena does not know which of her friends have a sweet tooth,\nbut she is interested in the maximum possible number of friends that can have\na sweet tooth. If the situation could not happen, and Lena have been proved\nwrong in her observations, please tell her about this. Input The only line\ncontains four integers \n    n\n, \n    l\n, \n    r\n and \n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, k\n    \n    \u2264 10^11\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 l, r \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the number of children in the\ncircle, the number of friend, who was given a box with candies, the number of\nfriend, who has taken last candy and the initial number of candies in the box\nrespectively. Output Print exactly one integer \u2014 the maximum possible number\nof sweet tooth among the friends of Lena or \"-1\" (quotes for clarity), if Lena\nis wrong. Examples Input 4 1 4 12 Output 2 Input 5 3 4 10 Output 3 Input 10 5\n5 1 Output 10 Input 5 4 5 6 Output -1 Note In the first example, any two\nfriends can be sweet tooths, this way each person will receive the box with\ncandies twice and the last person to take sweets will be the fourth friend. In\nthe second example, sweet tooths can be any three friends, except for the\nfriend on the third position. In the third example, only one friend will take\ncandy, but he can still be a sweet tooth, but just not being able to take two\ncandies. All other friends in the circle can be sweet tooths as well, they\njust will not be able to take a candy even once. In the fourth example, Lena\nis wrong and this situation couldn't happen.\n\n",
