        "description": "The new academic year has started, and Berland's university has \n    n\n first-\nyear students. They are divided into \n    k\n academic groups, however, some of\nthe groups might be empty. Among the students, there are \n    m\n pairs of\nacquaintances, and each acquaintance pair might be both in a common group or\nbe in two different groups. Alice is the curator of the first years, she wants\nto host an entertaining game to make everyone know each other. To do that, she\nwill select two different academic groups and then divide the students of\nthose groups into two teams. The game requires that there are no acquaintance\npairs inside each of the teams. Alice wonders how many pairs of groups she can\nselect, such that it'll be possible to play a game after that. All students of\nthe two selected groups must take part in the game. Please note, that the\nteams Alice will form for the game don't need to coincide with groups the\nstudents learn in. Moreover, teams may have different sizes (or even be\nempty). Input The first line contains three integers \n    n\n, \n    m\n and\n\n    k\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 500\n     000\n; \n    0 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 500\n     000\n;\n\n    2 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 500\n     000\n) \u2014 the number of students, the number of\npairs of acquaintances and the number of groups respectively. The second line\ncontains \n    n\n integers \n    c_1, c_2, \n    \u2026, c_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 c_i \n    \u2264\n    k\n), where \n    c_i\n equals to the group number of the \n    i\n-th student.\nNext \n    m\n lines follow. The \n    i\n-th of them contains two integers\n\n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264 n\n), denoting that\nstudents \n    a_i\n and \n    b_i\n are acquaintances. It's guaranteed, that\n\n    a_i \n    \u2260 b_i\n, and that no (unordered) pair is mentioned more than\nonce. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of ways to choose two\ndifferent groups such that it's possible to select two teams to play the game.\nExamples Input 6 8 3 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 3 1 5 1 6 2 5 2 6 3 4 3 5 5 6 Output 2\nInput 4 3 3 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 3 3 4 Output 3 Input 4 4 2 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 4\nOutput 0 Input 5 5 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 1 Output 0 Note The\nacquaintances graph for the first example is shown in the picture below (next\nto each student there is their group number written). In that test we can\nselect the following groups: Select the first and the second groups. For\ninstance, one team can be formed from students \n    1\n and \n    4\n, while\nother team can be formed from students \n    2\n and \n    3\n. Select the second\nand the third group. For instance, one team can be formed \n    3\n and \n    6\n,\nwhile other team can be formed from students \n    4\n and \n    5\n. We can't\nselect the first and the third group, because there is no way to form the\nteams for the game. In the second example, we can select any group pair.\nPlease note, that even though the third group has no students, we still can\nselect it (with some other group) for the game.\n\n",
