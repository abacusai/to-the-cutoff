        "description": "Do you like summer? Residents of Berland do. They especially love eating ice\ncream in the hot summer. So this summer day a large queue of n Berland\nresidents lined up in front of the ice cream stall. We know that each of them\nhas a certain amount of berland dollars with them. The residents of Berland\nare nice people, so each person agrees to swap places with the person right\nbehind him for just 1 dollar. More formally, if person a stands just behind\nperson b, then person a can pay person b 1 dollar, then a and b get swapped.\nOf course, if person a has zero dollars, he can not swap places with person b.\nResidents of Berland are strange people. In particular, they get upset when\nthere is someone with a strictly smaller sum of money in the line in front of\nthem. Can you help the residents of Berland form such order in the line so\nthat they were all happy? A happy resident is the one who stands first in the\nline or the one in front of who another resident stands with not less number\nof dollars. Note that the people of Berland are people of honor and they agree\nto swap places only in the manner described above. Input The first line\ncontains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000) \u2014 the number of residents who stand in\nthe line. The second line contains n space-separated integers ai (0 \u2264 ai \u2264\n10^9), where ai is the number of Berland dollars of a man standing on the i-th\nposition in the line. The positions are numbered starting from the end of the\nline. Output If it is impossible to make all the residents happy, print \":(\"\nwithout the quotes. Otherwise, print in the single line n space-separated\nintegers, the i-th of them must be equal to the number of money of the person\non position i in the new line. If there are multiple answers, print any of\nthem. Examples Input 2 11 8 Output 9 10 Input 5 10 9 7 10 6 Output :( Input 3\n12 3 3 Output 4 4 10 Note In the first sample two residents should swap\nplaces, after that the first resident has 10 dollars and he is at the head of\nthe line and the second resident will have 9 coins and he will be at the end\nof the line. In the second sample it is impossible to achieve the desired\nresult. In the third sample the first person can swap with the second one,\nthen they will have the following numbers of dollars: 4 11 3, then the second\nperson (in the new line) swaps with the third one, and the resulting numbers\nof dollars will equal to: 4 4 10. In this line everybody will be happy.\n\n",
