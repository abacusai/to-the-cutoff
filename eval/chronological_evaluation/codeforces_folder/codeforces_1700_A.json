        "description": "You are given a table \n    a\n of size \n    n \n    \u00d7 m\n. We will consider the\ntable rows numbered from top to bottom from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, and the\ncolumns numbered from left to right from \n    1\n to \n    m\n. We will denote a\ncell that is in the \n    i\n-th row and in the \n    j\n-th column as \n    (i,\n    j)\n. In the cell \n    (i, j)\n there is written a number \n    (i - 1) \n    \u00b7 m\n    + j\n, that is \n    a_ij = (i - 1) \n    \u00b7 m + j\n. A turtle initially\nstands in the cell \n    (1, 1)\n and it wants to come to the cell \n    (n, m)\n.\nFrom the cell \n    (i, j)\n it can in one step go to one of the cells \n    (i +\n    1, j)\n or \n    (i, j + 1)\n, if it exists. A path is a sequence of cells in\nwhich for every two adjacent in the sequence cells the following satisfies:\nthe turtle can reach from the first cell to the second cell in one step. A\ncost of a path is the sum of numbers that are written in the cells of the\npath. For example, with \n    n = 2\n and \n    m = 3\n the table will look as\nshown above. The turtle can take the following path: \n    (1, 1) \n    \u2192\n    (1, 2) \n    \u2192 (1, 3) \n    \u2192 (2, 3)\n. The cost of such way is\nequal to \n    a_11 + a_12 + a_13 + a_23 = 12\n. On the other hand, the\npaths \n    (1, 1) \n    \u2192 (1, 2) \n    \u2192 (2, 2) \n    \u2192 (2,\n    1)\n and \n    (1, 1) \n    \u2192 (1, 3)\n are incorrect, because in the\nfirst path the turtle can't make a step \n    (2, 2) \n    \u2192 (2, 1)\n, and\nin the second path it can't make a step \n    (1, 1) \n    \u2192 (1, 3)\n. You\nare asked to tell the turtle a minimal possible cost of a path from the cell\n\n    (1, 1)\n to the cell \n    (n, m)\n. Please note that the cells \n    (1, 1)\n\nand \n    (n, m)\n are a part of the way. Input The first line contains a single\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The\ndescription of test cases follows. A single line of each test case contains\ntwo integers \n    n\n and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n, m \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the\nnumber of rows and columns of the table \n    a\n respectively. Output For each\ntest case output a single integer \u2014 a minimal possible cost of a path from the\ncell \n    (1, 1)\n to the cell \n    (n, m)\n. Example Input 7 1 1 2 3 3 2 7 1 1\n10 5 5 10000 10000 Output 1 12 13 28 55 85 500099995000 Note In the first test\ncase the only possible path consists of a single cell \n    (1, 1)\n. The path\nwith the minimal cost in the second test case is shown in the statement. In\nthe fourth and the fifth test cases there is only one path from \n    (1, 1)\n\nto \n    (n, m)\n. Both paths visit every cell in the table.\n\n",
