        "description": "The polar bears are going fishing. They plan to sail from (sx, sy) to (ex,\ney). However, the boat can only sail by wind. At each second, the wind blows\nin one of these directions: east, south, west or north. Assume the boat is\ncurrently at (x, y). If the wind blows to the east, the boat will move to (x +\n1, y). If the wind blows to the south, the boat will move to (x, y - 1). If\nthe wind blows to the west, the boat will move to (x - 1, y). If the wind\nblows to the north, the boat will move to (x, y + 1). Alternatively, they can\nhold the boat by the anchor. In this case, the boat stays at (x, y). Given the\nwind direction for t seconds, what is the earliest time they sail to (ex, ey)?\nInput The first line contains five integers t, sx, sy, ex, ey (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^5, -\n10^9 \u2264 sx, sy, ex, ey \u2264 10^9). The starting location and the ending location\nwill be different. The second line contains t characters, the i-th character\nis the wind blowing direction at the i-th second. It will be one of the four\npossibilities: \"E\" (east), \"S\" (south), \"W\" (west) and \"N\" (north). Output If\nthey can reach (ex, ey) within t seconds, print the earliest time they can\nachieve it. Otherwise, print \"-1\" (without quotes). Examples Input 5 0 0 1 1\nSESNW Output 4 Input 10 5 3 3 6 NENSWESNEE Output -1 Note In the first sample,\nthey can stay at seconds 1, 3, and move at seconds 2, 4. In the second sample,\nthey cannot sail to the destination.\n\n",
