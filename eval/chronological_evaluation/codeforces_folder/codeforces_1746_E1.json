        "description": "The only difference between this problem and the hard version is the maximum\nnumber of questions. This is an interactive problem. There is a hidden integer\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 n\n which you have to find. In order to find it you can\nask at most \n    82\n questions. In each question you can choose a\nnon-empty integer set \n    S\n and ask if \n    x\n belongs to \n    S\n or not,\nafter each question, if \n    x\n belongs to \n    S\n, you'll receive \"YES\",\notherwise \"NO\". But the problem is that not all answers are necessarily true\n(some of them are joking), it's just guaranteed that for each two consecutive\nquestions, at least one of them is answered correctly. Additionally to the\nquestions, you can make at most \n    2\n guesses for the answer \n    x\n. Each\ntime you make a guess, if you guess \n    x\n correctly, you receive \":)\" and\nyour program should terminate, otherwise you'll receive \":(\". As a part of the\njoking, we will not fix the value of \n    x\n in the beginning. Instead, it can\nchange throughout the interaction as long as all the previous responses are\nvalid as described above. Note that your answer guesses are always answered\ncorrectly. If you ask a question before and after a guess, at least one of\nthese two questions is answered correctly, as normal. Input The only line of\nthe input contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n), the\nmaximum possible value of \n    x\n. Interaction For each question, if you want\nto ask about a set \n    S\n, first print the character '?', then print the size\nof \n    S\n and then print the elements of \n    S\n one by one. Each element\nshould be an integer between \n    1\n and \n    n\n, the elements must be\ndistinct. After each question, read a string \"YES\" or \"NO\", as explained in\nthe statement. You can make at most \n    82\n such questions. If you want to\nguess for \n    x\n, first print the character '!' and then print your guess.\nAfter each guess, read \":)\" or \":(\". If you guess \n    x\n correctly, the\nanswer is \":)\" and your program should terminate immediately, otherwise you'll\nreceive \":(\". You can make at most \n    2\n such guesses. After printing a\nquery do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you\nwill get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use: fflush(stdout) or\ncout.flush() in C++; System.out.flush() in Java; flush(output) in Pascal;\nstdout.flush() in Python; see documentation for other languages. Hacking is\nnot allowed in this problem. Example Input 6 NO :( NO :) Output ? 5 1 2 5 4 3\n! 6 ? 4 1 2 3 4 ! 5 Note If the answer of the first question were correct,\nthen \n    x\n would have been equal to \n    6\n, but as we can see in the first\nguess, \n    6\n is not the answer. So the answer of the first question is\njoking. As we know, the answer of at least one of our two questions is\ncorrect, since the answer of the first question was joking, the answer of the\nsecond question should be correct. So we will understand that \n    x\n is not\nequal to \n    1, 2, 3\n or \n    4\n, and we also knew that \n    x\n is not equal\nto \n    6\n either. Hence \n    x\n should be equal to \n    5\n.\n\n",
