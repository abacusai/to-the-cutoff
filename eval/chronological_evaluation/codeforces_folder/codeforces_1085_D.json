        "name": "Minimum Diameter Tree",
        "description": "You are given a tree (an undirected connected graph without cycles) and an\ninteger \n    s\n. Vanya wants to put weights on all edges of the tree so that\nall weights are non-negative real numbers and their sum is \n    s\n. At the\nsame time, he wants to make the diameter of the tree as small as possible.\nLet's define the diameter of a weighed tree as the maximum sum of the weights\nof the edges lying on the path between two some vertices of the tree. In other\nwords, the diameter of a weighed tree is the length of the longest simple path\nin the tree, where length of a path is equal to the sum of weights over all\nedges in the path. Find the minimum possible diameter that Vanya can get.\nInput The first line contains two integer numbers \n    n\n and \n    s\n (\n    2\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 s \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of\nvertices in the tree and the sum of edge weights. Each of the following\n\n    n\u22121\n lines contains two space-separated integer numbers \n    a_i\n and\n\n    b_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i, b_i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    a_i \n    \u2260 b_i\n) \u2014 the\nindexes of vertices connected by an edge. The edges are undirected. It is\nguaranteed that the given edges form a tree. Output Print the minimum diameter\nof the tree that Vanya can get by placing some non-negative real weights on\nits edges with the sum equal to \n    s\n. Your answer will be considered\ncorrect if its absolute or relative error does not exceed \n    10^-6\n.\nFormally, let your answer be \n    a\n, and the jury's answer be \n    b\n. Your\nanswer is considered correct if \n    |a-b|/max(1, b)\n    \u2264\n    10^-6\n. Examples Input 4 3 1 2 1 3 1 4 Output 2.000000000000000000 Input 6\n1 2 1 2 3 2 5 5 4 5 6 Output 0.500000000000000000 Input 5 5 1 2 2 3 3 4 3 5\nOutput 3.333333333333333333 Note In the first example it is necessary to put\nweights like this: It is easy to see that the diameter of this tree is\n\n    2\n. It can be proved that it is the minimum possible diameter. In the\nsecond example it is necessary to put weights like this:\n\n",
