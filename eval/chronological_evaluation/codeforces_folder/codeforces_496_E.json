        "description": "You are an assistant director in a new musical play. The play consists of n\nmusical parts, each part must be performed by exactly one actor. After the\ncasting the director chose m actors who can take part in the play. Your task\nis to assign the parts to actors. However, there are several limitations.\nFirst, each actor has a certain voice range and there are some parts that he\ncannot sing. Formally, there are two integers for each actor, ci and di (ci \u2264\ndi) \u2014 the pitch of the lowest and the highest note that the actor can sing.\nThere also are two integers for each part \u2014 aj and bj (aj \u2264 bj) \u2014 the pitch of\nthe lowest and the highest notes that are present in the part. The i-th actor\ncan perform the j-th part if and only if ci \u2264 aj \u2264 bj \u2264 di, i.e. each note of\nthe part is in the actor's voice range. According to the contract, the i-th\nactor can perform at most ki parts. Besides, you are allowed not to give any\npart to some actors (then they take part in crowd scenes). The rehearsal\nstarts in two hours and you need to do the assignment quickly! Input The first\nline contains a single integer n \u2014 the number of parts in the play (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n10^5). Next n lines contain two space-separated integers each, aj and bj \u2014 the\nrange of notes for the j-th part (1 \u2264 aj \u2264 bj \u2264 10^9). The next line contains\na single integer m \u2014 the number of actors (1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5). Next m lines contain\nthree space-separated integers each, ci, di and ki \u2014 the range of the i-th\nactor and the number of parts that he can perform (1 \u2264 ci \u2264 di \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 ki\n\u2264 10^9). Output If there is an assignment that meets all the criteria aboce,\nprint a single word \"YES\" (without the quotes) in the first line. In the next\nline print n space-separated integers. The i-th integer should be the number\nof the actor who should perform the i-th part. If there are multiple correct\nassignments, print any of them. If there is no correct assignment, print a\nsingle word \"NO\" (without the quotes). Examples Input 3 1 3 2 4 3 5 2 1 4 2 2\n5 1 Output YES 1 1 2 Input 3 1 3 2 4 3 5 2 1 3 2 2 5 1 Output NO\n\n",
