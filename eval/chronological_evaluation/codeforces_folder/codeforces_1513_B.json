        "description": "A sequence of \n    n\n non-negative integers (\n    n \n    \u2265 2\n) \n    a_1, a_2,\n    \n    \u2026, a_n\n is called good if for all \n    i\n from \n    1\n to \n    n-1\n\nthe following condition holds true: \n    \n\n    a_1 \n     \n    &\n      a_2 \n     \n    &\n     \n    \u2026\n     \n    &\n      a_i = a_i+1\n     \n    &\n      a_i+2\n     \n    &\n     \n    \u2026\n     \n    &\n      a_n,\n\n    \n where \n    &\n denotes the bitwise\nAND operation. You are given an array \n    a\n of size \n    n\n (\n    n \n    \u2265\n    2\n). Find the number of permutations \n    p\n of numbers ranging from \n    1\n\nto \n    n\n, for which the sequence \n    a_p_1\n, \n    a_p_2\n, ...\n,\n    a_p_n\n is good. Since this number can be large, output it modulo\n\n    10^9+7\n. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n), denoting the number of test cases. The first line of\neach test case contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the size of the array. The second line of each test case contains\n\n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n)\n\u2014 the elements of the array. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all\ntest cases doesn't exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output Output \n    t\n lines,\nwhere the \n    i\n-th line contains the number of good permutations in the\n\n    i\n-th test case modulo \n    10^9 + 7\n. Example Input 4 3 1 1 1 5 1 2 3 4\n5 5 0 2 0 3 0 4 1 3 5 1 Output 6 0 36 4 Note In the first test case, since all\nthe numbers are equal, whatever permutation we take, the sequence is good.\nThere are a total of \n    6\n permutations possible with numbers from \n    1\n\nto \n    3\n: \n    [1,2,3]\n, \n    [1,3,2]\n, \n    [2,1,3]\n, \n    [2,3,1]\n,\n\n    [3,1,2]\n, \n    [3,2,1]\n. In the second test case, it can be proved that\nno permutation exists for which the sequence is good. In the third test case,\nthere are a total of \n    36\n permutations for which the sequence is good. One\nof them is the permutation \n    [1,5,4,2,3]\n which results in the sequence\n\n    s=[0,0,3,2,0]\n. This is a good sequence because \n    s_1 = s_2 \n     \n    &\n      s_3 \n     \n    &\n      s_4 \n     \n    &\n      s_5 = 0\n, \n    s_1 \n     \n    &\n     \n    s_2 = s_3 \n     \n    &\n      s_4 \n     \n    &\n      s_5 = 0\n, \n    s_1 \n     \n    &\n     \n    s_2 \n     \n    &\n      s_3 = s_4 \n     \n    &\n      s_5 = 0\n, \n    s_1 \n     \n    &\n     \n    s_2 \n     \n    &\n      s_3 \n     \n    &\n      s_4 = s_5 = 0\n.\n\n",
