        "description": "One day a highly important task was commissioned to Vasya \u2014 writing a program\nin a night. The program consists of n lines of code. Vasya is already\nexhausted, so he works like that: first he writes v lines of code, drinks a\ncup of tea, then he writes as much as lines, drinks another cup of tea, then\nhe writes lines and so on: , , , ... The expression is regarded as the\nintegral part from dividing number a by number b. The moment the current value\nequals 0, Vasya immediately falls asleep and he wakes up only in the morning,\nwhen the program should already be finished. Vasya is wondering, what minimum\nallowable value v can take to let him write not less than n lines of code\nbefore he falls asleep. Input The input consists of two integers n and k,\nseparated by spaces \u2014 the size of the program in lines and the productivity\nreduction coefficient, 1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9, 2 \u2264 k \u2264 10. Output Print the only integer\n\u2014 the minimum value of v that lets Vasya write the program in one night.\nExamples Input 7 2 Output 4 Input 59 9 Output 54 Note In the first sample the\nanswer is v = 4. Vasya writes the code in the following portions: first 4\nlines, then 2, then 1, and then Vasya falls asleep. Thus, he manages to write\n4 + 2 + 1 = 7 lines in a night and complete the task. In the second sample the\nanswer is v = 54. Vasya writes the code in the following portions: 54, 6. The\ntotal sum is 54 + 6 = 60, that's even more than n = 59.\n\n",
