        "name": "Salazar Slytherin's Locket",
        "description": "Harry came to know from Dumbledore that Salazar Slytherin's locket is a\nhorcrux. This locket was present earlier at 12 Grimmauld Place, the home of\nSirius Black's mother. It was stolen from there and is now present in the\nMinistry of Magic in the office of Dolorous Umbridge, Harry's former Defense\nAgainst the Dark Arts teacher. Harry, Ron and Hermione are infiltrating the\nMinistry. Upon reaching Umbridge's office, they observed a code lock with a\npuzzle asking them to calculate count of magic numbers between two integers l\nand r (both inclusive). Harry remembered from his detention time with Umbridge\nthat she defined a magic number as a number which when converted to a given\nbase b, all the digits from 0 to b - 1 appear even number of times in its\nrepresentation without any leading zeros. You have to answer q queries to\nunlock the office. Each query has three integers bi, li and ri, the base and\nthe range for which you have to find the count of magic numbers. Input First\nline of input contains q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 10^5) \u2014 number of queries. Each of the next\nq lines contain three space separated integers bi, li, ri (2 \u2264 bi \u2264 10, 1 \u2264 li\n\u2264 ri \u2264 10^18). Output You have to output q lines, each containing a single\ninteger, the answer to the corresponding query. Examples Input 2 2 4 9 3 1 10\nOutput 1 2 Input 2 2 1 100 5 1 100 Output 21 4 Note In sample test case 1, for\nfirst query, when we convert numbers 4 to 9 into base 2, we get: 4 = 1002, 5 =\n1012, 6 = 1102, 7 = 1112, 8 = 10002, 9 = 10012. Out of these, only base 2\nrepresentation of 9 has even number of 1 and 0. Thus, the answer is 1.\n\n",
