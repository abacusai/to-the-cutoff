        "description": "This is an interactive problem. Your goal is to find a circle on a plane by\nshooting rays and getting the distance to the circle as a result. Interactor\nhas three hidden integer parameters that are determined in advance for each\ntest, but which you don't know \u2014 \n    x_c\n, \n    y_c\n, and \n    r_c\n. \n    (x_c,\n    y_c)\n are coordinates of the circle's center and \n    r_c\n is its radius.\nThe absolute values of \n    x_c\n, \n    y_c\n, and \n    r_c\n do not exceed\n\n    10^5\n, and \n    1 \n    \u2264 r_c \n    \u2264\n    \u221a(x_c^2 + y_c^2) - 1\n. You can\nshoot rays that extend from the origin \n    (0,0)\n and go via a point\n\n    (x_q,y_q)\n with the integer coordinates you specify. For each ray, you\nget a distance from the ray to the circle or \n    0\n if the ray intersects the\ncircle. Interaction The interaction starts with your program printing a query\nto the standard output and finishes when your program finds and prints the\nanswer to the problem. Each query has a form of \"? \n    x_q\n \n    y_q\n\", where\n\n    x_q\n and \n    y_q\n are integers (\n    |x_q|, |y_q| \n    \u2264 10^6\n; \n    x_q\n    \n     0\n or \n    y_q \n     0\n). The interactor outputs a line with a single\nfloating-point number \u2014 the distance between a query ray and a circle that is\nprecise to \n    10^-10\n by an absolute value. Your program can make the next\nquery, read the output, and so on. You are allowed to do at most \n    60\n\nqueries. At the end of the interaction, print the answer line \"! \n    x_c\n\n\n    y_c\n \n    r_c\n\", flush the output and exit. Note, that the output of the\ninteractor is actually rounded to the 10-th digit after a decimal point, so if\nyou are stress-testing your solution locally, make sure that you also perform\nthe corresponding rounding.
