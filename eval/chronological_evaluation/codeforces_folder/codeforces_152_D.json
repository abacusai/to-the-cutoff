        "description": "One day Vasya got hold of a sheet of checkered paper n \u00d7 m squares in size.\nOur Vasya adores geometrical figures, so he painted two rectangles on the\npaper. The rectangles' sides are parallel to the coordinates' axes, also the\nlength of each side of each rectangle is no less than 3 squares and the sides\nare painted by the grid lines. The sides can also be part of the sheet of\npaper's edge. Then Vasya hatched all squares on the rectangles' frames. Let's\ndefine a rectangle's frame as the set of squares inside the rectangle that\nshare at least one side with its border. A little later Vasya found a sheet of\npaper of exactly the same size and couldn't guess whether it is the same sheet\nof paper or a different one. So, he asked you to check whether the sheet of\npaper he had found contains two painted frames and nothing besides them.\nPlease note that the frames painted by Vasya can arbitrarily intersect,\noverlap or even completely coincide. The coordinates on the sheet of paper are\nintroduced in such a way that the X axis goes from top to bottom, the x\ncoordinates of the squares' numbers take values from 1 to n and the Y axis\ngoes from the left to the right and the y coordinates of the squares' numbers\ntake values from 1 to m. Input The first input line contains two integers n\nand m (3 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1000) \u2014 the sizes of the sheet of paper Vasya found. Next n\nlines, each consisting of m symbols \".\" (dot) and \"#\" (number sign), describe\nthe found sheet of paper. The symbol \"#\" represents a hatched square and the\nsymbol \".\" represents a non-hatched square. Output In the first line print the\nsingle word \"YES\" or \"NO\", meaning whether it is true that the found sheet of\npaper has two frames painted on it. If the answer is positive, then print in\nthe second line 4 integers: the coordinates of the upper left and lower right\ncorners of the first frame. In the third line print 4 integers: the\ncoordinates of the upper left and the lower right corners of the second frame.\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them. Examples Input 4 5 #####\n#.#.# ###.# ##### Output YES 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 5 Input 5 6 ...### ...### #####.\n#...#. #####. Output NO Note In the first sample there are two frames on the\npicture. The first one is: ###.. #.#.. ###.. ..... The second one is: #####\n#...# #...# ##### In the second sample the painted figures are not frames.\nNote that the height and width of valid frames is no less than 3.\n\n",
