        "description": "One day Natalia was walking in the woods when she met a little mushroom gnome.\nThe gnome told her the following story: Everybody knows that the mushroom\ngnomes' power lies in the magic mushrooms that grow in the native woods of the\ngnomes. There are n trees and m magic mushrooms in the woods: the i-th tree\ngrows at a point on a straight line with coordinates ai and has the height of\nhi, the j-th mushroom grows at the point with coordinates bj and has magical\npowers zj. But one day wild mushroommunchers, the sworn enemies of mushroom\ngnomes unleashed a terrible storm on their home forest. As a result, some of\nthe trees began to fall and crush the magic mushrooms. The supreme oracle of\nmushroom gnomes calculated in advance the probability for each tree that it\nwill fall to the left, to the right or will stand on. If the tree with the\ncoordinate x and height h falls to the left, then all the mushrooms that\nbelong to the right-open interval [x - h, x), are destroyed. If a tree falls\nto the right, then the mushrooms that belong to the left-open interval (x, x +\nh] are destroyed. Only those mushrooms that are not hit by a single tree\nsurvive. Knowing that all the trees fall independently of each other (i.e.,\nall the events are mutually independent, and besides, the trees do not\ninterfere with other trees falling in an arbitrary direction), the supreme\noracle was also able to quickly calculate what would be the expectation of the\ntotal power of the mushrooms which survived after the storm. His calculations\nultimately saved the mushroom gnomes from imminent death. Natalia, as a good\nOlympiad programmer, got interested in this story, and she decided to come up\nwith a way to quickly calculate the expectation of the sum of the surviving\nmushrooms' power. Input The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n \u2264\n10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of trees and mushrooms, respectively. Each of\nthe next n lines contain four integers \u2014 ai, hi, li, ri (|ai| \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 hi \u2264\n10^9, 0 \u2264 li, ri, li + ri \u2264 100) which represent the coordinate of the i-th\ntree, its height, the percentage of the probabilities that the tree falls to\nthe left and to the right, respectively (the remaining percentage is the\nprobability that the tree will stand on). Each of next m lines contain two\nintegers bj, zj (|bj| \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 zj \u2264 10^3) which represent the coordinate\nand the magical power of the j-th mushroom, respectively. An arbitrary number\nof trees and mushrooms can grow in one point. Output Print a real number \u2014 the\nexpectation of the total magical power of the surviving mushrooms. The result\nis accepted with relative or absolute accuracy 10^-4. Examples Input 1 1 2 2\n50 50 1 1 Output 0.5000000000 Input 2 1 2 2 50 50 4 2 50 50 3 1 Output\n0.2500000000 Note It is believed that the mushroom with the coordinate x\nbelongs to the right-open interval [l, r) if and only if l \u2264 x < r. Similarly,\nthe mushroom with the coordinate x belongs to the left-open interval (l, r] if\nand only if l < x \u2264 r. In the first test the mushroom survives with the\nprobability of 50\ntest the mushroom survives only if neither of the two trees falls on it. It\noccurs with the probability of 50\nwith 10^5 trees and one mushroom.\n\n",
