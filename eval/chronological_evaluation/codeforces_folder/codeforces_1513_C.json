        "description": "You are given an integer \n    n\n. You have to apply \n    m\n operations to it.\nIn a single operation, you must replace every digit \n    d\n of the number with\nthe decimal representation of integer \n    d + 1\n. For example, \n    1912\n\nbecomes \n    21023\n after applying the operation once. You have to find the\nlength of \n    n\n after applying \n    m\n operations. Since the answer can be\nvery large, print it modulo \n    10^9+7\n. Input The first line contains a\nsingle integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of\ntest cases. The only line of each test case contains two integers \n    n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^9\n) and \n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7\n    10^5\n) \u2014 the initial number and the number of operations. Output For each\ntest case output the length of the resulting number modulo \n    10^9+7\n.\nExample Input 5 1912 1 5 6 999 1 88 2 12 100 Output 5 2 6 4 2115 Note For the\nfirst test, \n    1912\n becomes \n    21023\n after \n    1\n operation which is of\nlength \n    5\n. For the second test, \n    5\n becomes \n    21\n after \n    6\n\noperations which is of length \n    2\n. For the third test, \n    999\n becomes\n\n    101010\n after \n    1\n operation which is of length \n    6\n. For the\nfourth test, \n    88\n becomes \n    1010\n after \n    2\n operations which is of\nlength \n    4\n.\n\n",
