        "description": "Two T-shirt sizes are given: \n    a\n and \n    b\n. The T-shirt size is either a\nstring M or a string consisting of several (possibly zero) characters X and\none of the characters S or L. For example, strings M, XXL, S, XXXXXXXS could\nbe the size of some T-shirts. And the strings XM, LL, SX are not sizes. The\nletter M stands for medium, S for small, L for large. The letter X refers to\nthe degree of size (from eXtra). For example, XXL is extra-extra-large (bigger\nthan XL, and smaller than XXXL). You need to compare two given sizes of\nT-shirts \n    a\n and \n    b\n. The T-shirts are compared as follows: any small\nsize (no matter how many letters X) is smaller than the medium size and any\nlarge size; any large size (regardless of the number of letters X) is larger\nthan the medium size and any small size; the more letters X before S, the\nsmaller the size; the more letters X in front of L, the larger the size. For\nexample: XXXS < XS XXXL > XL XL > M XXL = XXL XXXXXS < M XL > XXXS Input The\nfirst line of the input contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264\n    10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line, in\nwhich \n    a\n and \n    b\n T-shirt sizes are written. The lengths of the\nstrings corresponding to the T-shirt sizes do not exceed \n    50\n. It is\nguaranteed that all sizes are correct. Output For each test case, print on a\nseparate line the result of comparing \n    a\n and \n    b\n T-shirt sizes (lines\n\"<\", \">\" or \"=\" without quotes). Example Input 6 XXXS XS XXXL XL XL M XXL XXL\nXXXXXS M L M Output < > > = < >\n\n",
