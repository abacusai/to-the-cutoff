        "description": "Stepan has a set of n strings. Also, he has a favorite string s. Stepan wants\nto do the following. He will take some strings of his set and write them down\none after another. It is possible that he will take some strings more than\nonce, and will not take some of them at all. Your task is to determine the\nminimum number of strings in the set which Stepan needs to take and write so\nthat the string s appears as a subsequence in the resulting written down\nstring. For example, in the string \"abcd\" strings \"ad\", \"acd\", \"abcd\" appear\nas subsequences, and strings \"ba\", \"abdc\" don't appear as subsequences. Input\nThe first line contains the integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 50) \u2014 the number of strings in\nStepan's set. The next n lines contain n non-empty strings consisting of\nlowercase letters of the English alphabet. The length of each of these strings\ndoes not exceed 50 symbols. It is possible that some strings from Stepan's set\nare the same. The next line contains the non-empty string s, consisting of\nlowercase letters of the English alphabet \u2014 Stepan's favorite string. The\nlength of this string doesn't exceed 2500 symbols. Output Print the minimum\nnumber of strings which Stepan should take from the set and write them down\none after another so that the string s appears as a subsequence in the\nresulting written down string. Each string from the set should be counted as\nmany times as Stepan takes it from the set. If the answer doesn't exsist,\nprint -1. Examples Input 3 a aa a aaa Output 2 Input 4 ab aab aa bb baaab\nOutput 3 Input 2 aaa bbb aaacbbb Output -1 Note In the first test, Stepan can\ntake, for example, the third and the second strings from the set, write them\ndown, and get exactly his favorite string. In the second example Stepan can\ntake, for example, the second, the third and again the second strings from the\nset and write them down. Then he will get a string \"aabaaaab\", in which his\nfavorite string \"baaab\" is a subsequence. In the third test Stepan can not get\nhis favorite string, because it contains the letter \"c\", which is not\npresented in any of the strings in the set.\n\n",
