        "description": "Heidi and Doctor Who hopped out of the TARDIS and found themselves at EPFL in\n2018. They were surrounded by stormtroopers and Darth Vader was approaching.\nMiraculously, they managed to escape to a nearby rebel base but the Doctor was\nvery confused. Heidi reminded him that last year's HC2 theme was Star Wars.\nNow he understood, and he's ready to face the evils of the Empire! The rebels\nhave \n    s\n spaceships, each with a certain attacking power \n    a\n. They\nwant to send their spaceships to destroy the empire bases and steal enough\ngold and supplies in order to keep the rebellion alive. The empire has \n    b\n\nbases, each with a certain defensive power \n    d\n, and a certain amount of\ngold \n    g\n. A spaceship can attack all the bases which have a defensive\npower less than or equal to its attacking power. If a spaceship attacks a\nbase, it steals all the gold in that base. The rebels are still undecided\nwhich spaceship to send out first, so they asked for the Doctor's help. They\nwould like to know, for each spaceship, the maximum amount of gold it can\nsteal. Input The first line contains integers \n    s\n and \n    b\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    s, b \n    \u2264 10^5\n), the number of spaceships and the number of bases,\nrespectively. The second line contains \n    s\n integers \n    a\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 a\n    \n    \u2264 10^9\n), the attacking power of each spaceship. The next \n    b\n lines\ncontain integers \n    d, g\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 d \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    0 \n    \u2264 g\n    \n    \u2264 10^4\n), the defensive power and the gold of each base, respectively.\nOutput Print \n    s\n integers, the maximum amount of gold each spaceship can\nsteal, in the same order as the spaceships are given in the input. Example\nInput 5 4 1 3 5 2 4 0 1 4 2 2 8 9 4 Output 1 9 11 9 11 Note The first\nspaceship can only attack the first base. The second spaceship can attack the\nfirst and third bases. The third spaceship can attack the first, second and\nthird bases.\n\n",
