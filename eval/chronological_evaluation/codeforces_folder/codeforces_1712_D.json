O_o\nand Another Young Boy An array of \n    n\n positive integers\n\n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n fell down on you from the skies, along with a\npositive integer \n    k \n    \u2264 n\n. You can apply the following operation at\nmost \n    k\n times: Choose an index \n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n and an integer\n\n    1 \n    \u2264 x \n    \u2264 10^9\n. Then do \n    a_i := x\n (assign \n    x\n to\n\n    a_i\n). Then build a complete undirected weighted graph with \n    n\n\nvertices numbered with integers from \n    1\n to \n    n\n, where edge \n    (l,\n    r)\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 l < r \n    \u2264 n\n) has weight\n\n    min(a_l,a_l+1,\n    \u2026,a_r)\n. You have to find the maximum\npossible diameter of the resulting graph after performing at most \n    k\n\noperations. The diameter of a graph is equal to \n    max\n    _1 \n    \u2264 u\n    < v \n    \u2264 n\n    d(u, v)\n, where \n    d(u,\n    v)\n is the length of the shortest path between vertex \n    u\n and vertex\n\n    v\n. Input Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains\nthe number of test cases \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n). Description of\nthe test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers\n\n    n\n and \n    k\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 n\n). The\nsecond line of each test case contains \n    n\n positive integers\n\n    a_1,a_2,\n    \u2026,a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n). It is guaranteed\nthat the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output\nFor each test case print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible diameter of the\ngraph after performing at most \n    k\n operations.

The graph built on this array: \n    d(1, 2) =\n    \n    d(1, 3) = 2\n and \n    d(2, 3) = 4\n, so the\ndiameter is equal to \n    max(2,2,4) = 4\n.\n\n",
