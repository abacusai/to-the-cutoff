        "description": "\n    n\n players are playing a game. There are two different maps in the game.\nFor each player, we know his strength on each map. When two players fight on a\nspecific map, the player with higher strength on that map always wins. No two\nplayers have the same strength on the same map. You are the game master and\nwant to organize a tournament. There will be a total of \n    n-1\n battles.\nWhile there is more than one player in the tournament, choose any map and any\ntwo remaining players to fight on it. The player who loses will be eliminated\nfrom the tournament. In the end, exactly one player will remain, and he is\ndeclared the winner of the tournament. For each player determine if he can win\nthe tournament. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 100\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of test\ncases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of players. The second\nline of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n\n(\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    a_i \n    \u2260 a_j\n for \n    i \n    \u2260 j\n),\nwhere \n    a_i\n is the strength of the \n    i\n-th player on the first map. The\nthird line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    b_1, b_2, \n    \u2026,\n    b_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 b_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n, \n    b_i \n    \u2260 b_j\n for \n    i \n    \u2260\n    j\n), where \n    b_i\n is the strength of the \n    i\n-th player on the second\nmap. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not\nexceed \n    10^5\n. Output For each test case print a string of length \n    n\n.\n\n    i\n-th character should be \"1\" if the \n    i\n-th player can win the\ntournament, or \"0\" otherwise. Example Input 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 4 11 12 20 21\n44 22 11 30 1 1000000000 1000000000 Output 0001 1111 1 Note In the first test\ncase, the \n    4\n-th player will beat any other player on any game, so he will\ndefinitely win the tournament. In the second test case, everyone can be a\nwinner. In the third test case, there is only one player. Clearly, he will win\nthe tournament.\n\n",
