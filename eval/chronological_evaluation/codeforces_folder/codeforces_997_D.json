        "description": "Consider a tree (that is, an undirected connected graph without loops)\n\n    T_1\n and a tree \n    T_2\n. Let's define their cartesian product \n    T_1\n    \n    \u00d7 T_2\n in a following way. Let \n    V\n be the set of vertices in\n\n    T_1\n and \n    U\n be the set of vertices in \n    T_2\n. Then the set of\nvertices of graph \n    T_1 \n    \u00d7 T_2\n is \n    V \n    \u00d7 U\n, that is, a set\nof ordered pairs of vertices, where the first vertex in pair is from \n    V\n\nand the second \u2014 from \n    U\n. Let's draw the following edges: Between \n    (v,\n    u_1)\n and \n    (v, u_2)\n there is an undirected edge, if \n    u_1\n and\n\n    u_2\n are adjacent in \n    U\n. Similarly, between \n    (v_1, u)\n and\n\n    (v_2, u)\n there is an undirected edge, if \n    v_1\n and \n    v_2\n are\nadjacent in \n    V\n. Please see the notes section for the pictures of products\nof trees in the sample tests. Let's examine the graph \n    T_1 \n    \u00d7 T_2\n.\nHow much cycles (not necessarily simple) of length \n    k\n it contains? Since\nthis number can be very large, print it modulo \n    998244353\n. The sequence\nof vertices \n    w_1\n, \n    w_2\n, ..., \n    w_k\n, where \n    w_i \n    \u2208 V\n    \n    \u00d7 U\n called cycle, if any neighboring vertices are adjacent and\n\n    w_1\n is adjacent to \n    w_k\n. Cycles that differ only by the cyclic\nshift or direction of traversal are still considered different. Input First\nline of input contains three integers \u2014 \n    n_1\n, \n    n_2\n and \n    k\n (\n    2\n    \n    \u2264 n_1, n_2 \n    \u2264 4000\n, \n    2 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 75\n) \u2014 number of vertices\nin the first tree, number of vertices in the second tree and the cycle length\nrespectively. Then follow \n    n_1 - 1\n lines describing the first tree. Each\nof this lines contains two integers \u2014 \n    v_i, u_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 v_i, u_i\n    \n    \u2264 n_1\n), which define edges of the first tree. Then follow \n    n_2 - 1\n\nlines, which describe the second tree in the same format. It is guaranteed,\nthat given graphs are trees. Output Print one integer \u2014 number of cycles\nmodulo \n    998244353\n. Examples Input 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 Output 8 Input 2 2 4 1 2\n1 2 Output 32 Input 2 3 4 1 2 1 2 1 3 Output 70 Input 4 2 2 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 2\nOutput 20 Note The following three pictures illustrate graph, which are\nproducts of the trees from sample tests. In the first example, the list of\ncycles of length \n    2\n is as follows: \u00abAB\u00bb, \u00abBA\u00bb \u00abBC\u00bb, \u00abCB\u00bb \u00abAD\u00bb, \u00abDA\u00bb \u00abCD\u00bb,\n\u00abDC\u00bb\n\n",
