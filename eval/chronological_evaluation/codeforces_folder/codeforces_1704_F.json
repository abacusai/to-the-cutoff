        "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. There are \n    n\n cells in a row. Initially\neach cell is either red or blue. Alice goes first. On each turn, Alice chooses\ntwo neighbouring cells which contain at least one red cell, and paints that\ntwo cells white. Then, Bob chooses two neighbouring cells which contain at\nleast one blue cell, and paints that two cells white. The player who cannot\nmake a move loses. Find the winner if both Alice and Bob play optimally. Note\nthat a chosen cell can be white, as long as the other cell satisfies the\nconstraints. Input The first line contains a single integer \n    t\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of test cases\nfollows. For each test case, the first line contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    2\n    \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of cells. The second line\ncontains a string \n    s\n of length \n    n\n \u2014 the initial state of the cells.\nThe \n    i\n-th cell is red if \n    s_i =\n R, blue if \n    s_i =\n B. It is\nguaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed \n    5\n    \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For each test case, output the name of the winner on a\nseparate line. Example Input 8 3 BRB 5 RRBBB 6 RBRBRB 8 BBRRBRRB 6 BRRBRB 12\nRBRBRBRBRRBB 12 RBRBRBRBBBRR 4 RBBR Output Bob Bob Alice Alice Alice Alice Bob\nBob Note In the notes, the cell numbers increase from left to right. In the\nfirst testcase for Alice, she has two choices: paint the first and the second\ncells, or paint the second and the third cells. No matter what choice Alice\nmakes, there will be exactly one blue cell after Alice's move. Bob just needs\nto paint the blue cell and its neighbour, then every cell will be white and\nAlice can't make a move. So Bob is the winner. In the second testcase no\nmatter what Alice chooses, Bob can choose to paint the fourth and fifth cells\nin \n    2\n turns. In the third testcase at first, Alice paints the third and\nthe fourth cells. It doesn't matter if Bob paints the first and the second\ncells or the fifth and sixth cells, as Alice can paint the other two cells. In\nthe fourth testcase at first, Alice paints the second and the third cells. If\nBob paints the fifth and the sixth cells or the fourth and the fifth cells,\nthen Alice paints the seventh and the eighth cells. If Bob paints the seventh\nand the eighth cells, then Alice paints the fifth and the sixth cells. In the\nfifth Alice chooses the middle two cells at first, then Bob obviously has only\ntwo options, whichever variant he chooses, Alice can choose the other one and\nwin. In the eighth no matter what Alice chooses, Bob can choose the other two\nsymmetrical cells.\n\n",
