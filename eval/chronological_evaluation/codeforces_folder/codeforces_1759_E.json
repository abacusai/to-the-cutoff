        "description": "There are \n    n\n astronauts working on some space station. An astronaut with\nthe number \n    i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n) has power \n    a_i\n. An evil\nhumanoid has made his way to this space station. The power of this humanoid is\nequal to \n    h\n. Also, the humanoid took with him two green serums and one\nblue serum. In one second , a humanoid can do any of three actions: to absorb\nan astronaut with power strictly less humanoid power; to use green serum, if\nthere is still one left; to use blue serum, if there is still one left. When\nan astronaut with power \n    a_i\n is absorbed, this astronaut disappears, and\npower of the humanoid increases by \n    \u230a\n    a_i/2\n    \u230b\n,\nthat is, an integer part of \n    a_i/2\n. For example, if a humanoid\nabsorbs an astronaut with power \n    4\n, its power increases by \n    2\n, and\nif a humanoid absorbs an astronaut with power \n    7\n, its power increases by\n\n    3\n. After using the green serum, this serum disappears, and the power of\nthe humanoid doubles, so it increases by \n    2\n times. After using the blue\nserum, this serum disappears, and the power of the humanoid triples, so it\nincreases by \n    3\n times. The humanoid is wondering what the maximum number\nof astronauts he will be able to absorb if he acts optimally. Input The first\nline of each test contains an integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014\nnumber of test cases. The first line of each test case contains integers\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n) \u2014 number of astronauts and\n\n    h\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 h \n    \u2264 10^6\n) \u2014 the initial power of the humanoid. The\nsecond line of each test case contains \n    n\n integers \n    a_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264\n    a_i \n    \u2264 10^8\n) \u2014 powers of astronauts. It is guaranteed that the sum of\n\n    n\n for all test cases does not exceed \n    2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n. Output For\neach test case, in a separate line, print the maximum number of astronauts\nthat a humanoid can absorb.
