        "description": "Burenka is about to watch the most interesting sporting event of the year \u2014 a\nfighting tournament organized by her friend Tonya. \n    n\n athletes\nparticipate in the tournament, numbered from \n    1\n to \n    n\n. Burenka\ndetermined the strength of the \n    i\n-th athlete as an integer \n    a_i\n,\nwhere \n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n. All the strength values are different, that\nis, the array \n    a\n is a permutation of length \n    n\n. We know that in a\nfight, if \n    a_i > a_j\n, then the \n    i\n-th participant always wins the\n\n    j\n-th. The tournament goes like this: initially, all \n    n\n athletes\nline up in ascending order of their ids, and then there are infinitely many\nfighting rounds. In each round there is exactly one fight: the first two\npeople in line come out and fight. The winner goes back to the front of the\nline, and the loser goes to the back. Burenka decided to ask Tonya \n    q\n\nquestions. In each question, Burenka asks how many victories the \n    i\n-th\nparticipant gets in the first \n    k\n rounds of the competition for some given\nnumbers \n    i\n and \n    k\n. Tonya is not very good at analytics, so he asks\nyou to help him answer all the questions. Input The first line contains one\ninteger \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 10^4\n) \u2014 the number of test cases.\nDescription of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case\ncontains two integers \n    n\n and \n    q\n (\n    2 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n, \n    1\n    \n    \u2264 q \n    \u2264 10^5\n) \u2014 the number of tournament participants and the\nnumber of questions. The second line of each test case contains \n    n\n\nintegers \n    a_1, a_2, \n    \u2026, a_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the\narray \n    a\n, which is a permutation. The next \n    q\n lines of a test case\ncontain questions. Each line contains two integers \n    i\n and \n    k\n (\n    1\n    \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 n\n, \n    1 \n    \u2264 k \n    \u2264 10^9\n) \u2014 the number of the\nparticipant and the number of rounds. It is guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n\nand the sum of \n    q\n over all test cases do not exceed \n    10^5\n. Output\nFor each Burenka's question, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the\nanswer to the question. Example Input 3 3 1 3 1 2 1 2 4 2 1 3 4 2 4 5 3 2 5 2\n1 2 3 5 4 5 1000000000 4 6 Output 2 0 1 0 4 Note In the first test case, the\nfirst numbered athlete has the strength of \n    3\n, in the first round he will\ndefeat the athlete with the number \n    2\n and the strength of \n    1\n, and in\nthe second round, the athlete with the number \n    3\n and the strength of\n\n    2\n. In the second test case, we list the strengths of the athletes\nfighting in the first \n    5\n fights: \n    1\n and \n    3\n, \n    3\n and\n\n    4\n, \n    4\n and \n    2\n, \n    4\n and \n    1\n, \n    4\n and \n    3\n. The\nparticipant with the number \n    4\n in the first \n    5\n rounds won \n    0\n\ntimes (his strength is \n    2\n). The participant with the number \n    3\n has a\nstrength of \n    4\n and won \n    1\n time in the first two fights by fighting\n\n    1\n time.\n\n",
