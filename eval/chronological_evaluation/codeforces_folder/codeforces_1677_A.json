        "description": "Tokitsukaze has a permutation \n    p\n of length \n    n\n. Recall that a\npermutation \n    p\n of length \n    n\n is a sequence \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026,\n    p_n\n consisting of \n    n\n distinct integers, each of which from \n    1\n to\n\n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n). She wants to know how many different\nindices tuples \n    [a,b,c,d]\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a < b < c < d \n    \u2264 n\n) in this\npermutation satisfy the following two inequalities: \n    p_a < p_c\n and \n    p_b\n    > p_d\n. Note that two tuples \n    [a_1,b_1,c_1,d_1]\n and\n\n    [a_2,b_2,c_2,d_2]\n are considered to be different if \n    a_1 \n     a_2\n\nor \n    b_1 \n     b_2\n or \n    c_1 \n     c_2\n or \n    d_1 \n     d_2\n. Input\nThe first line contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n) \u2014\nthe number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line\ncontains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    4 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 5000\n) \u2014 the length\nof permutation \n    p\n. The second line contains \n    n\n integers \n    p_1, p_2,\n    \n    \u2026, p_n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 n\n) \u2014 the permutation \n    p\n. It\nis guaranteed that the sum of \n    n\n over all test cases does not exceed\n\n    5000\n. Output For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the number of\ndifferent \n    [a,b,c,d]\n tuples. Example Input 3 6 5 3 6 1 4 2 4 1 2 3 4 10 5\n1 6 2 8 3 4 10 9 7 Output 3 0 28 Note In the first test case, there are\n\n    3\n different \n    [a,b,c,d]\n tuples. \n    p_1 = 5\n, \n    p_2 = 3\n, \n    p_3\n    = 6\n, \n    p_4 = 1\n, where \n    p_1 < p_3\n and \n    p_2 > p_4\n satisfies the\ninequality, so one of \n    [a,b,c,d]\n tuples is \n    [1,2,3,4]\n. Similarly,\nother two tuples are \n    [1,2,3,6]\n, \n    [2,3,5,6]\n.\n\n",
