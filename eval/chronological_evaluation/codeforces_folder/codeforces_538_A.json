        "description": "A large banner with word CODEFORCES was ordered for the 1000-th onsite round\nof Codeforces^\u03c9 that takes place on the Miami beach. Unfortunately, the\ncompany that made the banner mixed up two orders and delivered somebody else's\nbanner that contains someone else's word. The word on the banner consists only\nof upper-case English letters. There is very little time to correct the\nmistake. All that we can manage to do is to cut out some substring from the\nbanner, i.e. several consecutive letters. After that all the resulting parts\nof the banner will be glued into a single piece (if the beginning or the end\nof the original banner was cut out, only one part remains); it is not allowed\nchange the relative order of parts of the banner (i.e. after a substring is\ncut, several first and last letters are left, it is allowed only to glue the\nlast letters to the right of the first letters). Thus, for example, for\nexample, you can cut a substring out from string 'TEMPLATE' and get string\n'TEMPLE' (if you cut out string AT), 'PLATE' (if you cut out TEM), 'T' (if you\ncut out EMPLATE), etc. Help the organizers of the round determine whether it\nis possible to cut out of the banner some substring in such a way that the\nremaining parts formed word CODEFORCES. Input The single line of the input\ncontains the word written on the banner. The word only consists of upper-case\nEnglish letters. The word is non-empty and its length doesn't exceed 100\ncharacters. It is guaranteed that the word isn't word CODEFORCES. Output Print\n'YES', if there exists a way to cut out the substring, and 'NO' otherwise\n(without the quotes). Examples Input CODEWAITFORITFORCES Output YES Input\nBOTTOMCODER Output NO Input DECODEFORCES Output YES Input DOGEFORCES Output NO\n\n",
