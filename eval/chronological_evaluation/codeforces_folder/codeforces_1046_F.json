        "description": "After finding and moving to the new planet that supports human life,\ndiscussions started on which currency should be used. After long negotiations,\nBitcoin was ultimately chosen as the universal currency. These were the great\nnews for Alice, whose grandfather got into Bitcoin mining in 2013, and\naccumulated a lot of them throughout the years. Unfortunately, when paying\nsomething in bitcoin everyone can see how many bitcoins you have in your\npublic address wallet. This worried Alice, so she decided to split her\nbitcoins among multiple different addresses, so that every address has at most\n\n    x\n satoshi (1 bitcoin = \n    10^8\n satoshi). She can create new public\naddress wallets for free and is willing to pay \n    f\n fee in satoshi per\ntransaction to ensure acceptable speed of transfer. The fee is deducted from\nthe address the transaction was sent from. Tell Alice how much total fee in\nsatoshi she will need to pay to achieve her goal. Input First line contains\nnumber \n    N\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 N \n    \u2264 200\n     000\n) representing total number\nof public addresses Alice has. Next line contains \n    N\n integer numbers\n\n    a_i\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 a_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) separated by a single space,\nrepresenting how many satoshi Alice has in her public addresses. Last line\ncontains two numbers \n    x\n, \n    f\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 f < x \n    \u2264 10^9\n)\nrepresenting maximum number of satoshies Alice can have in one address, as\nwell as fee in satoshies she is willing to pay per transaction. Output Output\none integer number representing total fee in satoshi Alice will need to pay to\nachieve her goal. Example Input 3 13 7 6 6 2 Output 4 Note Alice can make two\ntransactions in a following way: 01\u03073 7 6 (initial state) 16\u0307 7 6 5\n(create new address and transfer from first public address 5 satoshies) 26\u0307\n4 6 5 1 (create new address and transfer from second address 1 satoshi) Since\ncost per transaction is 2 satoshies, total fee is 4.\n\n",
