        "description": "Dasha, an excellent student, is studying at the best mathematical lyceum in\nthe country. Recently, a mysterious stranger brought \n    n\n words consisting\nof small latin letters \n    s_1, s_2, \n    \u2026, s_n\n to the lyceum. Since that\nday, Dasha has been tormented by nightmares. Consider some pair of integers\n\n    \u27e8 i, j \n    \u27e9\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 i \n    \u2264 j \n    \u2264 n\n). A nightmare\nis a string for which it is true: It is obtained by concatenation\n\n    s_is_j\n; Its length is odd; The number of different letters in it is\nexactly \n    25\n; The number of occurrences of each letter that is in the word\nis odd. For example, if \n    s_i=\n \"abcdefg\" and \n    s_j=\n\n\"ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\", the pair \n    \u27e8 i, j \n    \u27e9\n creates a\nnightmare. Dasha will stop having nightmares if she counts their number. There\nare too many nightmares, so Dasha needs your help. Count the number of\ndifferent nightmares. Nightmares are called different if the corresponding\npairs \n    \u27e8 i, j \n    \u27e9\n are different. The pairs \n    \u27e8\n    i_1, j_1 \n    \u27e9\n and \n    \u27e8 i_2, j_2 \n    \u27e9\n are called\ndifferent if \n    i_1 \n    \u2260 i_2\n or \n    j_1 \n    \u2260 j_2\n. Input The first\nline contains a single integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 2 \n    \u00b7 10^5\n)\n\u2014 the number of words. The following \n    n\n lines contain the words \n    s_1,\n    s_2, \n    \u2026, s_n\n, consisting of small latin letters. It is guaranteed\nthat the total length of words does not exceed \n    5 \n    \u00b7 10^6\n. Output\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of different nightmares.
