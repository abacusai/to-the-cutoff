        "description": "DLS and JLS are bored with a Math lesson. In order to entertain themselves,\nDLS took a sheet of paper and drew \n    n\n distinct lines, given by equations\n\n    y = x + p_i\n for some distinct \n    p_1, p_2, \n    \u2026, p_n\n. Then JLS\ndrew on the same paper sheet \n    m\n distinct lines given by equations \n    y =\n    -x + q_i\n for some distinct \n    q_1, q_2, \n    \u2026, q_m\n. DLS and JLS are\ninterested in counting how many line pairs have integer intersection points,\ni.e. points with both coordinates that are integers. Unfortunately, the lesson\nwill end up soon, so DLS and JLS are asking for your help. Input The first\nline contains one integer \n    t\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 t \n    \u2264 1000\n), the number of\ntest cases in the input. Then follow the test case descriptions. The first\nline of a test case contains an integer \n    n\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 n \n    \u2264 10^5\n),\nthe number of lines drawn by DLS. The second line of a test case contains\n\n    n\n distinct integers \n    p_i\n (\n    0 \n    \u2264 p_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) describing\nthe lines drawn by DLS. The integer \n    p_i\n describes a line given by the\nequation \n    y = x + p_i\n. The third line of a test case contains an integer\n\n    m\n (\n    1 \n    \u2264 m \n    \u2264 10^5\n), the number of lines drawn by JLS. The\nfourth line of a test case contains \n    m\n distinct integers \n    q_i\n (\n    0\n    \n    \u2264 q_i \n    \u2264 10^9\n) describing the lines drawn by JLS. The integer\n\n    q_i\n describes a line given by the equation \n    y = -x + q_i\n. The sum\nof the values of \n    n\n over all test cases in the input does not exceed\n\n    10^5\n. Similarly, the sum of the values of \n    m\n over all test cases in\nthe input does not exceed \n    10^5\n. In hacks it is allowed to use only one\ntest case in the input, so \n    t=1\n should be satisfied. Output For each test\ncase in the input print a single integer \u2014 the number of line pairs with\ninteger intersection points. Example Input 3 3 1 3 2 2 0 3 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1\nOutput 3 1 0 Note The picture shows the lines from the first test case of the\nexample. Black circles denote intersection points with integer coordinates.\n\n",
