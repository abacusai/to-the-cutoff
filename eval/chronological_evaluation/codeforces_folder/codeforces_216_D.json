        "description": "Paw the Spider is making a web. Web-making is a real art, Paw has been\nlearning to do it his whole life. Let's consider the structure of the web.\nThere are n main threads going from the center of the web. All main threads\nare located in one plane and divide it into n equal infinite sectors. The\nsectors are indexed from 1 to n in the clockwise direction. Sectors i and i +\n1 are adjacent for every i, 1 \u2264 i < n. In addition, sectors 1 and n are also\nadjacent. Some sectors have bridge threads. Each bridge connects the two main\nthreads that make up this sector. The points at which the bridge is attached\nto the main threads will be called attachment points. Both attachment points\nof a bridge are at the same distance from the center of the web. At each\nattachment point exactly one bridge is attached. The bridges are adjacent if\nthey are in the same sector, and there are no other bridges between them. A\ncell of the web is a trapezoid, which is located in one of the sectors and is\nbounded by two main threads and two adjacent bridges. You can see that the\nsides of the cell may have the attachment points of bridges from adjacent\nsectors. If the number of attachment points on one side of the cell is not\nequal to the number of attachment points on the other side, it creates an\nimbalance of pulling forces on this cell and this may eventually destroy the\nentire web. We'll call such a cell unstable. The perfect web does not contain\nunstable cells. Unstable cells are marked red in the figure. Stable cells are\nmarked green. Paw the Spider isn't a skillful webmaker yet, he is only\nlearning to make perfect webs. Help Paw to determine the number of unstable\ncells in the web he has just spun. Input The first line contains integer n (3\n\u2264 n \u2264 1000) \u2014 the number of main threads. The i-th of following n lines\ndescribe the bridges located in the i-th sector: first it contains integer ki\n(1 \u2264 ki \u2264 10^5) equal to the number of bridges in the given sector. Then\nfollow ki different integers pij (1 \u2264 pij \u2264 10^5; 1 \u2264 j \u2264 ki). Number pij\nequals the distance from the attachment points of the j-th bridge of the i-th\nsector to the center of the web. It is guaranteed that any two bridges between\nadjacent sectors are attached at a different distance from the center of the\nweb. It is guaranteed that the total number of the bridges doesn't exceed\n10^5. Output Print a single integer \u2014 the number of unstable cells in Paw the\nSpider's web.
